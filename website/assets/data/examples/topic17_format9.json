        "text":"\n\nMust Read Op-Eds for Thursday, January 19, 2012\n\n\nTHE 1% AND THAT 15%EDITORIALNEW YORK TIMESMr. Romney is clearly hoping that by drawing this process [of releasing his 2011 tax return] out for another three months, and copping to the low rate early on, he will deflect at least some of the shock about the size of his personal wealth and what a great deal you get from the government if, like Mr. Romney, you make most of your money from investing. ..\u00a0 If Mr. Romney has done one good thing with his partial disclosure \u2014 although it clearly wasn\u2019t his goal \u2014 he has reminded Americans of the fundamental unfairness of the current tax code and of how determined Mr. Romney and his party are to keep it that way. ... Mr. Romney does not have to apologize for his wealth. But he cannot keep trying to conceal just how much the tax code has been tilted in his favor.\n\nIS BANKING BAD?BY NICHOLAS KRISTOFNEW YORK TIMESIs it unethical to make millions in private equity? ... I\u2019ve been sympathetic to the Occupy Wall Street movement, but, look, finance is not evil. ... (T)he attacks on private equity seem over the top. Private equity firms like Bain Capital, where Romney worked, aren\u2019t about destroying companies and picking over the carcasses. Rather, the aim is to acquire poorly managed companies, make them more efficient (sometimes by firing people but often by rejiggering the business model) and then resell them at a profit. That\u2019s the merciless, rugged nature of capitalism.\n\n\nANCHORS AWEIGH, MY BOYSBY GAIL COLLINSNEW YORK TIMESThe South Carolina primary has been one long obsession with Mitt Romney\u2019s extreme richness. This is partly because Newt Gingrich keeps carping on it. Which, to be honest, we have enjoyed very much. But, mainly, it\u2019s because Mitt is so weird and off-putting on the subject. Like the time he told people he was unemployed. ... Gingrich is proving that he is the top debater in the field. Truly, if the office of president of the United States involved nothing but debating in front of enthusiastic Republican audiences, he would be far and away the best possible choice. If nominated, Newt promises that he will follow Barack Obama around the country challenging him to a series of three-hour-long \u201cLincoln-Douglas\u201d debates. He can already imagine it! I bet you can, too.\n\nA GOOD CALL ON THE PIPELINEEDITORIALNEW YORK TIMESPresident Obama has properly rejected, at least for now, the Keystone XL oil pipeline that would run from Canada to the Gulf Coast. He rebuffed the demand of House Republicans that the controversial project be decided in haste under an election-year deadline. ... Lobbyists and House Republicans have tried to sell the project as a reduction in America\u2019s dependence on Middle Eastern oil. But much of the pipeline oil that would be refined on the Gulf Coast would be destined for foreign export.\u00a0 Far more important to the nation\u2019s energy and environmental future is the development of renewable and alternative energy sources. This is the winning case that Mr. Obama should make to voters in rejecting the Republicans\u2019 craven indulgence of Big Oil.\n\nROMNEY'S TAX RETURNS SHOULD ONLY BE THE START OF HIS DISCLOSURESEDITORIALWASHINGTON POSTMr. Romney might learn from his ham-handed handling of the tax issue and deal with another disclosure lapse: the names of his \u201cbundlers,\u201d the well-connected supporters who haul in hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. As with tax returns, candidates are not required by law to release this information; as with tax returns, it is pertinent, and most candidates in recent years, including Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain, have provided it. ... In the age of the super PAC, knowing the names of a candidate\u2019s bundlers, and the degree to which they have helped, is important in tracing links between the individual campaign and the theoretically independent political action committee. Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign has not addressed our requests for this information. We intend to keep asking.\n\nTHE ANTI-JOBS PRESIDENTEDITORIALWALL STREET JOURNAL\u00a0Environmentalists seem to think they can prevent the development of Canada's oil-rich tar sands, and that their rallies against Keystone XL will keep that carbon in the ground. They can't, and it won't. America's largest trading partner will simply build a pipeline to the Pacific coast from Alberta and sell its petroleum products to Asia instead, China in particular. Such green delusions are sad, and Mr. Obama's pandering is sadder, though everything the country stands to lose is saddest. If Mitt Romney and the other GOP candidates have any political wit, they'll vindicate the Keystone's \"national interest\" and make Mr. Obama explain why job creation is less important than the people who make a living working for the green anti-industrial complex.\n\nBAIN CAPITAL SAVED AMERICABY DANIEL HENNINGERWALL STREET JOURNALNot only did Bain Capital save America, but no matter what turn Mitt Romney's political career takes, Bain Capital may stand as the best of Mr. Romney's lifetime contributions to the nation's economic well-being. If only he'd tell the story. ... Properly understood, the 1980s, including Bain, were the remarkable years when an ever-resilient America found a way to save itself from becoming what Europe is now\u2014a global has-been. ... Every voter seems to sense that finding the answer to what comes next for America's economic fortunes makes this election huge. ... [Voters] want someone who understands how the next 10 years can produce an American economy that offers the opportunities for them that the 1980s produced for Mitt Romney.\n\nGOP SHOULD HEED RON PAULBY MICHAEL TANNERNATIONAL REVIEWWhat... can Republicans do to keep Paul\u2019s supporters in the tent? Well, to start with, instead of deriding Paul as a RINO or some sort of a crank, and hoping his supporters go away, they might begin to take some of his ideas seriously. ... That would mean putting forward detailed plans to reduce the size, cost, and intrusiveness of government. ... For years, Republican candidates have worried that if they didn\u2019t hew to the hardest line possible on social issues, religious conservatives would stay home on Election Day. Economic conservatives, libertarians, and believers in smaller, constitutional government were never given similar deference. The result was a Republican party that drifted ever further away from its Goldwater-Reagan roots. But that may be about to change. If not, Republicans can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned.",

As the judges for these annual awards, we do our best to identify the most deserving recipients of this unwelcome plaudit.\n\nAnd now, the P.U.-litzers Prizes for 2008:\n\nHot For Obama Prize\n\nChris Matthews of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball\u201d\n\nThis award sparked fierce competition, but the cinch came on the day Obama swept the Potomac Primary in February\u2014when Chris Matthews spoke of \u201cthe feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama\u2019s speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don\u2019t have that too often.\u201d\n\nBeyond Parody Prize\n\nFox News\n\nIn August, a teaser for the \u201cO\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d program said: \u201cObama bombarded by personal attacks. Are they legit? Ann Coulter comments.\u201d\n\nUpside Down \"Elitist\" Award\n\nNew York Times Columnist David Brooks\n\nFor months, high-paid Beltway journalists competed with each other in advising candidate Obama on how to mingle with working-class folks. Ubiquitous pundit Brooks won the prize for his wisdom on reaching \u201cless educated people, downscale people,\u201d offered on MSNBC in June: \u201cObama\u2019s problem is he doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of guy who could go into an Applebee\u2019s salad bar and people think he fits in naturally there. And so he\u2019s had to change to try to be more like that Applebee\u2019s guy.\u201d It would indeed be hard for Obama to fit in naturally at an Applebee\u2019s salad bar. Applebee\u2019s restaurants don\u2019t have salad bars.\n\nGutter Ball Punditry Award\n\nChris Matthews of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball\u201d\n\nIn program after program during the spring, Matthews repeatedly questioned whether Obama could connect with \u201cregular\u201d voters\u2014\u201cregular\u201d meaning voters who are white or \u201cwho actually do know how to bowl.\u201d He once said of Obama: \u201cThis gets very ethnic, but the fact that he\u2019s good at basketball doesn\u2019t surprise anybody. But the fact that he\u2019s that terrible at bowling does make you wonder.\u201d\n\nStraight Skinny Prize\n\nWall Street Journal Reporter Amy Chozick\n\n\u201c ... The fact that he\u2019s good at basketball doesn\u2019t surprise anybody. But the fact that he\u2019s that terrible at bowling does make you wonder.\u201d\n\nIn August, the Journal\u2019s Chozick went beyond the standard elitist charge to offer yet another reason average voters might be wary of Obama. Below the headline \u201cToo Fit To Be President?\u201d she wrote of Obama: \u201cDespite his visits to waffle houses, ice cream parlors and greasy-spoon diners around the country, his slim physique might have some Americans wondering whether he is truly like them.\u201d Chozick asked: \u201cIn a nation in which 66 percent of the voting-age population is overweight and 32 percent is obese, could Sen. Obama\u2019s skinniness be a liability?\u201d To support her argument, she quoted Hillary Clinton supporters. One said: \u201cHe needs to put some meat on his bones.\u201d Another, prodded by Chozick, wrote on a Yahoo bulletin board: \u201cI won\u2019t vote for any beanpole guy.\u201d\n\n\"Our Center-Right Nation\" Award\n\nNewsweek Editor Jon Meacham\n\nWith Democrats in the process of winning big in 2008 as they had in 2006, a media chorus erupted, warning Democratic politicians away from their promises of change. Behind the warnings was the repeated claim that America is essentially a conservative country. In an election-eve Newsweek cover story with the sub-headline \u201cAmerica remains a center-right nation\u2014a fact that a President Obama would forget at his peril,\u201d Meacham argued that the liberalism of even repeatedly re-elected FDR offended voters. And the editor claimed that a leftward trend in election results and issues polling means little\u2014as would Obama\u2019s victory after months of charges that he stood for radical change. Evidence seemed to lose out to journalists\u2019 fears that campaign promises might actually be kept.\n\nBailout Bluster Award\n\nPundit David Brooks\n\nOn Sept. 30, just after the House defeated the $700 billion Wall Street bailout measure, Brooks\u2019 column in the New York Times denounced the balking House members for their failure to heed \u201cthe collected expertise of the Treasury and Fed.\u201d But a week later, after the House approved a bailout\u2014and with the credit crunch unabated and stock market still plunging\u2014Brooks wrote: \u201cAt these moments, central bankers and Treasury officials leap in to try to make the traders feel better. Officials pretend they\u2019re coming up with policy responses, but much of what they do is political theater.\u201d Now he tells us.\n\n\"Status Quo Centrists Can't Be Ideologues\" Award\n\nToo Many to Name\n\nIn late November, corporate media outlets began to credit Barack Obama with making supposedly non-ideological Cabinet picks. The New York Times front page reported that his choices \u201csuggest that Mr. Obama is planning to govern from the center-right of his party, surrounding himself with pragmatists rather than ideologues.\u201d Conservative Times columnist David Brooks praised the picks as \u201cnot ideological\u201d and the economic nominees as \u201cmoderate and thoughtful Democrats.\u201d USA Today reported that Obama\u2019s selections had \u201crecords that display more pragmatism than ideology.\u201d In mediaspeak, if you thought invading Iraq and signing the NAFTA trade pact were good ideas, you\u2019re a pragmatist. If not, you\u2019re an ideologue.\n\n\"Who Would Have Predicted?\" Award\n\nNew York Times\n\nThe Times op-ed page marked the fifth anniversary of the Iraq invasion in March by choosing \u201cnine experts on military and foreign affairs\u201d to write on \u201cthe one aspect of the war that most surprised them or that they wish they had considered in the prewar debate.\u201d None of the experts selected had opposed the invasion. That kind of exclusion made possible a bizarre claim by Times correspondent John Burns in the same day\u2019s paper: \u201cOnly the most prescient could have guessed ... that the toll would include tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians killed, as well as nearly 4,000 American troops; or that America\u2019s financial costs, by some recent estimates, would rise above $650 billion by 2008.\u201d Those who\u2019d warned of such disastrous results were not only prescient, but were routinely excluded from mainstream coverage.\n\nImperially Embedded Prize\n\nNew York Times Reporter John Burns\n\nDescribed as \u201cthe longest-serving foreign correspondent in New York Times history,\u201d Burns seemed less a skeptical reporter than a channeler of Henry Kissinger when he offered his world view to PBS\u2019 Charlie Rose in April: \u201cThe United States and its predominant economic, political and military power in the world have been the single greatest force for stability in the world, such as it is now, certainly since the Second World War. If the outcome in Iraq were to destroy the credibility of American power, to destroy America\u2019s willingness to use its power in the world to achieve good, to fight back against totalitarianism, authoritarianism, gross human rights abuses, it would be a very dark day.\u201d\n\nNorman Solomon is the author of the new book War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death .\n\nJeff Cohen is the author of the new book Cable News Confidential: My Misadventures in Corporate Media .\n\n\n  \u2022 Select sidebar boxes to add below.

        "text":"Sunday April 23, 2017\n| Last update: Friday at 9:16 PM\n\nTop 5 progressive horror films for activists on Halloween\n\nAnalysis by Dave Schneider |\nOctober 28, 2013\nRead more articles in\n\nOdds are that Karl Marx would have enjoyed horror movies.\n\nThe German revolutionary and author of The Communist Manifesto died almost 40 years before the release of Nosferatu, the first commercially successful horror movie. But as a harsh critic of capitalism and colonialism, Marx was familiar with his fair share of real life horrors perpetrated by the capitalist class on working and oppressed people. 100 years before Night of the Living Dead, Marx was already likening capitalist oppression to the undead: \u201cCapital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks.\u201d\n\nAbout a century later, Malcolm X would echo these sentiments and say, \u201cShow me a capitalist, and I\u2019ll show you a bloodsucker.\u201d For Malcolm X and other freedom fighters throughout history, the system of imperialism faced by African Americans and other oppressed people was a real-life house of horrors full of violence and exploitation, literally sucking the life out of its victims. It\u2019s precisely this reflection of the real conditions of oppression around us, especially in the U.S., that make horror films so interesting for activists and revolutionaries.\n\nAll movies reflect the culture, politics and conditions around them, but horror films in particular reflect our collective fears as a society - and sometimes the fears that our rulers want us to have. For instance, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is only remembered now as an early slasher film. But in 1974 when it was released, the story was a terrifyingly exaggerated reflection of people\u2019s real concerns: five young hippie kids go looking for gasoline after their car breaks down in Texas - a very common problem given the gas shortages from the 1973 oil embargo - and get terrorized by a family of unemployed meatpackers, who turned to maniacal violence only after losing their jobs to technology and outsourcing by the 1%.\n\nSometimes horror films reflect the genuinely terrifying outlook of the right wing. The wave of slasher flicks in the 1980s reflected the rise of Ronald Reagan and the Christian Right, who violently imposed their vision of trickle-down economics and \u2018family values\u2019 on women, poor and working people and the youth. Similarly, The Exorcist (1973) was a thinly-veiled reactionary statement against single working mothers and the threat that science posed to conservative religious orthodoxy.\n\nThe post-9\/11 period featured horror films eerily reflective of the things people saw on the news, whether it was terrorists on video tapes (The Ring), exploding buildings in Manhattan (Cloverfield), torture (Saw, Hostel), or right-wing religious fanatics (The Mist).\n\nToday, it\u2019s no surprise that the most successful horror films since the 2008 economic crisis all dealt with insecurity about people\u2019s homes - whether its bankers haunted by the victims of foreclosures in Drag Me To Hell or traditional haunted house flicks like Insidious, Paranormal Activity, Sinister and The Conjuring.\n\nA few horror films particularly reflect what Malcolm X called \u201cthe American nightmare\u201d of exploitation and oppression. Social justice activists can use these films as a jumping-off point for conversations about the very real horrific imperialist system that we face today. For activists looking for a couple of scary but socially-conscious movies for Halloween 2013, I present the top five most progressive horror movies:\n\n5. The Purge (2013)\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem right not putting a recent horror flick on this list, and The Purge holds its own with the rest of the list. Written like an episode of Rod Serling\u2019s The Twilight Zone, the film takes place in a dystopian future U.S. where a fascist group called the New Founding Fathers seized state power in a coup and implemented an annual, 12-hour event called \u201cthe purge.\u201d During the purge, all criminal activity - including murder - becomes legal, which allows the rich to literally hunt down the poor or hide away in expensive defense fortresses that only they can afford. The Purge follows the lives of a wealthy family that gets attacked by a fascist gang of racist vigilantes after they give refuge to an African American man during the night. In the wake of the murder of Trayvon Martin and the outrageous Zimmerman verdict, The Purge has some genuinely scary and disturbing moments that make us reflect on the real police and vigilante violence inflicted on African Americans, Latinos and other oppressed nationalities every day.\n\n4. Tales From the Hood (1995)\n\nTales From the Hood was Spike Lee\u2019s entry into the horror genre and although it\u2019s not necessarily the scariest film because of its occasionally tongue-in-cheek humor, it stands out as one of the most anti-racist horror films ever made. Tales From the Hood is told as an anthology, the premise being that three gang members are told four stories by a funeral home owner named Mr. Simms. The stories range from the ghost of a civil rights activist haunting the police officers who murdered him to the souls of dead slaves exacting revenge on a Ku Klux Klan politician, who converts an old slave plantation into his office. The most striking part of the film is that although some of the horror elements are over the top, like the use of ghosts, none of the disturbing stories are unrealistic. Police or racist vigilantes murder African Americans every 36 hours, and many of the politicians in office today have extensive connections to fascist groups like the Klan. Tales From the Hood had a poor theatrical run, but it\u2019s made a comeback on Netflix and deserves a Halloween viewing by activists in the US.\n\n3. George Romero\u2019s Dead Series (1968, 1978, 1985, 2005)\n\nI cheated a little with this entry by rolling four films into one, but I can\u2019t preference one of Romero\u2019s four classic zombie films over the others. Night of the Living Dead (1968) feels very dated and hardly scary anymore, but activists will still find its commentary on racism and national oppression powerful today. The not-so-subtle Dawn of the Dead (1978) is an extended critique of rampant consumerism and Day of the Dead (1985) asks the audience to consider whether the U.S. military is a greater threat to humanity than the undead \u2018enemies\u2019 they claim to fight. Land of the Dead brings it all together in a zombie-filled class war that also comments on the U.S.\u2019s destructive immigration policies. Some of the films are scarier than others, but all four are required viewing for activist horror fans.\n\n2. Candyman (1992)\n\nSet predominantly in a Chicago public housing project, Candyman on its face is about an urban legend involving a hook-handed killer who appears when you say his name five times into a mirror. In actuality, this underrated early 90s classic harshly criticizes white liberal racism and academia\u2019s fixation on studying - but never solving - poverty and national oppression. Candyman, seemingly the villain of the film, is actually the victim of racist violence by a lynch mob. The real villains are the middle and upper class academics, whose discrimination and condescension towards poor people in the community actually exacerbates their oppression. Terrifying and surprisingly nuanced, Candyman is a horror movie staple for any social justice advocate.\n\n1. Alien (1979)\n\nAlien is the most progressive horror film I\u2019ve ever seen, hands down. Ridley Scott\u2019s masterpiece features truckers and miners in space who get sent on a suicide mission by their corporate employers to retrieve a deadly alien. The most oppressed workers are African Americans and women and they\u2019re also the people who survive the longest. The film features Sigourney Weaver as Lieutenant Ellen Ripley, a strong female fighter who essentially organizes her co-workers to revolt against the company\u2019s plan to capture the titular alien. Set more than 100 years in the future, the concerns of the workers on board the Nostromo echo those of Wal-Mart cashiers, UPS part-timers and fast-food workers in the U.S. today - poverty wages, wage theft, and in the case of the Nostromo Crew, incredibly unsafe working conditions. Alien still holds up as a genuinely scary film, but the real draw for activists is its fairly explicit anti-capitalist, pro-worker message.",

        "text":"5 Things We Know On A Sunday \u2013 From What You Should Want From Politicians And What They Should Wear To Handwriting And Hot-Wings\n\n5 Things We Know On A Sunday\n\nBrought to you by Lifts West, our home away from home in Red River, New Mexico!\n\n  1. I realized recently that I no longer know how to write every letter in cursive. My writing has evolved into some sort of hieroglyph that future scholars will long debate its meaning. Sometimes, looking back at my own notes, I am that scholar.\n  2. The best way to find things you\u2019re not looking for is to look for something else. I\u2019ve already found several things today I didn\u2019t know I needed. Still haven\u2019t found what I started off for though. I think this may also be a U2 song.\n\n3. Top 3 Hot-Wing Sauce Flavors. 3. Traditional Buffalo Style Wing Sauce. 2. Bourbon Honey Mustard. 1. Any version of Mango-Habanero. Bonus: Bleu Cheese is the only acceptable dipping sauce .\n\n4. When I hear a politician or leader talking about \u201cunifying\u201d us or finding \u201ccommon ground\u201d, what I really hear is \u201cI want you to think like me and I don\u2019t want to have any dissent or disagreement\u201d. Politics is and always should be about sharp differences and disagreements. And that is OK. Personally, I don\u2019t want a politician I favor to compromise and embrace ideals that I\u2019ve rejected. I want that person to stand-up for those ideals and fight for them. Whatever it is you believe in, you should want and expect nothing less from the person you vote for.\n\n5. I think it would be awesome if politicians wore suits like NASCAR drivers and PGA golfers that have their sponsor logos all over them. When it comes to some of your local folks, there might be just a few names on those suits, but they\u2019d probably all be the same names for the elected officials. Plus, if they wore these suits, it would be cool when they get interviewed on local news and start thanking all their sponsors for a great council meeting and a fun tax-increase!\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.",

        "text":"Donald Trump\u2019s victories over the past two weeks have made it clear that he\u2019s the clear favorite for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nWho will he pick as his running mate? \u201cI just don\u2019t want to think about it right now,\u201d he said Tuesday. But everyone else is. Top prospects:\n\n\n5. Marco Rubio: Yes, there was that whole \u201cLittle Marco\u201d thing. But if Ben Carson can make peace with Trump, then anything can happen. Rubio is clearly in search of a next step in his political career, and it\u2019s hard to imagine him turning it down. Rubio could help Trump with outreach to establishment Republicans. As a Cuban-American, he also might be able to blunt some of Trump\u2019s sharpest edges on immigration.\n\n\n4. John Kasich: These two have been on (relatively) friendly terms throughout the race. Kasich would represent an olive branch from Trump to the establishment and might carry the sort of resume that would appeal to Trump. And no Republican has ever won the White House without carrying Ohio.\n\n\n3. Joni Ernst: The Iowa Republican senator emerged as a breakout star of the 2014 midterm election with her plain-spoken populism. If Trump wanted to make a turning-over-a-new-leaf pick, Ernst would make sense. She is a gifted communicator and someone who might help Trump sell to the Midwestern voter he needs to compete with Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n2. Rick Scott: The Florida governor wrote a Facebook post Wednesday urging the party to rally behind Trump. Scott has been consistently supportive of Trump for months. Scott\u2019s profile is also likely appealing to Trump \u2014 a wealthy businessman who ran and beat the Republican establishment to get elected governor. Plus, he\u2019s from a big swing state.\n\n\n1. Chris Christie: \u201cI think Chris Christie is fantastic,\u201d Trump said last Tuesday as the New Jersey governor stood just behind him on stage. No one has risked more with his support for Trump than Christie, who has been roundly mocked and dismissed by the GOP establishment for the decision. Personality-wise, Christie and Trump seem to be an obvious match. And, Trump has said that he would want a politician as his running mate.",

        "text":"A Social Prepper Network\n\nYour Rights (And Advice) For Voting on Election Day in the U.S.\n\nToday is a very political day for America. Passionate people for both parties are gearing up for an upset in either direction. Stores are boarding their windows in anticipation for riots. It\u2019s a dangerous time. But all the while, we still need to vote. Voting is how we get people WE want in charge.\u00a0\n\nNot everyone has faith in the voting system right now, though. If you\u2019re out at the voting booth, here are some important pieces of information to keep in mind. Follow these rules and pieces of advice and you should be able to get your vote counted.\n\n  1. You have to be 18 to vote. There have been reports of people being turned down, claiming they had to be 21. This is a lie and an attempt to prevent young voters from being counted. If you are 18 or older, you are old enough to vote. If someone tries to stop you, escalate to a supervisor or contact the voter protection service.\n  2. Don\u2019t wear political clothing. Some folks may be tempted to wear hats or shirts boasting their political preference. Some people are reporting that they are being rejected by polling places for political promotion within a voting ground. This is a more tricky legal thing and should be avoided all together.\n  3. If you are not registered to vote, a large number of states will allow you to register at the polling location. Look up if this applies to your state.\n  4. If you make a mistake on a ballot, you are entitled to ask for a new one.\n  5. If the ballot machines are down, you are entitled to a paper ballot.\n  6. Be sure to fill out the ballot bubbles completely and cleanly.\n  7. If you are still in line at a polling place and they hit closing hours, stay in line. They are required to process the remaining voters in line.\n  8. Leave other voters alone. Confrontation can be seen as voter intimidation, regardless of context.\n\nConcerned about your voter protections being infringed upon? You can call these numbers, which vary by state.\n\nvoter protection hotline numbers by state\n\nBe safe everyone. Your vote deserved to be recorded. That\u2019s what America was founded on, after all.\n\nSpread the love\n\nNext Post\n\nPrevious Post\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\u00a9 2020 Preps Life\n\nTheme by Anders Nor\u00e9n",

        "text":"Ron Paul Supporters Continue 2012 Revolution and the Weekend Top 4 Ron Paul Media Stories\n\nNow that the mainstream media seems to have taken notice of Ron Paul's revolution, stories about the libertarian champion seem to be popping up from news outlets every week.\u00a0\n\nHere's this weekend's recap with stories from a variety of oulets from Politico to the Houston Chronicle. After all, it seems the Revolution will be indeed televised.\u00a0\n\n1. Politico:\n\nTagline: \u201cRon Paul started what his supporters call a revolution. Now, that revolution is threatening to march on without him.\u201d\n\nThesis: \u201cIn what amounts to public pleading with his passionate supporters, Paul\u2019s campaign has made clear that he wants them to tamp down the rhetoric, and to be respectful of Mitt Romney at the national convention in August when Romney is crowned the GOP nominee. That isn\u2019t sitting well with some Paulites, who have made their anger clear on message boards and in videos over the past week.\u201d\n\n\nTagline:\u00a0\"Ron Paul\u2019s strategy is to control the GOP 'from the inside out.'\"\n\nThesis: \u201cFreshman state Rep. Kurt Bills, a Rosemount High School economics teacher, is widely considered the frontrunner in a three-way race for the Senate endorsement at the state Republican convention Friday. \u2018Although the situation is fluid, most people say Kurt Bills is the favorite because he has the support of the Ron Paul crowd, and they are going to play a major role at the convention.\u2019\"\u00a0\n\n3. Houston Chronicle:\n\nTagline: \"I hasten to add that Ron Paul's not running again (for Congress).\"\n\nThesis: \u201cWhen Republican congressional hopeful Randy Weber knocks on doors in Ron Paul's hometown and says he'd like to take \"Dr. No's\" place in Washington, he offers a caveat.\u00a0Weber, 58, is one of nine Republicans vying for the party's nomination in Paul's congressional district, which includes Lake Jackson, where the 76-year-old Paul delivered hundreds of babies as an obstetrician, sends out holiday cookbooks with his wife Carol, and goes jogging or biking along Oyster Creek Drive.\"\n\n4. NPR:\n\nTagline: \u201cIn the race for the Republican presidential nomination, only one candidate remains to challenge presumptive nominee Mitt Romney: Texas Rep. Ron Paul.\u201d\n\nThesis:\u00a0\"Even Paul has said he will no longer campaign in states that have yet to hold their primaries. And Paul has always been considered a long shot to win. But that hasn't deterred many of his hard-core supporters, including the Silicon Valley billionaire who has bankrolled the SuperPAC backing Paul.\u00a0Peter Thiel is a venture capitalist, entrepreneur and co-founder of PayPal. He hit the jackpot again when he gave Mark Zuckerberg the money to launch Facebook.\u00a0Thiel's half-million dollar Facebook investment is now worth more than $1 billion. His success and his smarts have made him a virtual rock star in Silicon Valley.\"",

Customers can also opt to use their card as a normal CHIP card and transact in a \u2018contact\u2019 mode too. Once the merchant enters the purchase amount in the contactless PoS terminal, the customer simply has to just wave the card on the terminal and the payment is processed wirelessly in a fast and secure manner.\n3. With the fast changing digital banking in the Indian market and RBI\u2019s recent guidelines of promoting PIN-less small ticket transactions, South Indian Bank believes that the contactless technology in cards will be the next big revolution in digital banking in the country.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nFollow us on",

        "text":"6 People We Can Trade in the 2016 Racial Draft\n\n\nWho\u2019s up for some trading? I am! Over the last year, a lot has happened. And the truth is, a lot of these unfortunate (AND fortunate) events have brought out a lot of people\u2019s true colors. Whether it be your Facebook friends, your real life friends, or your favorite celebrities, thanks to social media, we have access to EVERYBODY\u2019S thoughts on a regular basis\u2026and sometimes, that can be really annoying.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s annoyed me to no end is seeing some of my favorite Black celebrities make complete and utter fools out of themselves, turning their backs on the Black community, making comments on national TV and via Twitter that they really should reconsider. So I\u2019ve decided that there are 6 Black people that I\u2019d like to trade in exchange for 6 White folk. Here\u2019s who I\u2019ve chosen:\n\n1. First up in the racial draft is Stacey Dash-\n\nNow, I used to LOVE her back in the day. I always thought she was so beautiful. \u201cClueless\u201d was one of my favorite childhood movies. But NOW, nobody better say her name around ME, because she manages to piss me off every time she opens her mouth these days.\n\nDash\u2019s opinion on whether Obamacare has helped minorities-\u201cIt still keeps them stuck. They are getting money for free,\u201d Dash said. \u201cThey feel worthless. They are uneducated.\u201d\n\nAfter Paula Dean said \u201cnigger.\u201d \u2013 \u201cGod does everything for a reason @Paula_Deen Only God can judge your heart BTW my daughter loves your show (only way she can get me to cook).\u201d\n\nI mean, the girl REALLY IS \u201cClueless.\u201d Not to mention she wants Donald Trump to be President.\n\n2. Charles Barkley-\n\n\nWhen asked about why Black people are racially profiled- \u201cWe as black people, we got a lot of crooks.\u201d\n\n*Longest sigh ever* Mr. Barkley, I hate to break it to you, but every race of people has \u201ccrooks.\u201d Are they all targeted by police? No. Are they incarcerated in large numbers? No. Are they given harsher prison sentences than everybody else? No. Ever heard of \u201cwhite collar\u201d crime, Mr. Barkley? It\u2019s RAMPANT! Stick to dribbling balls.\n\n3. Don Lemon-\n\n\nOh Don. Girl, you stress me out! It\u2019s like your goal is for Black people to not take you seriously. You\u2019ve already been banned from all of our cookouts\u2026I don\u2019t know what else to say. Your respectability politics and lectures on the N word are not welcome. Also, NO the President shouldn\u2019t apologize for slavery!\n\n\n4. Raven-Symone&Whoopi Goldberg-\n\n\nFrom her sitdown with Oprah, where she claimed that she was neither gay or African-American, (she is) to her defending comments in which a Univision media personality likened Mrs. Obama to an ape, Raven hasn\u2019t been a favorite in the Black community for some time now. And at this point, I just look at these co-hosts as a two for one package. If it isn\u2019t Whoopi saying crazy shit, it\u2019s Raven. The View can\u2019t seem to find any sensible Black women to put on the panel. Below you can find Whoopi Goldberg defending Mel Gibson\u2019s anti-semitic rant a couple of years back.\n\nAnd to Raven: You don\u2019t wanna be \u201cAfrican-American\u201d? Your wish is granted. Bye girl!\n\n5.Herman Cain-\n\n\nCain is incapable of keeping his foot out of his mouth, telling Fox Business Channel\u2019s Varney & Co that 50 % Of Black Voters in Georgia a\u201dprobably are clueless\u201d and vote only on \u201cparty name and candidate.\u201d Ugh. I think this article pretty much sums it up. He reminds me of Clarence Thomas. Another reason why he can go. By the way, CT isn\u2019t on this list, because I think we all threw him out with the trash a long time ago. (Circa Anita Hill)\n\n\n\nCommon used to be my bae in my head\u2026until this\u2013\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve been bullied, we\u2019ve been beat down and we don\u2019t want it anymore. We are not extending a fist and we are not saying, \u2018You did us wrong.\u2019 It\u2019s more like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m extending my hand in love,\u2019\u201d he said to host Jon Stewart. \u201cLet\u2019s forget about the past as much as we can and let\u2019s move from where we are now. How can we help each other? Can you try to help us because we are going to try to help ourselves, too.\u201d\n\n\nNah. Common, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. extended his hand in love. Didn\u2019t work. Got it? What NEEDS to happen, is people need to take some accountability, and make some changes. Only THEN can we move forward.\n\n*Honorable Mention\u2013\n\nDylann Roof\u2019s \u201cBlack Friend\u201d\n\nNow that you guys are officially out of the club, here\u2019s who we\u2019ll take:\n\n1.Joe Biden-\n\n\nUncle Joe! You ol\u2019 rascal you! Talk about a ride or die friend. Listen, NOBODY BETTER SAY NOTHIN\u2019 BAD ABOUT UNCLE JOE!\n\n2.Jon Stewart-\n\nNever biting his tongue. Always delivering the real. Using his platform to speak truth to power.\n\n3.J.K. Rowling-\n\nThat\u2019s essentially all I needed. Come on in, and have seat, girl.\n\n4.Khloe Kardashian\n\n\nI know the Kardashians have had a hard way to go. We often give them a lot of shit. BUT, I absolutely LOVE Khloe. And if homegirl wants to be down, we\u2019ll let her. I think we can all agree that she\u2019s our favorite.\n\n5.Bill Clinton-\n\nThis ol\u2019 saxophone playing former President has stolen our hearts on more than one occasion, and as President of the Black people coalition, I vote that Bill Clinton will always have a special place in our hearts.\n\n\n6.Robin Thicke-\n\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty clear that we\u2019ve accepted Robin Thicke as one of us. He was at the BET awards this year, now he\u2019s on the Steve Harvey music lineup\u2026I mean, he\u2019s a part of the family. Heeey Robin.\n\n*Honorable Mention\n\nTeena Marie\n\n\nAll hail the Queen! God rest her soul. This is one of our favorite women to date! Nobody rocked us like Miss Teena, and she is surely missed. If you can hang with Rick, you damn sure can hang with us!\n\nSo who would you put up in the 2016 racial draft? Who\u2019s got to go??\n\n\n\n\nOne thought on \u201c6 People We Can Trade in the 2016 Racial Draft\n\n  1. I was riding with u untili saw Bill Clinton. Fact check the delete. So many Black.and Hispanic Men and Women are doing life because of him. Pls take him off the list. And if you don\u2019t then you must place your name on that racial draft list too. Thank you!\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

        "text":"From left: Karl Rove, Michael Bloomberg and Gabrielle Giffords are pictured in this composite. | AP Photos\n\nRove, Bloomberg and Giffords are likely to play a major role in the 2014 political agenda. | AP Photos\n\nWallets to watch in 2014 races\n\nBillionaires, super PACs and nonprofits are gearing up for another round of intraparty fighting that will shape the direction of their respective parties for years to come.\n\nOn the Republican side, the business wing of the GOP establishment has declared war on elements of the party\u2019s base \u2014 convinced that the religious right\u2019s focus on social issues is costing swing votes and that tea partiers are playing a dangerous game of chicken with the U.S. economy. Those conservative activists, on the other hand, are determined to rid their party of the moderates and compromisers who they say are empowering President Barack Obama and standing in the way of meaningful conservative reform.\n\nDemocrats \u2014 less prone recently to pitched battles about the direction of the party in the age of Obama \u2014 are also showing early signs of a growing split over the future of the party.\n\n( PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014)\n\nProgressives and left-leaning activists are already clamoring for alternatives to the centrist, pro-business (read: Hillary Clinton) wing of the party \u2014 embodied by Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rise to prominence as a darling of the left. Meanwhile, on two hot-button issues \u2014 climate and gun control \u2014 activist mega-donors are determined to punish Democrats deemed insufficiently committed to the party\u2019s stated agenda on both issues.\n\nHere are 10 people and groups that are poised to play a major role in primaries or setting the political agenda in 2014:\n\n1) Karl Rove\u2019s Crossroads networks\n\nIn 2014, strategist Karl Rove\u2019s mission is to save the GOP from fiscal and cultural hardliners.\n\nConvinced that the purity demanded by conservative activists has cost the party a half-dozen Senate seats in 2010 and 2012, Rove has added a new super PAC to his Crossroads network.\n\nHis new Conservative Victory Project super PAC is aimed at backing the most conservative, electable candidates \u2014 helping provide a counterweight to tea party zeal and avoid duds like 2010 Delaware candidate Christine O\u2019Donnell or 2012 Missouri candidate Todd Akin.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: 10 critical Senate races in 2014)\n\nThough the new group didn\u2019t raise any money in the first half of 2013 \u2014 something that the group has chalked up in previous interviews to a certain level of donor fatigue \u2014 Rove still has a massive donor network of influential conservatives who largely hail from the business community.\n\n2) Michael Bloomberg\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has never been shy about using his wealth to advance his agenda. In 2013, his two pro-gun-control efforts \u2014 the super PAC Independence USA and Mayors Against Illegal Guns \u2014 spent millions against opponents of stricter gun regulation.\n\nThey\u2019re poised to play a similar role in 2014 \u2014 despite the gun control agenda virtually disappearing after a failed Senate vote last year on background check legislation and a Congress more fearful of the power of the National Rifle Association than the pro-gun control lobby.\n\nIndependence USA put $2.2 million backing Robin Kelly over former Rep. Debbie Halvorson in a special election for an Illinois congressional seat. Halvorson had earned an A rating from the NRA during her time in Congress \u2014 but the NRA did nothing to help her. In an October interview, Bloomberg also vowed to defeat Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) \u2014 a vulnerable Democrat in a deep red state \u2014 for his 2013 vote on the background check bill.\n\n3) American Principles\n\nThis outfit \u2014 comprised of a pair of nonprofits and a super PAC \u2014 is the advance guard of a planned big-money effort by the religious right to push back on establishment efforts to minimize divisive issues like abortion rights and gay marriage.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: 10 must-watch House races)\n\nTo do that, social conservatives concede, they need to raise more money for aggressive outside spending, including in primaries. American Principles started a super PAC in May and spent $173,000 in October on ads attacking Democrat Cory Booker as a \u201c pro-abortion extremist\u201d and Republican Liz Cheney as a gay rights supporter.\n\nThe success of the ads hitting Cheney in the Wyoming Republican Senate primary should help the group raise more money to air ads elevating social issues in more raises, said its leading donor, New Jersey hedge funder Sean Fieler.\n\n\u201cYou need races and candidates and states that allow you to frame this in a way that other politicians are willing to emulate,\u201d said Fieler, asserting that primaries present an appealing target for his group and others in the social conservative movement. \u201cParticipating in the primaries is more complicated for Party establishment donors and entities than it is for me.\u201d\n\n4) Club for Growth\n\nThe Club For Growth has long played in Republican primary battles \u2014 helping to boost a little-known Texan named Ted Cruz against the establishment favorite David Dewhurst in 2012, for example. In 2014, the Club has made five endorsements so far.\n\n( PHOTOS: Governors\u2019 offices up for grabs in 2014)\n\nIt\u2019s backed Justin Amash and Bryan Smith in House races in Michigan and Idaho, respectively. And it threw its support behind Senate candidates Ben Sasse in Nebraska, Chris McDaniel in Mississippi and Tom Cotton in Arkansas.\n\nSpokesman Barney Keller said the group\u2019s 2014 strategy is the same as always: It\u2019ll bundle contributions for candidates from supportive donors across the country and get involved with independent expenditures, if necessary.\n\n5) Tom Steyer\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer has emerged as the top voice on climate change in Democratic circles.\n\nHe\u2019s ramped up the pressure on Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline, warning the administration to reject it or face a rebellion from Democratic donors. His super PAC, the NextGen Committee, has been active in several off-cycle 2013 races and is poised to play a bigger role in 2014 in both party primaries and the general election.\n\nAlready, the super PAC backed Rep. Ed Markey in the 2013 Massachusetts Senate race over Rep. Stephen Lynch. The PAC also poured more than $8 million into the Virginia gubernatorial race to make an example of Republican Ken Cuccinelli.\n\nA spokesperson said no decisions have been made which 2014 races to target \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that Steyer is willing to intervene in primaries and general elections alike to change the political calculus on energy politics.",

        "text":"Now that we've experienced blanket coverage of the death of Osama bin Laden, here's a rundown of who gained the most from a media perspective.\n\nBarack Obama and the White House Communications Team\n\nThe president had a great story to tell, and he and his team revealed the heroic mission with perfect modulation.\u00a0 From the first tweet alerting the press corps and priming the media nation for big news to come, Team Obama showed a command of social media not seen since its successful 2008 campaign. With President Obama\u2019s first speech to the nation and the calculated briefings that followed, unwinding an action narrative worthy of a John Clancy novel, the White House got maximum boost and so far has avoided any \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d missteps.\n\n\nGiven the dramatic cascade effect that followed the tweet from former Donald Rumsfeld aide Keith Urbahn, which was first to report bin Laden\u2019s demise, nobody need question the value of 140 characters or less anymore. \u00a0Twitter had the biggest night in its five-year history on Sunday, recording 3,000 tweets per second. \u00a0Daily news outfits used to publish the first draft of history; now Twitter\u2019s hundreds of millions of users are drafting it in real time\u2014not least of whom is Sohaib Athar, the bin Laden neighbor who tweeted about inexplicable noise and loss of power in Abbottabad the night of the Navy SEALS\u2019s visit. (In an interview with the conservative website, Athar revealed that he doesn\u2019t own a TV set.) And new platforms like Storify, which automatically compiles social-media feeds into narrative forms, are advancing the evolution of how news stories can be created.\n\nLegacy Media\n\nWhile Twitter and other social media platforms may be compiling the first draft of history, blue chip news organizations like The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are still the ones packaging it up expertly with background and context.\u00a0 Other news organizations, widely available in the digital world, such as the BBC, The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph, have aggressively reported the story from a more global perspective. Taking full advantage of social media tools at hand, they are crowdsourcing news, encouraging comments from readers, and doing great work to keep us informed and engaged.\n\nAl Jazeera\n\nThe Qatar-based news organization continues to build on its success from its much lauded coverage of the upheaval that\u2019s been engulfing the Middle East since the uprisings began in Tunisia and Egypt. \u00a0Al Jazeera English is now a go-to destination online for breaking news from the region, much as we flip to CNN when a tornado or hurricane hits closer to home. (As for the domestic cable news competition, CNN handily bested Fox News and MSNBC on Sunday night.)\n\nConservative Columnists\n\nRush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity may have had trouble giving the president his due, but a raft of conservative columnists heaped praise on the administration that couldn\u2019t have been more positive had it been written by Michelle Obama.\u00a0 Those pundits from the right who called it as they saw it, praising a president who is usually a target for editorial abuse, added to the credibility of their brands. For example, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s opinion pages could have been mistaken for the New York Times's. \u00a0A headline for WSJ columnist Bret Stephens read \u201cObama\u2019s Finest Hour.\u201d\u00a0 On that same page, William McGurn wrote that the Obama\u2019s mastery of the mission was a challenge to Republicans to put forth a coherent foreign policy.\u00a0 \u201cGoing after bin Laden as forcefully as he did, Mr. Obama undermines one of the primary narratives against him\u2014that of an indecisive president who worries more about the rights of our enemies than the freedom and safety of our citizens.\u201d In short, see Winner #1 above.\n\nTo read more by J.

        "text":"The Critical Dozen - The Dozen Things President Zuma Must Do\n\nThere are a dozen critical things that President Zuma must personally attend to during the remaining four years of his presidency to ensure a legacy of admiration and respect.\n\nThe country is sliding into a muddle of belligerent activism that must be quelled otherwise we will soon see public protests becoming waves of violent revolt, flames and ruin. The youth especially, is under threat of being usurped by revolutionaries and opportunists. The twelve actions must be undertaken promptly and coherently to produce and broadcast the positive resonance that will galvanize and save the nation from ruin. The actions will stop the slide into misery and will build a legacy of safety, unity, enterprise and prosperity for which the president will be remembered.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Publicly demand zero tolerance for poor public service delivery. Demanding and measuring performance excellence on a task and project basis, will change behaviour and citizens will soon experience the positive effects of efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Appoint senior executives in the public service on the basis of proficiency and proven excellence. Ensure that the qualifications of all public officials are valid and that promotions are based on sterling accomplishments.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ban public demonstrations in public roads, barricading of roads and burning of tyres and buildings. Create a public service delivery grievance resolution procedure involving the media, which results in immediate investigations and corrections.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compensate and reward teachers for tuition excellence and youth development. Institute a process that ensures our school education system and teacher compensation structure is on par with the best in the world.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Make high school education free. Reduce the high school drop-out rate and youth substance abuse by increasing funding to public schools to cover school fees, cost of uniforms and sport, nourishment and transport.\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Implement a strategy to make our soccer internationally competitive and popular. Make soccer the first choice official school sport and establish at least one soccer academy for talented players in every town with a sizable young people population.\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Launch a patriotism building drive and secure a national patriotic bond between all black, coloured and white South Africans. Put in place an Apartheid forgiveness and reconciliation process that unifies all races in shared patriotism.\n\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reward small enterprise owners for successful employment, on-job training and retention of young people. Reduce the funding for employee training going to state education and training agencies and channel the funds to entrepreneurs on the basis of fixed employment and job-creation performance history and value-added on-job training.\n\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Put the police force through social virtues and moral values training. Ensure that every police officer undergoes training in the root causes of crime and violence and the effects of substance abuse, crime, violence, virtues and values on human behaviour.\n\n10.\u00a0\u00a0 Turn prisons for non-lifers into craft training centres. Establish a craft training centre in every prison and train those prisoners who are incarcerated for more than one year, but less than five years, in a craft and set of skills that will ensure employability on release.\n\n11.\u00a0\u00a0 Prohibit the building of shacks and un-serviced settlements for the poor and authorise regional municipal councils to build decent housing and infrastructure on suitable vacant ground owned by the state.\n\n12.\u00a0\u00a0 Shield and protect the President against political and media attacks that harm his reputation and dignity and give rise to citizen shame, hopelessness and interracial ill-will in communities. Find a way to get rid of the ills and wrongs of the past and a way to engage and build the future with confidence.\n\nThe mental, emotional and spiritual influence in our society of doing and succeeding with the above critical dozen will generate the hope, enthusiasm and resolve that is needed to turn South Africa into a winning nation within four years. The President\u2019s tolerant nature and charismatic style of leadership will ensure that he will succeed with the above and all South Africans will benefit.\n\nMartin Jansen 2014-08-21 04:25:22 PM\nA dozen things will take him years. Just do one simple thing; go play in the traffic.\nMargaret Cox 2014-08-21 05:51:27 PM\nAnd do you think Zuma gives a toss about anything that doesn't bother him personally?",

        "text":"Newsone PolitickerOne\n\n\nNewsOne\u2019s PolitickerOne blog tackles some of the most important topics in politics: Election 2016, moves by the Obama administration, voting rights, lawmaking, and the way that elected officials represent our communities. Three times a week, we will\u00a0go beyond the mainstream media\u2019s \u201cpack\u201d coverage of politics to highlight the underreported aspects of how politics and policy affect you and the people you care about. In between, follow the conversation on Twitter at #PolitickerOne.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the youth vote helped propel President Barack Obama into office during his historic election in 2008, and again in 2012.\n\nHe garnered 60 percent of the vote among those younger than 30 in his re-election, according to Pew Research Center. Those numbers were down from 2008, when he won nearly two-thirds, or 66 percent of the votes among young people.\n\nStill, support from young voters may have played a bigger role in his second victory than in the first win. Why? Well, the under 30 demographic in 2012 was \u201cby far the most racially and ethnically diverse age group,\u201d the report says, and the president keyed into issues of great concern and urgency to them, including health care, immigration reform, and same-sex marriage.\n\nNow in 2015, the young voting bloc has not changed much and neither have the issues of importance to them, which is why the Republican Party is failing to draw in the millennial voters it needs to be successful in the 2016 general election, according to The Brookings Institution.\n\nDespite hauling in a record number of older viewers for its last GOP debate on CNN, the Brookings Institution said millennials were likely to view the event as a free-for-all \u201cwhere cultures and generations clash.\u201d The campaign rhetoric also flies in the face of this generation\u2019s beliefs and views.\n\nHere are six top reasons millennials are not tuning in to 2016 presidential candidates:\n\n1. Black Lives Matter\n\nBlack Lives Matter\n\nDespite having Ben Carson, the sole Black presidential hopeful this election cycle, the Republican Party ignored\u00a0#BlackLivesMatter, the most powerful movement to emerge since the civil rights era, during its second presidential debate last week at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California.\n\nPolitickerOne noted in August that \u201cWhite privilege was on full display\u201d at the group\u2019s first debate in Cleveland, Ohio, which occurred on the same day as the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nNone of the candidates or debate host Fox News mentioned the landmark law that prohibits racial discrimination in voting.\n\n2. Immigration Reform\n\nCarson. Walker, Trump at GOP August 2015 Debate\n\nMost of the Republican candidates hold stances on immigration reform that are untenable for millennials, who are, ahem, mostly immigrants, and who have been repeatedly targeted \u2013 chiefly by Donald Trump. With immigration adding more numbers to its generation than any other, millennials are projected to peak in 2036 at 81.1 million, according to Pew Research Center:\n\nThe Census Bureau projects that the Millennial population was 74.8 million in 2014. By 2015 Millennials will increase in size to 75.3 million and become the biggest group.\n\n3. Same-Sex Marriage\n\nHigh angle view of two female symbols drawn on the road with a heart shape\n\nAn estimated 70 percent of millennials support same-sex marriage, while it\u2019s not discussed at all among some Republican candidates. Former Arkansas Gov. and\u00a0Republican presidential hopeful\u00a0Mike Huckabee\u00a0made a splash over his support of Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who received national attention and\u00a0went to jail for violating a federal order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\nBut not all Republican presidential candidates sided with Davis. MSNBC News\u00a0reports Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina,\u00a0and Trump said she had \u201can obligation to perform her duties as an elected county clerk, which include issuing marriage licenses.\u201d\n\n4. Millennials Support Obamacare\n\nBarack Obama & Joe Biden\n\nWhile most Republican presidential candidates talk about repealing the popular Affordable Care Act, the formal name for Obamacare, Brookings notes that \u201c52 percent of millennials approve of the program.\u201d Enough said.\n\n5. Millennials Favor Legalization of Marijuana\n\nMetropolitan Police and Federal Partners Seize $7.1 Million in Drugs Operation.\n\nAbout 68 percent of millennials support legalizing marijuana, but few Republican candidates have come out in support of it, notes Brookings:\n\nRand Paul\u2019s insistence on a state\u2019s rights approach to (medical) legalization choices was as close as the field came. Instead, Jeb Bush in the best Boomer presidential candidate tradition apologized for using the stuff when he was young, chalking it up to youthful indiscretion, and Governor Chris Christie asserted that maintaining pot\u2019s illegality was so important as President he would go against traditional Republican deference to state\u2019s rights and assert federal law supremacy over state law to prosecute offenders.\n\n6. Millennials Are Concerned About Climate Change\n\nGlobal warming, climate change, iceberg,\n\nClimate change, an important issue to millennials, has been showing up on the presidential campaign trail among Democrats, but barely registers among Republicans, as NewsOne reported earlier. For example, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told Face the Nation that \u201chuman activity has nothing to do with climate change,\u201d while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u201chas made it clear he doesn\u2019t believe in climate change, but also says he isn\u2019t a \u2018denier.'\u201d\n\nAre there other reasons millennials are not tuning in to Republican presidential candidates?

Thank you for subscribing!\n\n\nClinton and Trump head into Super Tuesday with big leads\n\nThe presidential frontrunners, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, head into the March 1 Super Tuesday primaries with big leads over their rivals. Clinton leads Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont 55 percent to 38 percent in a CNN\/ORC poll released Monday. Trump had the support of 49 percent of Republican and GOP-leaning voters nationally, widening his already huge lead over his nearest rival, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, to 30 percentage points. Establishment Republicans fear that if Trump dominates the states voting Tuesday, as expected, his march to the nomination will be unstoppable. [CNN, Bloomberg]\n\n\nNavy SEAL receives Medal of Honor for rescue mission\n\nPresident Obama awarded the Medal of Honor on Monday to Navy SEAL Edward Byers for his role in the rescue of an American doctor who was being held as a hostage in Afghanistan. Byers, 36, used his own body to shield the doctor, Dilip Joseph, during a firefight. Byers was the 11th living service member to receive the military's highest honor for valor for actions in Afghanistan. [Reuters]\n\n\nHecklers disrupt Trump rally in Virginia\n\nHecklers, some belonging to the Black Lives Matter movement, disrupted a Donald Trump rally in Virginia on Monday. Trump said, \"Are you from Mexico?\" and supporters chanted, \"All lives matter,\" as dozens of black protesters were being escorted out. A Time magazine photographer who stepped out of the press pen to photograph the protesters was choked and pushed to the ground by a Secret Service agent. The fracas came a day after Trump was swamped with criticism for failing to clearly repudiate white supremacists' support. [Time, Reuters]\n\n\nLast set of Hillary Clinton's emails released\n\nThe State Department on Monday released the last batch of Hillary Clinton's 30,000 emails from a private server she used while serving as President Obama's secretary of state. The final set of about 1,700 emails included 23 retroactively deemed \"Secret,\" bringing the total under that classification to 65. There were no new messages withheld as \"Top Secret,\" the most sensitive classification, although spy agencies had pushed for the designation on a message regarding North Korean ballistic missile testing. Clinton and her aides have disputed the \"Top Secret\" designations, noting the messages were not deemed classified when they were sent. [Politico, The New York Times]\n\n\nTeen charged with shooting two students at Ohio school\n\nPolice arrested a 14-year-old male student for allegedly shooting two other teen students in the cafeteria of a Butler County, Ohio, school on Monday. The suspect was identified as James Austin Hancock. He was charged with two counts of attempted murder, as well as assault, inducing panic, and making terroristic threats. The victims were in stable condition and their wounds were not life-threatening. Two other students were injured by shrapnel. [Cincinnati Enquirer]\n\n\nJudge says Apple can't be forced to unlock iPhone in drug case\n\nA federal judge in New York on Monday rejected a request by the federal government to force Apple to unlock an iPhone in a drug case. The ruling involves a phone seized by DEA agents in a drug trafficking investigation, and is unrelated to Apple's fight against the FBI's effort to make Apple help hack into an iPhone used by one of the killers in the San Bernardino massacre. [Engadget]\n\n\nJustice Thomas speaks during oral arguments\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas spoke from the bench on Monday, asking a question for the first time in 10 years. The case involves a federal law depriving people convicted of domestic violence of the right to own guns. Thomas asked Justice Department lawyer Ilana Eisenstein if there are any other instances where law-breakers can have a constitutional right suspended, setting off a discussion that lasted several minutes. [Chicago Tribune]\n\n\nMigrants protest effort to dismantle part of Calais camp\n\nMigrants clashed with French riot police on Monday at a makeshift refugee village known as the Jungle, as bulldozers moved in to raze some of the shanties in the camp. Some of the shacks were set on fire, and about 150 refugees threw stones at police and vehicles. About 3,700 people live in the camp, and as many as 1,000 stand to be evicted as the French government tries to move them. Many are hoping to travel from Calais to the U.K. [RFI]\n\n\nActor George Kennedy dies at 91\n\nActor George Kennedy, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for Cool Hand Luke in 1968, died Sunday from a heart condition, an Idaho coroner confirmed Monday. He was 91. Kennedy's health had reportedly been failing since his wife's death a year ago and he had been in hospice care for a month. The burly actor also was known for his roles in The Dirty Dozen, the Airport movies, The Naked Gun, and the CBS drama Dallas. [The Wrap]\n\n\nOscars draw third lowest ratings ever\n\nThe 2016 Academy Awards telecast, hosted by comedian Chris Rock, drew 34.3 million viewers, the third lowest ratings since Nielsen started tracking viewership in the mid-1970s. The preliminary ratings figures, reported Monday, were down 6 percent from the 2015 ceremony, and the lowest in eight years. Industry analysts said several factors were at play, including a lack of box-office hits among best-picture nominees and the possibility that some viewers tuned out due to the lack of non-white acting nominees.

        "text":"Skip to main content\nReport this ad\n\nSee also:\n\nIs a two-state solution wrong-headed?\n\nDiscussing a two-state solution is premature.\n\nWhy the ceasefire?\nEzz Al-Zanoun\/Anadolu Agency\/Getty Images\n\nFox News reports an AP story this evening that Secretary of State John Kerry is calling for \u201cfresh Middle East\u201d peace talks. Here is a list of odd things about this approach:\n\n1. They are called the \u201cMiddle East\u201d peace talks.\n\nThey should be talking about Israel and Gaza peace talks. Why bring in the West Bank? A fresh approach would be for Israel to deal with one community at a time. Israel can attend to the issues that Gaza people have expressed such as having a sustainable economy and a safe environment. Those two things are within reach between the parties.\n\n2. Kerry wants a \u201cbigger and broader\u201d approach.\n\nTaking events a step at a time with a focus on specific needs is likely to be better than a lofty and grand approach. Get something done in increments. If Kerry and the U.S. want to discuss the Middle East in total, that is a much larger event than settling the Israelis and Palestinian issue.\n\n3. Kerry is still stuck on negotiating with Hamas, a terrorist organization that has taken over Gaza via its citizenry.\n\nBecause elections were employed to establish Hamas as a political entity, Jimmy Carter has it correct, they must be dealt with. First and foremost, if Hamas is to be treated as a political entity charged by the Gaza people to manage the territory, then there must be some requirements that differentiate them from being a terrorist organization.\n\nThe principal place to begin is for Israel, Gaza people, and Arab nation participants to determine what is the status of Hamas as a governing organization? Should it be armed, as in having an armed police department? Should it have military arms beyond that?\n\nFirst things first. President Obama may want to consider changing out Kerry and putting Joe Biden on point.\n\n\u201cKerry calls for fresh Middle East peace talks as Cairo mediation gets under way\nPublished August 06, 2014\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has called on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to use the ongoing 72-hour truce that halted fighting in the Gaza Strip as a stepping-stone to restart more far-reaching negotiations.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Kerry said that both sides needed to make a \"bigger, broader approach to the underlying solution of two states,\" adding, \"I believe that the situation now that has evolved will concentrate people's minds on the need to get back to the negotiations and try and resolve the issues.\"\n\nKerry spoke on the second day of the truce, which came into effect Tuesday morning and was precipitated by Israel's withdrawal of all ground forces from Gaza. Israeli troops had begun their ground offensive July 17, nine days after the commencement of airstrikes against Hamas rocket sites as part of Operation Protective Edge. Israel said it had destroyed 32 cross-border tunnels used by Hamas to attack Israeli soldiers and civilians.\n\nIn the BBC interview, Kerry said that Israel had a right to defend itself against rocket attacks from Gaza, saying, \"No country can live with that condition and the United States stands squarely behind Israel's right to defend itself in those circumstances. Period.\"\"\n\n(Read the rest at the link.)\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\u201d\n\nReport this ad",

        "text":"5 reasons why the Trudeau government should protect #EveryLakeEveryRiver\n\nEmma Lui\n3 years ago\n\nThe Trudeau government is poised to carry on the Harper government\u2019s harmful legacy on water and leave 99% of lakes and rivers unprotected in Canada.\n\nIn March, the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities released a report recommending that the Trudeau government leave the 99% of lakes and rivers unprotected under the Navigation Protection Act (NPA), formerly the Navigable Waters Protection Act (NWPA). The Trudeau government has until July 21, 2017 to respond but it could issue a response any day, which means we have limited time to act.\n\nIt us up to all of us to send a strong message to Members of Parliament that the Standing Committee recommendations are not enough to safeguard water and that all lakes and rivers must be protected. We encourage you to email, call or set up a meeting with your Member of Parliament to urge that the Trudeau government go well beyond the Standing Committee\u2019s recommendations by restoring and enhancing the NWPA. Be sure to take a photo if you meet your Member of Parliament and send it to webmaster@canadians.org.\n\nHere are five key points to make when you talk to your Member of Parliament, friends, family or neighbours or local media about the importance of protecting every lake and every river.\n\n1. 99% of lakes and rivers are unprotected\n\nRight now 99% of lakes and rivers are unprotected under the NPA. This means that dam, mining, logging, fish farm and other projects on unprotected waterways are moving forward without assessment of how they affect lakes, rivers and people\u2019s right to navigate waterways. Talk to your Member of Parliament about how important it is to protect every lake and every river. Communities use lakes and rivers for fishing, paddling, boating, recreation and tourism.\n\nCheck the short Schedule of protected waterways\u00a0to see if your local lake or river is protected. If it\u2019s not on the list, it\u2019s not protected. Tell your Member of Parliament how you, your family and your community use your local lake or river and that you want protections restored and enhanced under the NWPA.To learn more about how the NWPA can be enhanced, click here.\n\n2. Restoring water protections was one of Trudeau\u2019s election promises\n\nThe federal Liberal\u2019s 2015 platform promised voters that they would restore and strengthen freshwater protections. Their platform said, \u201cStephen Harper\u2019s changes to the Fisheries Act, and his elimination of the Navigable Waters Protection Act, have weakened environmental protections. We will review these changes, restore lost protections, and incorporate more modern safeguards.\u201d People from coast to coast voted for the real change that the Liberals had promised. If you have a Liberal MP, remind them about their promise to restore lost water protections like those under the NWPA.\n\n3. Communities want all lakes and rivers protected\n\nIn February, the Council of Canadians delivered 10,000 signed petitions calling on the Trudeau government to restore and enhance the NWPA. The petition called for all lakes, rivers and waterways to be fully protected; for the government to incorporate the obligation to obtain free, prior and informed consent as required by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into the NWPA; and implementation of strict safeguards for waterways to uphold the United Nations-recognized human right to water and sanitation.\n\nMore than 250 submissions were made to the Standing Committee on Transport including dozens of submissions from First Nations and Indigenous organizations like the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs as well as organizations like Ecojustice, Lake Ontario Waterkeepers, Wilderness Canoe Association and West Coast Environmental Law. Many submissions called for respect for Indigenous title and rights and for protections to be restored and enhanced.\n\n4. Pipelines and other projects are threatening lakes and rivers\n\nIn 2012, the former Harper government removed \u00a0federal scrutiny of large pipelines and powerlines under the NWPA. The Standing Committee recommends that Transport Canada be included in the decision-making on environmental assessments for pipelines and power lines that cross navigable waters. It is unclear what this means and whether reviews will be conducted for all waterways. Ask your Member of Parliament for clarification.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s government has already given the green light to tar sands pipelines such as Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain and Enbridge\u2019s Line 3 as well TransCanada\u2019s NOVA Gas pipeline, which will transport fracked gas from northeastern B.C. to Alberta. The Kinder Morgan pipeline crosses 1,309 waterways in B.C. and Alberta, many of which are not on the Schedule of protected waterways. Tell your Member of Parliament about your concerns about how pipeline or other projects will affect local waterways.\n\n5. Navigation, clean water and the environment are linked\n\nThere is an intimate link between navigation, clean waterways and environmental protection. Ecojustice has pointed out, \u201cThe interrelationship between navigation and the environment is such that the protection of the former consistently promotes the health of the latter.\u201d\n\nThe 2010 oil spill in the Kalamazoo River in Michigan polluted local waterways and affected navigation. The Enbridge spill leaked thick tar-like substance into the river for 17 hours before the pipeline was shut down. More than $1 billion was spent on cleanup, which continues to this day. After the spill, sections of the river and Morrow Lake remained closed to recreational use and boating for nearly two years. Sections of the river also remained closed for dredging operations to retrieve some of the submerged diluted bitumen more than three years after the spill. Talk to your Member of Parliament about how clean waterways are needed for navigation (paddling, transportation or fishing) and how they link to clean drinking water and a healthy environment.\n\nAt the same time that the Standing Committee made their weak recommendations in March, New Zealand granted the Whanguanui River the same legal rights as a human being.\u00a0Days later, India legally recognized the Yamuna and Ganges rivers as \"living entities.\" These historic decisions are what are needed to protect lakes and rivers.\n\nThere is nothing more important than clean water. We must urge Members of Parliament to put protections back on every lake and every river and work towards the bold visions that countries like New Zealand and India are carrying out in order to truly protect the world\u2019s lakes and rivers.\n\nCheck out the following resources to prepare yourself for your meeting with your Member of Parliament:\n\nLearn more about our #EveryLakeEveryRiver campaign\n\nGet updates\n\nJoin over 150,000 people working to promote democracy and justice.\n\nYou will receive email updates, event invitations, opportunities to help fund initiatives and other communications from the Council of Canadians.
