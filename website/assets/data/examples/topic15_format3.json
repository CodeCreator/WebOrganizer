        "text":"Maintain or reinvest in a corona treater? What's a converter to do?\n\nCan you afford to maintain your old surface treater?\n\nYour organization has probably seen its share of recent downsizing. And your resources are spread about as thin as can be. As you look to do more with less it can be a difficult time to justify an investment in new equipment. But how much is that old equipment really costing you? And how smart are you when it comes time to make repairs?\n\nConsider the cost of downtime. What does it cost you to have your production line down for 1 hour? How about for 8 hours? The dollars add up in a hurry.\n\nWell you're not alone. Many companies are trying to be more self-reliant with less staff and older equipment. In fact, Enercon's service department helps companies like yours out of jams on a regular basis. Our service team is receiving more calls than usual as more companies are trying to \"get-by\" with older systems.\n\nWe recently had a customer ask us why his treater would be operating intermittently. (The most difficult problems to solve are ones that aren't consistent.) It turns out that the customer had replaced some old parts, and in the process disconnected some of the system's electrical wiring.\n\nWhen they reattached the wires they failed to firmly attach the wires and unknowingly allowed the high voltage wire to rest in a position that resulted in severe arcing.\n\nEnercon Resources\n\nFortunately Enercon customers have significant resources available to them to avoid these situations. You can visit our website for troubleshooting information or talk to a service expert who can often solve a problem over a phone line. We've maintained our incredible depth of service resources while many of our own customers have been downsizing.\n\nHere's a quick tip you should definitely use. Buy yourself a digital camera. For $200 you can buy one of reasonable quality. The next time you have a problem take a photo and e-mail it to your supplier. A picture truly is worth a thousand words.\n\nTo buy or reinvest?\n\nSooner or later you'll have to make that tough decision on your aging treater. Should you put more money into it or look at an investment in a new one? Should your team tackle the problem or should you call in the experts?\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n  \u2022 Can your team handle the repair work?\n  \u2022 Does your team have time to do the work?\n  \u2022 Will a new treater allow you to run faster?\n  \u2022 Will a new treater allow you to run a wider range of substrates?\n\"Your old treater may have originally been manufactured for a different application... ...a new treater specifically designed for your application can improve productivity\"\n\nSigns you need a replacement\n\nLet's start with an obvious one; if your power supply is too old to get parts for it, it's time to replace it. If you can hear your power supply running it means it's time to replace it. If the wires in your power supply are hand wired, it's time to replace it.\n\nIf you're experiencing repeated component failures it might be time to replace the system. If you can't get the same dyne level you once could, it might be time to replace the system.\n\nThat last one brings up an interesting point. It's entirely possible that the treater you're using was originally manufactured for a different application. In fact, you might not even be running the original substrate any more. In this case a new treater specifically designed for your application can improve productivity.\n\nUsed or new\n\nOf course a new treater doesn't have to be brand new, just new to you. But finding a bargain is risky. Customers will call to ask about treaters they've found on the internet and in many cases the systems are outdated and usually sold \"as is.\"\n\nIf you are considering a replacement system be sure to define the scope of your application. Our talented engineering team can prepare a proposal for your specific requirements. I think you might be surprised at how affordable a new treater can be when it is custom designed just for you.\n\nAs always we provide honest advice for free, so please call us the next time you're considering a new or used piece of equipment. We'll offer our opinion and any historical information we might have on the system you're looking at. We can also provide a competitive proposal so you can accurately compare the cost of a new system.\n\nTom Gilbertson, VP of Application Engineering for Enercon surface treating",

        "text":"How to report explosives incidents\n\nIn an explosives emergency call 000 or the Explosives Emergency Hotline (1300\u00a0739\u00a0868). This includes any theft of explosives, any possibility of theft of explosives, if you suspect a theft of explosives, or if there is a break-in to an explosives storage facility, room or area.\n\nExplosives incidents include misfires and events where an explosive is or seems to be lost, stolen or involved in accidental explosion, fire or spillage.\n\nUnder the Explosives Act, an 'authority holder' must notify the Chief Inspector of Explosives of any explosives incident resulting in loss of life, personal injury or property damage.\n\nThe authority holder may be the individual, company or partnership licensed to conduct an activity under their control and the safety management system or security plan when the incident occurs.\n\nAn explosives incident may involve:\n\n  \u2022 a vehicle transporting ammonium nitrate that catches fire\n  \u2022 explosives stolen or missing from a magazine\n  \u2022 a misfire during an attempt to fire a shot.\n\nIt might also include:\n\n  \u2022 flyrock when it comes to rest outside the exclusion zone\n  \u2022 oxides of nitrogen, including:\n    \u2022 when the visible cloud of NOx fume crosses the boundary of the exclusion zone\n    \u2022 when a person within the exclusion zone is exposed to a visible cloud of NOx fume (e.g. in a safe haven or shelter)\n    \u2022 after the exclusion zone has been cleared and people have re-entered the site and, due to the topography, holes or crevasses, contain dangerous concentration of NOx gases and personnel can enter those areas.\n\nIncident reports\n\nIncident reports give industry and regulators data that they can use to identify trends that may affect safety and security. Timely incident reporting enables the production of industry-wide alerts about safety and security issues, which help prevent similar incidents.\n\nPrompt incident reporting is good practice and enables you to address safety and security deficiencies and share any learnings with industry and regulators.\n\nIt is important that incident reports are completed and sent promptly to the Explosives Inspectorate. See below for more information about reporting.\n\nRequirements of safety management systems\n\nAll licence holders conducting explosives activities must have and use a safety management system (SMS). Part of this should be clear procedures for incident reporting.\n\nAn SMS should at least include a standard incident report form, incident reporting contact numbers, email addresses and a process to support the incident reporting system.\n\nAn SMS should also maintain a record of all incidents. This will include appropriate level investigations with recommendations and follow-up to ensure that recommendations are implemented.\n\nAn incident should trigger a review of process, the plant or equipment involved, and personnel training and interface.\n\nReporting explosives incidents\n\nInitial advice\n\nImmediately after the incident, call the explosives response number to advise what's happened.\n\nThe regulator must be aware of explosives incidents as soon as they happen so they can initiate an appropriate response, from confirming the incident issues to sending inspectors to the incident site.\n\nFormal written advice\n\nShortly after, send an email (preferred), fax or letter to the Explosives Inspectorate. This should contain the telephone reporting details of the inspector you reported the incident to, and the date and time you reported it.\n\nReporting under multiple legislation\n\nMining and Petroleum and Gas (P&G) legislation may also cover the use of explosives at mine sites or on P&G tenures where it may be necessary to report to more than one inspectorate within the Safety and Health Division.\n\nIf you report an explosive incident to the Mines Inspectorate, P&G Inspectorate or Explosives Inspectorate, the incident report will be passed on by the receiving inspectorate to the other affected inspectorates.\n\nSo you may provide the single incident report to one inspectorate, who will ensure it's distributed within the Safety and Health Division.\n\nHowever, if you also need to report the incident to the Queensland Police Service, Workplace Health and Safety Queensland, or another government department or agency, you'll need to provide separate advice to them.\n\nThe guidelines for reporting an incident are clear. However, if there is any doubt, you should submit an incident report to the Explosives Inspectorate.",

        "text":"Home Page Photo Carousel of Projects\n\nPosted on: April 16, 2017\n\nDo you have questions about asbestos in town? Here is information for you.\n\n\nOur goal is to share information and encourage all involved parties to share information, so that all citizens, especially those who live close to the Metrolina Warehouse site, are well informed. The Town of Davidson will serve as the local connector to resources, since we are not the experts in this arena. Please contact the employees listed below if your questions are not answered by the content on this page:\n\nLindsay Laird, planning technician in our planning department, can answer questions related to permits and digging.\n\nEmail: llaird@townofdavidson.org\n\nPhone: 704-940-9611\n\nCarmen Clemsic, Town Clerk, can also answer questions.\n\nEmail: cclemsic@townofdavidson.org\n\nPhone: 704-940-9614\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) is responsible for work being done at the Metrolina Warehouse site (301 Depot Street). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for remediation the properties adjacent to the Metrolina Warehouse site and in the surrounding area. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (Division of Public Health) can answer questions regarding health concerns based on potential asbestos exposure.\n\nMetrolina Warehouse site (301 Depot Street)\n\nIn September 2016, Miller-Valentine, the developer for the Metrolina Warehouse site, held a meeting with citizens who live adjacent to the site to discuss their plans for their proposed Davidson Depot project. At that meeting, the developer and a representative from the NC Department of Environmental Quality\u2019s Brownfields Program discussed the plans for environmental remediation of the underground asbestos material at the site. \u00a0Many specific and detailed questions were asked about the remediation and construction processes. At that time, the developer was not far along enough in the planning process to be able to fully answer questions from citizens -- they are working on that plan to share with citizens at a future meeting. Also in that September meeting, concerns were raised by citizens about the impacts adjacent to the site, so the state requested the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s review of the area in Davidson.\n\nMetrolina Warehouse site (301 Depot Street) outlined in red:\n\nOn December 15, 2016, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality held a meeting at the Ada Jenkins Center to explain its interim process to re-stabilize the Metrolina Warehouse site. They placed green silt fencing around the west side of the site along Sloan Street to contain any asbestos that might be released due to erosion or varmints digging.\u00a0\n\nIn January 2017, they completed the interim process to secure the Metrolina Warehouse site until a more permanent engineered process is determined. This interim work included:\n\n  \u2022 Installation of a closure system for the exposed asbestos-containing material at the property.\n  \u2022 Stabilization of the slope along Sloan Street to prevent further release of asbestos-containing material from the property.\n  \u2022 Maintenance and monitoring.\n  \u2022 Precautions for asbestos-containing material exposure will be required during the work at the property.\n\nNCDEQ Fact Sheet\n\nIf you see asbestos-containing material that has been released from the Metrolina Warehouse site or have questions about environmental issues related to the site, please contact the following people:\n\nMiguel Alvalle\n\nNorth Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ)\n\nDivision of Waste Management\n\n610 East Center Avenue, Suite 310\n\nMooresville, NC 28115\n\nEmail: Miguel.Alvalle@ncdenr.gov\n\nPhone: 704-663-1699\u00a0\n\nCarolyn Minnich, Brownfields Project Manager\n\nNorth Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ)\n\nEmail: carolyn.minnich@ncdenr.gov\n\nPhone: 704-661-0330\n\nEPA work adjacent to Metrolina Warehouse site\n\nOn November 1, 2016, the representative from the state\u2019s Brownfields Program and the U.S. EPA came to Davidson to conduct a site survey and to make plans to contact adjacent residents. When they were here, they discovered some asbestos-containing material along Eden and Sloan streets that was released from the site. The release was the result of a varmint digging in to the embankment and a localized area where erosion had occurred. The property owner was contacted and immediately hired a certified contractor to remove the material and remediate. \u00a0The EPA is visiting properties in a ring around the Metrolina Warehouse site property to see if residents\/property owners will agree to free soil testing. If asbestos is found on their site, the EPA will fund remediation, making the property safe. Update as of August 28, 2017: The EPA will conclude their work in Davidson on Wednesday, August 30, 2017 and have scheduled a community meeting for October 3, 2017 to provide an overview of the successful remediation work they completed. They will also review post-remediation protocol with citizens.\n\nEPA Fact Sheet #1\n\nEPA Fact Sheet #2\n\nEPA Fact Sheet #3\n\nEPA Fact Sheet #4\n\nHere is a map that shows which properties were tested and the results at each property:\n\n\nLink to map\n\nWork to remediate properties is scheduled to begin on April 24, 2017. As of now, we have been told that they will start working on the properties along:\n\n1. Depot Street, then possibly\u00a0\n\n2. Eden Street and then\u00a0\n\n3. Sloan Street and the other areas nearby\n\nStreets will be closed to vehicular traffic while work is being done. Citizens will be notified of closures ahead of time, and a detour will be set up. \u00a0Work will last approximately 2-4 months.\n\nFor questions related to the EPA's work, please contact:\n\nJordan Garrard\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency On-Scene Coordinator\n\nEmail: garrard.jordan@epa.gov\n\nPhone: 678-644-8648\n\nAngela Miller\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Community Involvement Coordinator\n\nEmail: miller.angela@epa.gov\n\nPhone: 678-575-8132\n\nHealth Concerns\n\nIf you are concerned that you might have been exposed to asbestos and have questions about your health, please contact the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (Division of Public Health):\n\nBeth Dittman\n\nEnvironmental Program Consultant\n\nEmail: nchace@dhhs.nc.gov\n\nPhone: 919-707-5900\n\nHealth Assessment Consultation & Education Fact Sheet\n\nLimiting Environmental Exposure\n\nFacebook Twitter Google Plus Email",
