        "text":"Review Comment\n\n[FILM 1011] Blockbuster (Intro to Genre Study)\n\nJanuary 05, 2018\n\nGregg, Ronald\n[FILM 1011] Blockbuster (Intro to Genre Study)\n\nThis class was an absolute joke and by far the fluffiest\/BS class I've EVER taken throughout my entire educational history.\n\nGregg is a professor that unfortunately does not belong at an institution at Columbia. He has no clue how to deliver a good lecture. His lecture style is just him standing behind the podium and reading off his lengthy notes non-stop... & his visual aid (PowerPoint) barely has any points on it to complement what he is saying. It was thus so easy to not catch what he was saying once you missed a little halfway. You will definitely see tons of people doing their own stuff during the lecture (that is if they even come in the first place). Also, I'd like to point out that sometimes what he is lecturing on feels so forced - e.g. he makes it seem like the majority of the films produced post 9\/11 were because of 9\/11; how certain films are feminist films even when they really aren't. In other words, I feel that he tried to force drawing observations from the films even when the link between them is really, really weak. Attendance for class is taken occasionally.\n\nThis class also had a mandatory discussion session ran by TAs (for undergrads). The discussion session was even worse - there was no agenda for the discussion session other than to discuss about the film watched during most weeks. The discussion session was maybe about 5 minutes legit and the other 55 minutes stretched out BS. It's very common for my classmates to skip the discussion session (even when it is graded - 20%!). I remembered like half skipped the 2nd discussion session. The census among peers is that it is an ABSOLUTELY-A-WASTE-OF-TIME-I-PROMISE-YOU! Never had more meaningless discussion sessions. I'd bet that no one would even attend it if it wasn't graded. Sorry that I'm kinda repeating my point but if what I've said doesn't tell you the quality of the discussion session, I don't know what will. Just hope that you have a good TA to make it bearable.\n\nTL;DR: do NOT take this class unless you want the fluffiest ever possible class with an incompetent but very nice and approachable Professor. I can guarantee you that you won't learn as much (if any at all) as what you think you'll. Blockbuster is not Gregg's speciality. His speciality: LGBT-related. Maybe his LGBT film class\/other classes are better taught, idk.\n\n\nMuch lighter than other 3 credits courses\n\n2 Papers (25% each): 5-7 pages (double-spaced) for each paper. Instructions for papers were given about just 5 days for the first one & probably about 1.5 weeks (after complains about the timeliness of the first) in advance for the second one IIRC. The papers have nothing to do with what was taught in class. They are more like research papers. Need to reference course readings for just the 2nd paper.\n\n1 Final (30%): 3 essay questions in about 3hrs - related to what's \"taught\" in class\/discussed in the discussion section. Referencing course readings expected - the more, the better. Open book\/notes. Use laptop to type essays out.\n\nDiscussion (20%): The more BS you can talk about, the better. Absolutely waste of time.\n\nTAs (for undergrads) have 100% control over your grade. They grade everything. So if your TA sucks, good luck.\n\nDirectory Data\n\nDept\/Subj Directory Course Professor Year Semester Time Section",

The quality I received from Assignmentexpert was below my expectations, so I want others to know because it probably won\u2019t be up to yours either. I do not think the quality of their work would ever meet the expectations of a college professor. In my opinion, the writing level of Assignmentexpert is below college level and most likely would give you a lower grade than you would want from your class. The grammar is not bad, however, it is unsophisticated in style, which would send a red flag to your professor that you do not write on a college level. It would be a wise thing for you to read all the reviews on this site before you decide whether to work with\n\nServices: 2\n\nEver since my experience with customer service, I decided I was going to post an review. Even though I tried to explain that I could not use the unacceptable paper and get a satisfactory grade, Assignmentexpert did little to offer me any recourse. They insisted that because the paper had already been written, I could not get any money back. I had no choice but to decide whether to use the paper or not. Now I realize that I should have listened to the reviews about the poor customer service and chosen a different writing service.\n\nPrices: 3\n\nI agree with the other reviews here about the prices of being affordable. I should have realized that there was going to be problems with a lower cost service. I know there are other more expensive writing services, but the cheap prices attracted me to Assignmentexpert. If you so choose to make the same mistake I did, be aware that you get what you pay for. Their prices may be cheaper, but that comes at a price, so don\u2019t expect the quality you are looking for; you are better spending more to get a better quality service. So, heed the warning of the reviews that have been posted here; they are telling the truth!\n\nSupport: 1\n\nI wanted to write this review mainly because of the total lack of support I received by this writing service when I had an issue about the standard of my paper. Since they were not willing to support me, I was left paying for a paper I couldn\u2019t use. I ended up turning my paper in late because I was unable to use the paper I was counting on to deliver. Because of their unwillingness to help me, my grades are in jeopardy. My review, as well as the others posted here, is telling the truth about Assignmentexpert being a company you cannot trust.\n\nDelivery: 2\n\nAlthough it was delivered before the deadline, I received my paper at the very last second, with no time at all for addressing any issues. I suppose I should be happy it was on time, but it would have been nice to have it early so I would have been able to write the paper myself since it did not meet my expectations. Yes, it was my fault I waited until the last minute, but all the reviews here made me feel as though this writing service would deliver a paper I could use on time. It was on time, but I couldn\u2019t use it.\n\nOverall Experience: 2\n\nAll in all, my experience with was substandard. I wasn\u2019t able to use the service I paid for. I am a college student, so I don\u2019t have a lot of wiggle room in my budget, so it was not easy paying for this service. I was very upset to have nothing to show for the money I spent. Please, listen to the reviews posted here, each and every review here is correct and tells you what you can expect from this writing service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            1 Comment\n\n            Leave a Reply\n\n            Name (required)\n\n            Email (required)",

I think some of the early lesson videos were not timed very well (either too long or too short). An ideal video length for one lesson for me is 8-10 minutes. I liked the flow of the course, the planning of the lessons and the examples used. The subtitles were not always well-transcribed. The transcribers did not bother to check up non-English words, the real spellings of researcher names, and in one case actually got this professor's name wrong. End of unit quizzes being exact repeats of lesson quizzes made things a bit too easy to pass.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Luna L\n\nDec 17, 2016\n\nThe content of this course is really interesting and intriguing, but it would better if there are additional sources and information. Also, instead of mainly picture the teacher in the video, it would be nice if there could be more graphics and diagrams to illustrate the idea that the professor is trying to convey. Besides those minor deficiencies, I would say that this is a really good course and will worth your time.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Yoko L\n\nApr 30, 2020\n\nAs a Japanese English bilingual, I found this course very interesting as it gave me some insight into how I might've acquired the two languages and explain some of the phenomenons I experience day to day when switching between languages. It also gave me some fruit for thought on how I might expose the two languages to kids down the future.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Lisa G\n\nJul 03, 2017\n\nI would have liked deeper explanations of the charts and diagrams that were used so it's easier for those of us not familiar with the studies or brain images to understand.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the class! I'm getting my MA in Linguistics and Language Acquisition in the fall, and this was a great warm-up into that.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Mariana C\n\nMay 31, 2020\n\nSome really nice concepts and ideas shared, but sometimes questions at the end of the videos (and final assessment) were REALLY nonsense - related to little details which were not that relevant to the general knowledge we should gain after the course.\n\nOther than that, it was really nice taking this course.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Isabel F\n\nJan 12, 2018\n\nI enjoyed the course and learned quite a bit, yet I agree with all the improvements suggested by others here in the review section. Just videos and the same quizzes over and over is a bit monotonous. But still, I would recommend the course for anybody interested in the subject matter.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Linda\n\nJun 29, 2020\n\nThe course was interesting. Perhaps a little bit to much of a summary of studies, one after another. There were no assignments which could help to process the theories. But I did learn some interesting aspects of the bilingual brain.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Daniela L N D\n\nOct 22, 2017\n\nThe course is excellent and doctor Hernandez is an amazing professor. However, I believe it would be very good if we could have access to the studies and articles he talks about during the course.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Tyson P d M U\n\nOct 07, 2019\n\nVery interesting and informative. Many aspects make you think of language, the mind, and the brain in a different way. I enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Vita d G\n\nApr 06, 2018\n\nLoved it. I hope there will be a follow up. I still have many questions about bilingualism\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Elena A\n\nMay 04, 2017\n\nVery good context, yet the modules could be better distinguished.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Carolina A V S\n\nJun 09, 2018\n\nVery interesting information. Good course.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Angelina L\n\nFeb 15, 2017\n\nVery useful and scientific oriented\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Claudia A M\n\nMar 05, 2019\n\nIt was interesting.",

It shares the thoughts and experiences of current international students and provides a window onto student life here.\n\nStudent Q&A film\nThe student Q&A film includes Varvara from Australia\nand Ardon from Singapore\n\nQuick Comments from our international students\n\n\u201cI think once I got my head around the difference of the UK approach \u2013 Cambridge's focusing far more on a passion for your course and on\u00a0thinking deeply and critically about your subject -\u00a0applying to\u00a0Cambridge was much less daunting. I found settling in to life at\u00a0Christ's and the rhythm of Cambridge to be fairly quick, as everyone\u00a0arrives in Cambridge not really knowing what to expect \u2013 you don't\u00a0feel any more out of place than a student coming from somewhere in the\u00a0UK.\u201d\n\nRosie - History and Politics (Washington, US)\n\n\n\"I was worried that studying for Spanish 'Bachillerato' rather than A-levels or IB would look bad on my application, but it didn't matter.\u00a0\u00a0At Cambridge they look for the best students, and you get an outstanding academic education. Moreover, university life here also differs a lot from what you would get in Spain, it involves much more than the academic part: societies, sports and living in College. You have friends from all over the world, but there is also a nice Spanish community university-wide. Life at Christ's is amazing, it wasn't hard to settle in at all, and I would truly recommend applying!\"\n\nMaria - Mathematics (Madrid, Spain).\u00a0\n\nRead\u00a0more from Maria in her student profile.\n\n\"Cambridge and Christ's are both amazing places to be an international student. The college has plenty of international students who I met right when I arrived, and there is a small army of college staff who genuinely care about ensuring we get all the support we need. The University has an active Brazilian society, and there's even a Brazilian stall in the town's market that sells p\u00e3o de queijo and guaran\u00e1!\"\n\nJack - Human, Social and Political Sciences (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil).\u00a0Read more in Jack's student profile.\n\n\"Christ's college is a very friendly environment. I have found that having friends you can trust not only makes settling at Christ's easier but also makes your study at Cambridge much more enjoyable. I would highly recommend Christ's College.\"\n\nChisom - Engineering (Abuja, Nigeria)\n\nEU webinar advert\n\u00a0Sign up for the EU webinar on 8 October\n\n\"Moving abroad for university was something that excited me, however I was also a bit worried about settling in, meeting new people and making new friends. Nevertheless, Cambridge has been great in making me feel welcome. From a brilliantly organised international fresher\u2019s week that gave me some time to fit in while also meeting people from college who were going through the same experience of moving abroad, to the College Family system- I was never short of support and company. I strongly feel that Christ\u2019s College has done a great job in welcoming me, and the College system is amazing as you are able to develop deeper friendships in the College community. The College staff is always kind and helpful. In addition, the central location of College and the Upper Hall where I could eat and talk with friends daily, made socialising much easier. Throughout the year, College events helped me have fun and relax. If you are a student from abroad, I definitely recommend Christ\u2019s. You will feel like home.\"\n\nAnissa - Medicine (Nicosia, Cyprus).\u00a0Read more from Anissa in her student profile\u00a0and see our country-specific page for students from Cyprus\n\nChrist's is a good choice for a college. Education which depends on the college side (mainly supervisions) is great. Also college provides good accommodation and is in a quite convenient, yet not very crowded, central part of town. Moving here was not difficult at all as the college staff was quite helpful.\"\n\nAntanas - Mathematics (Vilnius, Lithuania)\n\n\"I didn't know what to expect, but I am pleased with what Christ's turned out to be. Both socially and academically, there is not a thing that has disappointed me here, and\u00a0I have received all the support I asked for.\"\n\nSimeon - Computer Science (Yambol,\u00a0Bulgaria).\u00a0Read more from Simeon in his student profile and see our country-specific page for students from Bulgaria.\n\n\"The admissions team were extraordinarily helpful and encouraging throughout the whole process, helping me put to rest many of the concerns I had about applying with less common international qualifications.\u201d\n\nMartin - Offer holder for Economics (Copenhagen, Denmark). See our country-specific page for students from Denmark.\n\n\"You will be surprised how much Christ\u2018s College and Lithuania have in common. This is not only due to a considerable fraction of Lithuanian students who choose to study at Christ\u2018s (currently ~10), but also because of quite a few Lithuanian alumni of the college. One of the most known alumni of the college is Dr Yusuf Hamied. He has partial Lithuanian origins and was born in Lithuanian capital Vilnius in 1936. Dr Hamied is a chairman of the biggest pharmaceuticals company in India, and, therefore, he is amongst most honorouble people of Christ\u2018s College. A huge theatre in the New Court is even named after him.\n\n\"Christ\u2018s College is one of the most successful in terms of academic results, and this is reflected in the Tompkins Table (1st\u00a0place for 2017-18!). This college may offer you help in your academic development via competent Directors of Studies and supervisors. Hard work should be rewarded and Christ\u2018s College knows that. There are many monetary funds to encourage students taking e.g. summer internships (Long Vacation Travel Grant) and many others. If you\u2018re getting a first class result, you may also expect some financial award. There is a certain scholarship called Blyth Eastern European Bursary established for students from Eastern European countries and the Baltic States who have successfully participated in any international science olympiad and won a medal. If this applies to you, you will straightaway get an award provided you are admitted to the college.\n\n\"Last but not least, there is a friendly atmosphere among Christ\u2018s students, also among the students and the staff. You will meet very kind people like nurse and chaplain, a very bright librarian for whom it took 5 seconds to identify my Lithuanian origins judging from the name ending, and, surely you will meet many charming squirrels each time you enter the Fellows\u2018 Garden.\"\n\nGilbertas - Natural Sciences (Klaip\u0117da,\u00a0Lithuania)\n\n\"Hey! I am Arqum Anwar from Karachi, Pakistan and I recently graduated with a B.A. in Natural Sciences. As the first in my family to study abroad, I remember feeling excited yet angsty when applying to Cambridge. Although I chose Christ\u2019s without attending an open day, I have found it to be a welcoming community of students and educators.\u00a0From my own time as the International Officer of the student union (the JCR), I have seen the position being used more proactively to support international students and their welfare. The college has also been keen to cater to my religious needs, for example, with meals during Ramadan. If you are a Pakistani student considering to apply, know that there are several resources and many helpful faces to help you settle in. I am excited to know that another student from my school will be joining Christ\u2019s next year and I hope the number of Pakistanis, local or internationals, continues to increase.\"\n\nArqum - Natural Sciences (Karachi, Pakistan).\u00a0Read more from Arqum in his student profile.\n\n\n\"At first glance it seems pretty intimidating to move to a foreign country, away from everything you know. I think it's really important to not be afraid to go outside of your comfort zone to meet people. Everything about life and studying in England seemed a bit foreign at first, so I think it's important to ask if you don't understand something - even if it's just a pop culture reference. People are happy to help, so you shouldn't be embarrassed!\"\n\nDiana - Human, Social and Political Sciences (Poland). Read more from Diana in her student profile and see our country-specific page for students from Poland.\n\n\"I like all the nature in the college, like the fish, birds, squirrels and ducks.\"\n\nElise - Geography (Zurich, Switzerland).\u00a0Read more from Elise in her student profile.\n\n\"Christ\u2019s College, is a college that I have found most friendly and easiest to settle in \/ get used to for Chinese applicants. Given its moderate size, the procedure for everything is straightforward and paperwork is minimum. This college has the best students\u2019 canteen among all the colleges that I know, in case you cannot or are not interested in cooking for yourselves. Christ\u2019s is also one among the few colleges that offer options to not vacate your room for vacations even if you are not here - a feature of envy for every single one of my friends\u2019 from outside college.\n\nI find it one of the best choices I have ever made to come to this college. It is a place you can call home.\"\n\nTianhou - Engineering (Harbin, China)\n\n\"I have met so many new friends from different countries at Christ\u2019s, and spending time with them has been enjoyable. Having the gym two-minute walk from my room, it was fantastic! Furthermore, the older students, my tutor and my college family made me feel as if I was at home. The formal hall is a great place to invite friends from other colleges as well as to celebrate your birthday.\"\n\nNeophytos - Medicine\u00a0(Egkomi, Nicosia -\u00a0Cyprus).\u00a0Read more from Neophytos in his student profile\u00a0and see our country-specific page for students from Cyprus\n\n\"Christ's is really homely - just the right size so you don't feel overwhelmed, yet not so small that you are unable to find anyone with things in common with you. There's a really lovely network of international students here - last Chinese New Y... (truncated)",

My head is brimming with ways to tackle some of the problems I\u2019ve had with my writing. What a luxury too, to spend an entire weekend, talking purely plays and writing.\u201d Sarah Thomas, Technical Assistant\n\n\u201cOla\u2019s approach may end up being the \u2018missing ingredient\u2019 that will get you writing\u201d Sasha Frankland, Writer\/Actress\n\n\u201cThe Fast Track weekend revitalised my approach to playwriting at a time when I couldn\u2019t see the wood for the trees. Providing the fundamentals of the craft \u201a the course was inspiring. I left with clarity and renewed determination. Thank you.\u201d Dan Horrigan, Director, Writer, Teacher\n\n\u201cReally good to find an inclusive group of like minded people \u2026 (I) actually developed my idea into a more coherent form.\u201d \u00a0Danny King, Writer\n\n\u201cI really enjoyed the intimate feel \u2026 lots of chances to feedback, ask questions \u2026 (Ola is) very friendly, welcoming, not at all intimidating and very knowledgeable.\u201d Jane Upton, Writer\n\n\u201cRefreshing style of teaching \u2026 Reignited my interest in taking my writing seriously \u2026 Great food, great people!\u201d Kate Buchanan, Creative\n\n\u201cI thought the workshop really was very helpful and insightful, and I\u2019m sure I will use a lot of the tools that were mentioned throughout.\u201d\u00a0Rebecca Delgado, Creative\n\n\u201cMy ideas for my one woman show have been re-ignited thanks to your course.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Virginia Thompson, Actor\n\n\u201cLoved the course,\u00a0inspiring but highly practical.\u201d\u00a0Liz Wright, Editor\n\n\u201cWhat a fab weekend, I got so much out of the time and now feel like all I need to do is get some of my ideas out of my head into the universe!\u201d Maya Wasowicz, Actor\n\n\n\u201cOla, thank you.

I loved your red shoes.\u201d\u00a0Jo Christiane, Writer\n\n\n\u201cI attended an EI workshop a year ago and left the weekend feeling thoroughly motivated to complete a piece of writing. As a result I have had a performed reading at Theatre 503 and I have actually finished the full length script. Ola and Nadine were incredibly helpful whilst I was trying to finish my play and through their script report service I gained invaluable advice. I knew that there were weaknesses with the play\u00a0but wasn\u2019t sure exactly where or why.\u00a0They were able to pin point quite clearly where the weaknesses \u00a0were and gave suggestions on how they might be improved.

His presence in the development of playwrights in the UK over the last ten years is massively under rated. Laura Wade, Lucy Prebble, Chloe Moss, Jack Thorne, Mike Bartlett, DC Moore; Alia Bano, Bola Agbaje, Polly Stenham and countless more owe massive amounts to him.
