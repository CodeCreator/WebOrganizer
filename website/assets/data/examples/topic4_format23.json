Right now we have the best teachers around. The academics are excellent! I am extra grateful for the Christ centered emphasis this year. I want my children to hear about Jesus everyday and grow to love Him. That is why we send our kids there! Thank you teachers for your devotion and sacrifice!\n\n  \u2022 Posted July 10, 2015\n  \u2022 Submitted by a parent\n\nIt was a Great school in 2010. There is no continuity at Westside which is its biggest downfall. The school has gone through 4 Head of School in the five years our child has attended. Teachers and staff come and go. Their focus switched from curriculum to sports in 2012. Communication lacks! So everything changes and not many families stay. Dress code changed for the 2015-16 year to no longer allow shorts or dresses but parents weren't informed until after new enrollment. There used to be a lunch program and that was done away with for the coming year as well. The staff that has stayed has been determined to help parents transition, but you can tell it is getting to them as well. Can you say stress!\n\n  \u2022 Posted July 08, 2015\n  \u2022 Submitted by a parent\n\nI moved my child from public to private and I cannot believe the difference it made in his self confidence. He was well received and integrated with the current students as if he had been at Westfield for years. So glad of our decision!\n\n  \u2022 Posted May 04, 2015\n  \u2022 Submitted by a parent\n\nI think it has been a great school for my part time homeschooling daughter. They have worked with her (filling in the gaps in what we did not teach). Despite being new, she was accepted readily by her peers and she likes all her teachers -- well, there is one that gives her a bit of a tough time, but that is her weak subject. I respect the comments of those who say they have lost confidence in the quality of the teaching there. However, we have not seen it. I see a caring and loving attitude by all their -- teachers, administrators, and coaches. They try to keep the costs down as much as possible. I am reminded that it is easier to criticize than to be part of the solution. It is more difficult than it looks.\n\n  \u2022 Posted April 20, 2015\n  \u2022 Submitted by a parent\n\nWhen Mr. Andrews was there it was ran a lot better. When McInnis was hired, it was the worst thing that could happen to that school. Pulled my child out two months after he started running it because of this director failure to even control his own children.\n\n  \u2022 Posted March 09, 2015\n  \u2022 Submitted by a parent\n\nSchool administration changed mid year...several people left. Hasn't been same...very much a shame because this WAS a great school.\n\n  \u2022 Posted March 07, 2015\n  \u2022 Submitted by a parent\n\nWCA is an excellent school. My children have attended there since 2011. One is now finishing up second grade. One is fishing kindergarten. My second grader is a straight A student and reads above average grade level. My kindergartener reads and spells fluently and she knows all of her sight words. I am so thankful for the dedicated , excellent teaching they have received from the teachers at WCA. My children are loved and cared for on an individual level by the teachers and staff. Also the teachers are highly qualified and all hold or have to undergo certification on an international level through ACSI, a higher standard then public state-wide certification. The school is also accredited through ACSI. This is an extremely wonderful place and my children are receiving a high quality education in both academics and in the bible. They care about their spiritual health, too. It also one of the most affordable private schools in the area. Every parent should send their kid here, if you want them to them to have an education better than public school, and know Jesus and make him known!!\n\n  \u2022 Posted August 18, 2014\n  \u2022 Submitted by a parent\n\nExcellent school in the past. Unfortunately, not at this current time. Admission standards seem to have relaxed significantly from what they were when our family was accepted years ago. It seems like the screening process has been eliminated & admission is granted to anyone who can afford the cost. If this is not the case, then something is seriously broken in their admissions interview process. Additionally, leadership changed expectations midyear & did not adhere to the school handbook. There also seems to be a lack of communication between administrators & teaching staff. I had hoped our kids would attend WCA much longer than they have, but we could not knowingly send them somewhere that violates its own policies & procedures. The final straw for us was when a letter was sent home requesting assistance for fundraising activities that contained outright lies. I hope the administrator simply didn't read the letter he signed, but that lack of attention to detail is not acceptable from our kids, & I expect better from those employed to lead & guide them.\n\n  \u2022 Posted July 25, 2014\n  \u2022 Submitted by a parent\n\nThe absolute worst experience in my children's life. It should tell you something that my kids will attend Bibb Co public schools after my experience at WCA.\n\n  \u2022 Posted December 13, 2011\n  \u2022 Submitted by a parent\n\nMy child attended WBA from 6th -12th. His was the first graduating class. I feel he received a good, solid education but more importantly, a Biblical based education taught by loving, dedicated Christian teachers. He is doing well in college. Due to the small class size these teachers were able to truly get to know their students - their strengths as well as weaknesses which gave them a much better insight into each student as a complete person - not just as a student. The relationships, with classmates and teachers, my son gained at WBA are relationships that have and will continue most likely for the rest his life. Most importantly, is his relationship with the Lord, and how he was encouraged and challenged each day to live for Christ. I must say the education he received at WBA is priceless and will have an eternal affect on him and those whose lives he touches. His time at WBA is priceless.\n\nAround Westside Christian Academy Browse popular neighborhoods, cities and ZIP codes around Westside Christian Academy\n\nArea For Sale Median\nListing Price\n31005 274 $238,379\n31008 235 $191,200\n31028 101 $144,900\n31030 107 $105,000\n31036 65 $152,000\n31047 271 $283,900\n31052 76 $149,900\n31069 315 $232,622\n31088 564 $215,000\n31093 205 $129,900\n31098 N\/A N\/A\n31201 55 $117,000\n31206 300 $64,900\n31216 277 $183,990\n31217 138 $75,000\nArea For Sale Median\nListing Price\nAtlanta 10,847 $379,900\nBonaire 277 $239,900\nByron 243 $191,200\nCenterville 139 $174,000\nCochran 40 $144,950\nElko 25 $89,375\nForsyth 240 $265,000\nFort Valley 100 $106,500\nGray 159 $249,900\nHawkinsville 65 $155,500\nKathleen 272 $283,900\nLizella 78 $149,900\nMacon 1,866 $144,900\nMilledgeville 447 $174,450\nPerry 468 $245,900\n\n*School data provided by National Center for Education Statistics, Pitney Bowes, and GreatSchools.

        "text":"See what our students have to say about our classes!\n\nFor a controller with limited exposure to NAV, I cannot fathom a more meaningful investment of time. The course is robust and the materials covered extremely comprehensive. You will be more than satisfied with the experience. Brilliant instructors.\n\nScott Hulme, Nature Fresh Farms\n\nAmanda and Kerry put on a phenomenal course that is both engaging and informational. I learned tons of simple tips and tricks to improve efficiency and had the opportunity to practice new concepts with hands on time during the class. I loved hearing their experiences and learning best practices that I can now apply in my company.\n\nKelsey Colvin, Barkley Company\n\nNavision is a powerful software for capturing data. This class is one of the ways to understand how to collect, manage and report on the data most effectively. Why try to learn it on your own when you can take advantage of Kerry and Amanda\u2019s wealth of knowledge?\n\nJoanie Quinlan, Sun Valley Rice\n\nFor a new user, this was a must for me. It really covered the basics of the accounting functions and best practices.\n\nMarni Stallings, Maxilift\n\nThis course is a must for those new to NAV or new in a Controllers role. The hands on learning and collaborative networking environment with fellow users is essential to teach you the \u201csmall stuff\u201d that can make a big difference in your productivity. Many of us have had little or no training, so this enables us to utilize and harness the system and take advantage of the reporting and analytical tools available. The class introduces you to many things you didn\u2019t know you didn\u2019t know about Nav. Whether a new user or seasoned veteran, there will be useful takeaways from the course.\n\nJen Brickner, Andy Gump\n\nFor any Controller using NAV, if you are in the process of converting to NAV, if you\u2019re new to NAV or if you\u2019ve been using NAV for a while, this is the class for you. Amanda and Kerry will either reinforce what you already know but more likely show you things that you don\u2019t know, point out things that you should be doing and things that you shouldn\u2019t be doing. I highly recommend this class.\n\nChristopher Scrivner, Rava Ranches\n\nThe Controller\u2019s Boot Camp provides content with the right level of detail and hands on exercises that you can immediately use back in the office. The presenters are seasoned and provide real life guidance.\n\nScott Sherburne, Sun Valley Rice\n\nThis course was fantastic for me as a new NAV user, but the whole group seemed to get a lot of best practices and ways to improve their existing systems. Amanda and Kerry are great instructors!\n\nMelissa Acker, Terso Solutions\n\nAnd lastly, YOUR class on schedules has made ME look like a hero.\u00a0 Running month end reports in Jet used to take 2-3 hours and the owner hated the way they looked.\u00a0 Running 6 schedules (CM, YTD, PM, PYTD, Budget CM and Budget YTD) takes about 10 minutes and it\u2019s formatted EXACTLY the way the owner wants \u2013 and has wanted for 10 years. \u00a0And I add ad hoc reports all the time \u2013 I LOVE schedules so thank you for making them so easy to understand.\n\nBruce Ostrowsky, World Emblem",

We've been there since 1991, in this neighborhood for all those years. The elementary school is the best. All the teachers and office ladies have been some of the most caring and loving people you'll ever come across. They all love [our] their \"kids\" and their jobs. The kids come out of the school with a great foundation for the coming years. They care and will go out of their way to help each and ever student! Everyone is family and I've never seen so many parents wanting to volunteer for a school. I couldn't have chosen a better school. Rock Creek is my school and I'm proud to have been a part of it all theses years!\n\nRock Creek Elementary School 5\n\nPosted July 25, 2013\n- a parent\nMy children have gone to this school for the past two years and they will be attending this upcoming year as well. I wish more schools were like this one. Rock Creek's parents and volunteers did an outstanding job last year in making sure that the budget cuts did not affect the children tremendously. Rock Creek's principal is a superb individual and he should be applauded for all his hard work and dedication in this school. Some of the office ladies are not so friendly but with all the good work of the teachers, volunteers, parents and principal. you hardly notice them.\n\nRock Creek Elementary School 5\n\nPosted December 07, 2011\n- a parent\nMy son has been attending Rock Creek since April 2010 and has thrived ever since he started here. The teachers, staff and new principal are very interested in the kids and their development. They truly have the kids' best interests at heart and want to see them succeed. I am so thankful that he is learning life long lessons here to help him become the best that he can be. I cannot emphasize how much I truly appreciate everyone at this school.\n\nRock Creek Elementary School 5\n\nPosted April 13, 2011\n- a community member\nthis is the best school ever!

It is a wonderfully balanced compilation of the feelings, frustrations and difficulties confronted by the adults who care for and work with very unique children.\n\nThe author, Cassie Zupke, definitely delivers \u201950 things \u00a0parents and teachers of students with autism want each other to know\u2019 and does a great job in presenting both sets of experiences. Zupke walks a fine line yet honors the viewpoint of \u00a0the individuals involved. They all share the same goal but often follow diverse paths in getting there and have to work with policies and rules that are sometimes difficult to understand.\n\nAll 269 pages (paperback) are conversational and set up as very user-friendly. A parent can scan through the table of contents and easily choose the topic that concerns them most at any point in time. The voice of many parents speak of blame, feelings of isolation, exhaustion, grief, acceptance, challenging transitions, depression, trust, and fear on their journey towards a future that is yet to unfold for their child.\n\nThe perspective of teachers is also shared and their caring mission to be supportive team players while maintaining boundaries is clear. The fact that teachers have no magic wand and need parents to communicate appropriately and support what they do on the home front is well presented.\n\nThis book addresses the underlying current of emotions from both parties quite well. The wish of both caretakers and educators to make the world a better and more inviting place for children learning to make their way in a world that is foreign to them is skillfully portrayed. Teachers invite parents to request knowledge and information about policies and procedures before casting blame and parents invite teachers to never make assumptions and make a concerted effort to \u2018see\u2019 what their world is really like.\n\nWe Said, They Said by Cassie Zupke is a must read for parents and teachers before they begin their respective voyages through the educational system. It provides a realistic voice for the things parents and teachers want to, and should, unload to one another as they begin their relationship as it helps \u2018clear the air\u2019 so to speak.\n\nReading this book will place parents and teachers in a starting block that is not only in a good position but a positive one. If you are in any way responsible for the development of a human being that resides in the world of autism, I encourage you to put this book on your shopping list today.\n\n\nBecause you read this post, you can get this book at a reduced price.

        "text":"New Hope Cambodia values all volunteers who have come to help us and the people of Mondul Bai. We hope that past volunteer\u2019s comments and experiences can be shared with those who may be considering volunteering with us.\n\nthis is good for child and adult for their future i hope to help people like you do\n\n\u2013 Miss Eang Chomnan, Phnom Phen, Cambodia \u2013 2 November 2015\n\nI had the most wonderful time teaching at New Hope. The organisation is inspiring, it allows you responsibility whilst giving great direction. The kids are wonderful and the whole environment is so friendly and welcoming. I would highly recommend this experience.\n\n\u2013 Miss Katya Warwick, London, United Kingdom \u2013 25 October 2015\n\nHonesty, integrity and kindness are all desirable \u2018qualities\u2019 in people where I am from . My greatest experience with New Hope and in Cambodia, was this these values are integrated into the hearts and souls of every individual. These children are filled with spirit and joy and it was more than a pleasure to teach them, it was a privileged. I am truly honored to have been apart of this program and will encourage others to participate in the most selfless and strong organization I have ever encountered\n\n\u2013 Miss Tamara Violet Partridge, Melbourne, Australia \u2013 20 October 2015\n\nMy time working at New Hope Cambodia was an unbelievably rewarding experience! It\u2019s hard to put it into words as a teenager, but the work I did truly gave me happiness! The staff and the kids were extremely gracious, and I really enjoyed seeing the students\u2019 enthusiasm and interest in learning! This experience has opened my eyes to a whole new part of the world, and it\u2019s definitely changed my life. I\u2019d really love to come back and work again, possibly even next year. New Hope Cambodia really does support a wonderful cause, and I was really honored to be able to lend my help to them!\n\n\u2013 Mr Blake Watabe, Honolulu, United States \u2013 27 September 2015\n\nI wasn\u2019t really sure what to expect when my girlfriend and I decided to volunteer at New Hope. It turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had. The team take extra care to make sure you are comfortable and know what to do; the kids are wonderful and are full of energy and the teachers are truly dedicated to their task. Cambodia is a wonderful country. Getting off the plane, and never having been to South East Asia, I was a little cautious of the roads. The driving is comparatively crazy to Australia, but I didn\u2019t see any road rage the entire time. They are a passive, patient people. There is so much to do and see in Siem Reap and beyond, and New Hope can help you to get there. Most importantly, the work New Hope does is inspirational. They provide food, medicine and support to the local people. Their work and sacrifice is amazing to see and experience.\n\n\u2013 Mr Angus Manson, Sydney, Australia \u2013 30 April 2015\n\nI went travelling for six weeks at the beginning of 2015 around Thailand and Cambodia, and amongst all the things I did on my travels, I can truly say the two weeks I spent at New Hope was the highlight of my trip. Teaching in the school was so much fun and an amazing experience as the children are so easy to work with and really appreciate you being there. It was really eye opening, but amazing at the same time to be in the school and see the local area. In addition the New Hope staff were extremely welcoming and a pleasure to work with everyday. They do everything they can to ensure you enjoy your time at New Hope and also help you arrange extra activities to see the sites and experience the best of what Siem Reap has to offer during your time off. Finally there is also a number of different social activities arranged for the volunteers, so you can get to know each other and make friends for life (as I did)!. I\u2019ll certainly be going back when I get the chance!\n\n\u2013 Mr Andy Teale, London, United Kingdom \u2013 18 April 2015\n\nAfter a month of teaching at New Hope in March 2015, it is safe to say that I have come away with a piece of my heart still left in Siem Reap. I wholeheartedly believe that this was the best experience that I have ever undertaken (& I am always trying new things & pushing myself out of my comfort zone). The teaching staff & the volunteer support staff, as well as the Golden Village family, are so incredibly dedicated & make the already memorable experience even better. The children \u2013 well what can I even say? They are little bundles of sunshine. I have made a promise to myself that I will return again next year & try & save as often as I can to make it these visits a regular occurence. What I got from this experience is difficult to put into words, but one thing that is certain is that it is a strong feeling & a learning curve that will stay with me forever.\n\n\u2013 Miss Amy Kenny, Ipswich, United Kingdom \u2013 15 April 2015\n\nJust completed our 4th volunteering term with New Hope and continue to be impressed by the dedication of all of the staff and the progress that is being made in the education, health and living conditions of the people of Mondul Bai village through the efforts of New Hope and the support of their sponsors. Can\u2019t wait to get back for our 5th visit later this year and recommend the volunteering experience to virtually all age groups.\n\n\u2013 Mr Robert & Jane Grant, Nelson Bay, Australia \u2013 18 March 2015\n\nI\u2019m sitting here trying to think of some words to write to describe my experience at New Hope but it really is indescribable. I have been home now for a month, and my two weeks at New Hope were truly, one of the times in my life I will never forget. The people you meet touch your heart and soul in more ways than one. I will be forever grateful. If you are tossing up whether to go or not, don\u2019t doubt it \u2013 just go, you will not regret it. Thank-you New Hope.\n\n\u2013 Miss Brittany Daly, Adelaide, Australia \u2013 1 March 2015\n\nMy month at NewHope was the greatest time I\u2019ve had for years (and I enjoy life a lot all the time). The local people and the other volunteers were so friendly and helpful, and the children at the school were all lovely. I was a teacher in England in some great schools for around 30 years, but never ever encountered such enthusiasm and desire to learn as I did at NewHope. For anyone thinking of volunteering at the school or the drop in health centre, I say GO FOR IT. You don\u2019t have to be a qualified teacher or whatever. You just need to have a genuine desire to help these wonderful people. And I can guarantee that you will make a difference, but \u2013 just as important \u2013 you will get so much from it yourself.\n\n\u2013 Mr Peter Meredith, Wadebridge, United Kingdom \u2013 22 January 2015\n\nThanks New Hope for another amazing experience this year. Getting out into the villages to meet (and treat) children and adults with disability, and their families was immensely rewarding, as was working alongside and getting to know the wonderful and welcoming Khmer staff and my lovely fellow volunteers. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists are much needed in the disability program!!!\n\n\u2013 Mrs Judith Nance, Brisbane, Australia \u2013 25 December 2014\n\nHi New Hope Angles!!! I have been back in Australia for 2 weeks and it\u2019s a daily struggle to settle back into the life I had here before It was only a short stay, but the day I had in the kitchen was one of the most memorable of my trip! I am seriously trying to work out how and when I can come back for longer!!!! Thankyou for opening my eyes to the goodness people are doing for others out there!! Xx Nicole Mayo.\n\n\u2013 Miss Nicole Mayo, Melbourne, Australia \u2013 20 November 2014\n\nAt the end of October I finished 5 weeks as a volunteer in the Outreach department at New Hope. It was a rewarding experience made better by the friendly Khmer staff and other volunteers from Germany, Britain and Australia. I can recommend as an opportunity of a lifetime. I will be returning.\n\n\u2013 Mr Bob Page, Perth, Australia \u2013 18 November 2014\n\nRecently completed our 3rd volunteering stay with New Hope, the experiences were just as rewarding as our first visit. The dedicated NH staff and the joy of working with the Khmer children and people is a genuine pleasure and the progress being made is a credit to the Organisation. We will be coming back again!\n\n\u2013 Mr Robert & Jane Grant, Nelson Bay, Australia \u2013 16 September 2014\n\nVolunteering at New Hope was one of the best experiences of my life. If like me you\u2019ve never volunteered before and are feeling nervous, have no fear. The staff at New Hope are truly lovely and amazing people. From the moment I landed at Siem Reap airport, I couldn\u2019t have been looked after any better. I volunteered in the school teaching grade 1. The children and teachers there are incredible people \u2013 very hard working! I can\u2019t recommend volunteering at New Hope enough but don\u2019t take my word for it \u2013 give it a try!!!\n\n\u2013 Miss Shirley Tang, London, United Kingdom \u2013 17 August 2014\n\nSpending 3 weeks with grade two has completely changed my life. New Hope will change yours too. Everyone is extremely friendly, and I am keen to return as soon as possible. New Hope is truly amazing!\n\n\u2013 Mr Mark Hughes, Sydney, Australia \u2013 5 August 2014\n\nI spent 10 days working at New Hope in February with Terry Moran installing fire equipment in the New Hope buildings. While I was there I saw most areas of New Hope\u2019s operation and couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by what is being achieved by the hard working staff and volunteers. I would like to continue a relationship with this friendly organization and hope to return and work with them in the future.\n\n\u2013 Mr Brian Stitt, Sydney, Australia \u2013 20 May 2014\n\nHave just done my 5th trip to New Hope as a volunteer in the clinic.Amazing people with the biggest smiles and so grateful for help that is given. New Hope are doing a fantastic job and all the team there are truly wonderful. I will keep returning as a volunteer as my heart belongs in Cambodia.\n\n\u2013 Miss Diane Ralston, Gold Coast, Australia \u2013 10 April 2014\n\nThe 2 weeks that I spent volunte... (truncated)",

I appreciate the staff for the many updates on his progress and the phone calls when there were concerns or issues. No other school would have taken the time to do this. If it wasn't for NCPS, I doubt that my son would be graduating this month and attending college. I highly recommend NCPS.\n\nNorthern California Preparatory School 4\n\nPosted May 14, 2015\n- a parent\nMy son has attended NCPS this year. He is on the autism spectrum, but high functioning and diploma bound. The teachers, administrators, and therapists are truly top notch! They are all special education and general Ed. certified and have always helped my son focus and learn while making him feel loved and appreciated, WOW! The classes average 10-14 students with two teachers per class and about 100 total. They have family events sometimes too (bowling, etc) so that we can all meet each other. I would give the school five stars or more except for the food program. They offer lunch\/snacks that also include highly processed (sugar\/grain) pseudo-foods. These kids especially need lunches\/snacks made from real foods in their natural state ONLY in order to heal their very damaged gut microbiomes which affects their ability to learn. See David Perlmutter's book \"Brain Maker\" for explanation. If the food program was thus improved, then I would say that Northern California Preparatory School would be ideal to prepare most spectrum kids for the rigors of upper grades in public high school and beyond!\n\nNorthern California Preparatory School 5\n\nPosted April 21, 2015\n- a parent\nThank you Ms. Johnson and teachers at NCPS for providing a positive learning environment for my son who is ASD. Life as we knew it fell apart in 7th grade. Our son couldn't function at school - couldn't make it through the day without being physically sick from stress. He didn't attend school for the better part of two years - and we were advised to have him do independent study. Not an acceptable alternative. For us, academics came secondary to having our son at school and with peers on a daily basis.Our son will be graduating soon after having exceptional attendance and grades at NCPS. He takes pride in his school and looks forward to being in the classroom and with his peers. He still has social-emotional goals to tackle, but NCPS has given him the framework to understand his challenges - and tools to work on improving his behavior and responses to the outside world. He's a work-in-progress, like most young men his age.Our son did well on his recent college placement exams. He did a lot of solid learning at NCPS - while homework and courses were carefully structured not to overwhelm students. The future is bright for my son - thanks in large part to NCPS.\n\nNorthern California Preparatory School 5\n\nPosted December 15, 2013\n- a community member\nI graduated from NCPS and stop by every year to tell the staff they were right! I was not the easiest student and always threatened to quit, but the staff never gave up on me. I am in college now and living on my own. I am doing good, but life is challenging. The staff tell you the truth at NCPS and as teens we don't want to hear the truth. Now I am an adult, I want to say thank you to all of the staff at NCPS. They definitely care about you. The Principal is firm but fair, now I understand the reasons why. If you are looking to put your son or daughter in this school, I would tell you it would be a good choice. I learned life lessons in this school besides just the usual subjects. To this day I stop by and see the staff, they are like my other family. Thank you NCPS! Your biggest fan!\n\nNorthern California Preparatory School 1\n\nPosted September 06, 2012\n- a community member\nNCPS is a VERY restrictive school. You cannot touch any student or teacher in any way. This includes handshakes. Students are supervised by staff at all times, and whenever a student goes as far as the next classroom, it is communicated to the entire school through a walkie talkie. Every single conversation between students is monitored by a staff member. Some staff members are also highly confrontational and will look for fights. The classrooms are the size of shoeboxes, and the teachers do not teach. They assign work and say just do it without directions or details. This school is for kids with behavior issues, so if your child has Asperger's Syndrome or any other learning disability that has to do with academics, he\/she will be treated like a student with behavior problems. Students cannot even make friends, because trading phone numbers is forbidden. A portion of the students at NCPS claim they they belong in gangs, thus wearing a plain red shirt or any shirt that has to do with certain cities is forbidden. Also, this is a \"therapeutic day program\", and students have to get all of their work done to see the \"therapists.\" The Principal just tries to get as many kids as possible.\n\nNorthern California Preparatory School 5\n\nPosted September 03, 2012\n- a community member\nNorthern California prep school is the best school in Sacramento it has made me the man that i am today without them i dont know where i would be today i want thank all the staff for all of there support i could not have done it without them and most of all i want to thank the principle of Northern California Prep School for the great respect that was shown to me over the years and she is a BIG help toi all of here students she has helped me in many ways hope the best for the students and teachers Thank you to the owner of Northern California Prep School for opening this school for all of us students we really appreciate what you have done for us i am forever thankful for that school i enjoyed every second that i got to spend at that school I have always thought school was going to be the worst experience i would have but this school has changed my prospective on school it made me realize how much education is important and how that with out education i would not become anything thank you for that reality check\n\nNorthern California Preparatory School 5\n\nPosted August 11, 2012\n- a parent\nWe've been very happy with NCPS. Our son qualifies as both a gifted student (very high IQ) and as a special ed student (dyslexia, dysgraphia and ADHD). The public school system was woefully inadequate in addressing his educational needs. After years of spinning our wheels in a traditional school setting we tried NCPS and have been thrilled. The small class sizes and structured learning environment fit the bill for our son. The teachers are supportive and encouraging...our kid is actually regaining some of the self esteem that he lost in the public schools.\n\nNorthern California Preparatory School 5\n\nPosted August 16, 2011\n- a parent\nNCPS was a Godsend. The principle Ms. Johnson and her staff went above and beyond to help my son and our family. The school actually challenges the students and makes them accountable for their behavior. My son struggled for years and developed a learned sense of apathy. After attending NCPS he has grown emotionally and academically. I cannot thank the staff enough for all the attention and care that was given to our son. We have seen how difficult it is for kids with emotional or learning disabilities to thrive in school environments and do not blame the schools or teachers in any way. Serving a challenged population is difficult and requires great organization, care and positive regard for each student in spite of their difficult behaviors. The staff at NCPS are up to the challenge, are available when needed and have the students best interest at heart. My son only spent one school year there (because of distance) but the skills he developed and the change in him will last a lifetime. If you are considering NCPS as a school for your student, you will put him in good hands...lots of them. A very appreciative parent\n\nNorthern California Preparatory School 2\n\nPosted February 20, 2010\n- a student\nI am a former student ,this is a great school made great by some of the great teachers in my memory that went there when i went there ,One thing i have to say negative is the fact that i felt alot of the students and including myself weren't helped as much as others ,I felt that the ranks of those who were to succeed was determined immediately ,and once you were deemed not worth the time to help or unfit to give help to you were gone in a moment and treated unfairly,i still have some contact with some other previous students that share my feelings as well,however it was the principal who made it felt this way.But the help you did get by the teachers will stay in heart and mind forever there were truly some that made you feel respected no matter what and valuable no matter what.\n\nNorthern California Preparatory School 5\n\nPosted November 18, 2008\n- a parent\nThis is an incredible school!! My son had tried several education programs. As a student with mild mental retardation and Bipolar Disorder, finding a school where he could just manage a full day was a challenge. NCPS has provided my son the opportunity to gain pratical skills in an esteem building setting. Accountability has been the key to his success. The principal is committed and the staff outstanding. Highly reccommend it to families struggling to find the right place.\n\nNearby schools\n\nSign up for email updates\n\nConnect with us\n\nTranslate this web page\n\nAbout GreatSchools\n\nOur mission is to help millions of parents get a great education for their kids. is an independent nonprofit and the leading national source of school information for families. 199...
