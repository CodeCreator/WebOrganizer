It is the story of two childhood friends who are separated when the little girl Joan is taken away in a hot air balloon and dropped in darkest Africa where the natives hail her as the great White Goddess and make her ruler of their people. Meanwhile, her pal David spends his life looking for her. He eventually finds her, but maybe he wishes he hadn't because wherever she goes, trouble is sure to follow.\n\n\nCritic Reviews for Queen of the Jungle\n\nThere are no critic reviews yet for Queen of the Jungle.

Is Tokyo Ghoul worth watching?\n\nThe story follows Ken Kaneki, a college student who meets a woman named Rize Kamishiro at Anteiku, a coffee shop. They share an interest in literature and plan a date. While walking Rize home, Ken is attacked by her. Rize reveals that she is a ghoul, a human-like creature that hunts and devours human flesh. As she is about to finish him off, she is crushed by a falling platform. Kaneki is taken to the hospital in critical condition. The doctor decides to transplant Rize's organs into Ken. He then must deal with life as a half-human\/half-ghoul, including interacting with ghoul society and its conflicting factions, while striving to keep his identity secret from other humans.\n\nGenres: Anime | Horror\nStation: Tokyo MX (JP)\nRating: 9.44\/10 from 25 users\nStatus: Ended\nStart: 2014-07-03\n\nTokyo Ghoul Season 2 Air Dates\n\nS02E01 - New Surge Air Date: 08 January 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E02 - Dancing Flowers Air Date: 15 January 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E03 - Hangman Air Date: 22 January 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E04 - Deeper Layers Air Date: 29 January 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E05 - Rift Air Date: 05 February 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E06 - Thousand Paths Air Date: 12 February 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E07 - Permeation Air Date: 19 February 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E08 - Old Nines Air Date: 26 February 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E09 - City in Waiting Air Date: 05 March 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E10 - Last Rain Air Date: 12 March 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E11 - Deluge of Flowers Air Date: 19 March 2015 14:55 -\n\nS02E12 - Ken Air Date: 26 March 2015 14:55 -\n\nSorry, but right now we don't have any sources for this episode.\n\nTokyo Ghoul Actors\n\nMamoru Miyano(Shuu Tsukiyama)\n\nAyahi Takagaki(Itori)\n\nKana Hanazawa(Rize Kamishiro)\n\nToshiyuki Toyonaga(Hideyoshi Nagachika)\n\nY\u00fbki Kaji(Ayato Kirishima)\n\nKoji Yusa(Tatara)\n\nYuuki Kaji(Ayato Kirishima)\n\nDaisuke Namikawa(Kishou Arima)\n\nFumiko Orikasa(Ryouko Fueguchi)\n\nHaruka Tomatsu(Nashiro Yasuhisa)\n\nToru Ookawa(Kureo Mado)\n\nYuichi Nakamura(Renji Yomo)\n\nLoading...

She is quiet, smart, and proper, not to mention that she also has a wealthy family. Hazuki sometimes feels insecure about her ties with her friends, and thinks she will lose them forever. (But Doremi reassures that they will be friends forever.)\n\nOne important fact about Hazuki is that she has an extreme fear of ghosts. Whenever there is mention of one, she'll scream, run around, and constantly shout Majorika's name.\n\nHazuki has no real love interest, but she has affection for Yada Masaru. Though she is the love interest of Fujio from FLAT 4, she doesn't appear to like him that way.\n\nHazuki's birthday is on the February 14th. Her favorite color is orange, and her instrument is the violin. Her family consists of her parents and her maid, Baaya.\n\nHer enchantation spell is \"Paipai Ponpoi Puwapuwa Puu\", her Magical Stage's being \"Paipai Ponpoi Shinayakani\".\n\nIn the English adaption, her name is changed to Reanne Griffith in 4Kids Entertainment.\n\nVoice Actors\nAkiya, Tomoko\nStichler, Christine\nPapandrea, Giovanna\nSoler, Rebecca\nTak, Carolina\nArellano, Mayra",

Just email me with a list of what songs you want, and tell me whether you want romaji and\/or translation. I try to update couple times a month, and translation requests will generally be added in the order they're received. However, if you are requesting romaji only, it will probably get added in the next update. The reason for this is that it takes me almost no time to do romanisations, whereas translations actually require a bit of thought and are thus more time-consuming. I no longer take full album requests unless you are paying. There is no fixed maximum number of songs per request, but five or fewer is a good amount.\n\nIf I cannot find Japanese lyrics for the song(s) requests, I will ask you to find me a site that has them or scans of the booklet. As a last resort I may be willing to translate from romaji or from an audio file. However, not everyone sings clearly enough to transcribe by ear.\n\nPaying for Translations\n\nAll requests are free if you are willing to wait. However, even though the queue is nowhere near as long as it used to be, the wait is still pretty long due to me not having much free time to work on the site. If you would like your request translated faster, I am willing to do so for a fee. I generally charge $5 per song and payment can be made by cash, money order, or Paypal. The time-frame for paid translations is anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on how many songs you request and how busy I am. However, it will always be much, much quicker than waiting on the queue.\n\n\nSometimes I make typos, or sometimes the artist sings something different than what's written in the lyrics, or they use an alternate reading for a kanji, etc. Some older songs that were translated when I was not yet fluent may have mistakes. If you notice anything that needs correcting, please tell me.\n\nRequests Queue\n\nFollowing is a list of requests in the order that I received them, which is also roughly the order I will work on them. The date at the top of each section is when I received the requests. I can no longer guarantee a time-frame for them to be done by. All I can say is I will try to update a couple times a month and will try to add oldest requests first. However, single songs may get done quicker than larger requests.\n\nIf you are wondering what happened to the long queue that was here, early in 2012, I made an announcement that I would be deleting all old requests if the requester did not email me and say they still wanted them. I did keep the old list, though, and if you are just now seeing this notice and still would like me to keep your request, you can email me and I will move them to the current queue.\n\n[ rec'd 9\/30\/09 ]\n- Digimon Adventure: Chichin Puipui Unchi Poipoi, Haguruma Jikake no Mori, Ore wa Ogremon\n- Digimon 02: Atarashii Taiyou, Boku no Ketsuron, Boku wa Boku Datte, Find Out, Forever Friends, Friend~Itsu Mademo Wasurenai~, Futari de Habatakeba, Happy Smile, Kaze ni Mukatte, Party, Refelection, Sora Iro no Kaze, Sora wo Crawl, Shining Star, Shiny Days, Steppin' Out, Sun Goes Down, Super Girl, Team, Tomadoi, Yamato Nadeshiko Panic, Yasashii Ame, Zettai All Right~Digimental Up!~\n\n[ rec'd 12\/9\/12 ]\n- Idoling!!!: One Up!!!\n- Saegusa U-ka IN db: I Can't See, I Can't Feel, Itsumo Sugao no Watashi de Itai, Kimi no Ai ni Tsutsumarete Itai, Tobitatenai Watashi ni Anata ga Tsubasa wo Kureta\n\n[ rec'd 7\/6\/13 ]\n- Hayashibara Megumi: Kirameku Kakera\n- Hiyama Nobuyuki: Joh!
