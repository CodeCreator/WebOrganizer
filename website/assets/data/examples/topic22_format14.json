I didnt notice it too much prior to putting on the sways and links...Its sounds like i left a wrench in the lower arm and when you hit bumps at low speed it rattle\/thuds like crazy...Doesnt do it at high speed or when pushing the car really hard..Its the weirdest thing. That is what lead me to think, based on the post here, it could be related to the TSB and have something to do with the upper strut bush\/mount...I've never had any vehicles with struts that made anything like this kinda noise...I've checked, tightened every bolt on this car and I cannot recreate the noise at rest...I really appreciate your time...Hell, I'm gettin so crazy I may just buy the struts and see where we go from there...Thanks...DD\n  6.

These are not that rare, commonly referred to as Rapier missile trailers. The picture shows the metal bars on the front headboard and where they were on the tailgate. These are to hold the missile boxes in place. Looks like it has the correct wheels on it to match the Land Rover 127 Rapier. The handbakes commonly seize. You can get new, replacement slave cylinders off ebay. Normally a bit of a job to get the drums off though. The suspension has some pins to hold in place are these ok? Or is it the rubber you need, I was told the big suspension rubbers are the same as on trucks,\n  2. I have a Parts List for a willys mb. Now Sold Full title: Parts List for Willys Truck Model MB 1\/4 Ton 4x4 Built for US Government dated August 1, 1943 This is obviously an original genuine parts list. It has the first page missing. No idea what was on it, but it starts at page 3 and the remains of a page are evident. So, I had a quick look and there are a few copies available. for starters is anyone interested in this? anyone able to put a sensible value on it? is it worth more due to it being a 1943 version? anyone wan\n  3. Lined my three up for a quick VE day photo yesterday\n  4. Brightwells have 4 tracked vehicles in next weeks auction, all non runners \/ spares. 2 Scimitar Spartan Sultan No connection myself, just pointing them out https:\/\/www.brightwellslive.com\/timedauctions\/index\/4971?take=24&skip=24\n  5. V8bob\n\n    Kit Kat\n\n    If it is the look that you need, just put 2 of the 2 finger foil wrapped ones in your wrapper.\n  6. I looked at one of these trailers a while ago and couldn\u2019t see a chassis plate on it either. Not sure if they had them, you would think it would some where? The trailer I saw had the army reg stencilled on the side of the tow A frame. Depending on when\/how it was painted you might be able to see signs of it?\n  7. Well, that could be caused by numerous different things if it has been stood for ten years. But if it has been stood in a heated garage or outside on the beach would make the biggest difference. Assuming outside, a best bet would be electrics or sticking valves. you could pull off one plug lead at a time with engine running to see if one of them doesn\u2019t make it run worse. If You find removing a particular plug lead makes no difference, that will be the one to start checking out.\n  8. Hi, Where do you need the trailer recovering from?\n  9. I have a spare but it is probably much too big. It is about 2 5\/8\u201d bore and over 10\u201d diameter. I think my spare is off a Ford\n  10. Hi, I have had a few 50s american cars and these are pretty common on that era vehicle. I think that those ones being marked as ac probably went on anything that had a carb of the right size. when I needed a replacement, ebay.com(usa) had plenty listed and they were often listed by the sizes - often not vehicle specific. I know that doesn\u2019t really help you, but it is a pretty common universal part. cheers, Bob\n  11. I have also been trying to find some military style plates. unfortunately within the last couple of months all the rules have changed. So if you have managed to get some very recently please let us know the supplier? I have bought in the past, only probably six months ago with no problems, but alas that is no longer possible. It appears show plates are no longer available. update - Chestnut Registrations still do the military ones. I havejust ordered them. Thanks for that info.\n  \u2022 Create New...",
