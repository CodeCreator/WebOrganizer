All NCU's have an area called 'overflow'. This is where superfluous nanobots are stored, until they can be utilized, although most modern Nano Programs produce no more than the exact amount of bots needed for the program. This means that many of us carry around large areas of NCU that could have been filled with useful bots.\nThe Hacker Interface effectively commands all types of 'roaming' bots into this area to aid your various nano skills. Using a hacker interface is generally considered an illegal action, and there is a 0,012 percent chance that the NCU will blow, but it's a risk most Fixers are ready to take.\nNOTE: The Interface must be upgraded manually to follow the advancement of the user. Right-click on it to do so when you raise in level.\nFlags Visible, No Drop\nCan Carry, Wear, Use, Can Wear With Social Armor\nPatch 13.8 14.2.1 14.4.2 15.9\nChange QL:\nType Utility\nSlot Hud 2\nValue 500\nMass 0.25kg\nTo Use User Profession == Fixer\nUser Level >= 2 and\nTo Equip User Profession == Fixer and\nUser Level >= 1\nOn Equip User Modify Sensory improvement 1 \u00a0\nUser Modify Matter metamorphosis 1 \u00a0\nUser Modify Biological metamorphosis 1 \u00a0\nUser Modify Psychological modifications 1 \u00a0\nUser Modify Matter creation 1 \u00a0\nUser Modify Time and space 1 \u00a0\nOn Use User Summon Item FINC \u00a0\nif Profession == Fixer \u00a0and\nLevel >= 2 \u00a0\nUser Destroy Item \u00a0\nif Profession == Fixer \u00a0and\nLevel >= 2 \u00a0\nlol @ 2002-10-02 15:05\nis it REALLY a 0,012% chance that the NCU will blow? =p\nNepi @ 2003-06-03 12:48\nnever happened to me yet^^\nLtBurlap @ 2003-08-18 04:32\nso people dont have to ask:\n(Nanoprogramming Interface + Lockpick) =\nNCU hacker interface\nGng @ 2003-09-16 04:30\nwell.. if i buy like 60-120 of them.. and upgrade to my level, i should have a fairly high chance of actually getting the blowup, if it does exist :P\nkrinky @ 2004-01-13 16:59\nIf it is possible for it to blow, i wonder what would happen if it did.
