        "text":"Please note: these are two separate properties and property developers but we have combined the notices because the properties are adjacent to one another.\n\n30-50 S. Colorado Blvd.\n\nThe CPHCA, the developer, and adjacent neighbors recently reached agreement regarding the rezoning of this former church site.\u00a0 Documents have been signed to restrict development to no more than 11 duplexes (22 units) with a maximum height of 35 feet.\u00a0 Units will have enclosed 2 car garages. \u00a0The property will be accessed by a private alley between Albion and Colorado Blvd and will include a small internal lane.\u00a0 Visitor parking will be available along this lane.\u00a0 This rezoning request will go before city council for a public hearing on March 12.\u00a0 Per the developers, demolition of the church is tentatively scheduled for January. 2018.\n\n50 South Colorado Blvd Site Plan\n\n50 South Colorado Blvd. Elevations-1020\n\nThe City Council approved the rezoning of this church property to a PUD based on the G-RH-3 with waivers designation on March 12th.\u00a0 The developers are working with the City agencies for approval of their site plan. \u00a0Sue Bollman, a nearby neighbor and member of the Assn\u2019s BOD, has been in contact with them and informed that, due to asbestos, the demolition of the church will probably not happen until late this year (2018).\n\nThe developers are working on the design of the project and were planning the demolition of the church for the 2QTR 2019, with construction <most likely> starting in 3QTR 2019.\n\nUPDATE 11\/19\nAt a community meeting held at Graland, the developer explained the demolition and movement forward on the project was not able to occur due to a contractual obligation the previous owner, the Church, entered into with Verizon Wireless. \u00a0They hold a valid lease for a cell tower located in the church building that could continue thru 2023. \u00a0A representative for Verizon Wireless attended the meeting and assured neighbors the company was working on relocating the cell tower. \u00a0In the meantime, the property owner has taken steps to ensure the safety of the community and the neighborhood by limiting access to the site.\n\nThe Denver Police Department is aware of the community\u2019s concerns and taking steps to help maintain the safety and security of the property. If you see anyone at this location, please call 911 and report it immediately.\n\n10 S. Colorado Blvd.\n\nAn application to rezone this parcel immediately north of the 30-50 S. Colorado Blvd project was received in January 2018. \u00a0The application shows two duplex units (for a total of four dwellings) with access off the alley to a two-car garage for each unit. This rezoning request will go before the planning board and city council soon and we will keep the neighborhood informed. \u00a0Here is the application and concept plan.\u00a0\n\nSue Bollman arranged a meeting between the owner\u2019s rep\/architect, Jeff Cline, and the immediate neighbors which was held on April 9th.\u00a0 The meeting was well attended (thanks Sue!).\u00a0 Jeff presented drawings showing what they intend to build, which are two-duplex buildings.\u00a0 The neighbors were generally supportive of this proposal.\u00a0 Comments and questions were directed more at materials and protection from the noise on Colorado Blvd. than on the development approach.\u00a0 They were initially going to request a rezoning to G-RH-3, because that\u2019s what the adjacent property (30-50 S. Colo Blvd) has received.\u00a0 However this approach would have necessitated restrictive covenants.\u00a0 At the suggestion of Tom Hart, our Assn\u2019s Zoning Committee Chair, the developer will now request a rezoning to E-TU-C.\u00a0 This will maintain the \u201cUrban Edge\u201d designation that the majority of Hilltop has, and will restrict them to the two-duplex buildings they are proposing.\n\n\nHere is the updated application and current concept plan.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Official Map Amendment Planning Board Notice was received on 2\/19\/2019. \u00a0Public hearing is set for Wednesday, March 6, 2019 at 3pm in the Parr-Widener Community Room (#389), City & County Bldg at 1437 Bannock St.",

The winning home will also be featured on the television show, Today's Homeowner with Danny Lipford.\n\n\"In these economic times, managing energy costs is a very important concern for homeowners for both budgetary and environmental reasons,\" says Lipford. \"One of the best long-term investments you can make in your home is to improve its outer envelope, which includes windows and doors. Not only will you reduce your energy bills, you'll add value to your home should you decide to sell it.\"\n\n\"High utility bills are like throwing money right out the window. Wasting energy has a huge impact on costs, comfort and the environment,\" adds Brian Hedlund, Jeld-Wen product manager. \"No matter where you live, your home doesn't have to be an energy hog, and we're out to prove it by demonstrating that energy efficient windows and doors can help lower utility bills.\"\n\nThe winners of Jeld-Wen's utility bill contest last year, the Quimby family of Maine, were paying upwards of $1,000 per bill to fill the heating oil tank for their 119-year-old farmhouse. After installing 35 new Jeld-Wen energy efficient windows and two doors, the family has cut their heating oil consumption nearly in half, the company reports.\n\nTo enter this year's contest, homeowners can submit their entry online at",

They are from a program called Project2Heal located in North Carolina. \u00a0We are happy to have them in our Canine Assisted Therapy program at our facility.\u00a0 They have also joined us for social therapy visits to Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital, and Kerrville VA Medical Center right here in South Texas.\n\nPPH Noah with Kriser\u2019s Donations\nPPH Noah with the wonderful donations from our friends at Kriser\u2019s Natural Pet Food, Stone Oak, Texas\n\nA big shout out of gratitude goes to Kriser\u2019s Natural Pet Food in Stone Oak, TX!\u00a0 They started our pups Rusty and Lucy off right with a wonderful donation of snacks and toys! \u00a0If you would like to help supply our puppies with fun toys and treats as well, you can find a link to our Amazon wish list devoted to the addition of our new pups here! \u00a0Our pups in training greatly appreciate all the love and support of their puppy raising families, volunteers, and your gracious donations!\n\nWe are excited to see what 2018 will bring! \u00a0On behalf of Team San Antonio, we wish you and your family and friends a very Happy New Year!\n\nRecent Posts\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nfive + eleven =\n\nStart typing and press Enter to search",
