Research shows that canine colleagues can improve staff productivity and wellbeing: a warm welcome to our new colleague, Miss Coco, the French Bulldog.\n\nAbbey Thomas , one of our Senior designers is the proud mum of Coco, a 9-week old French bulldog. She has a play-pen next to her desk which allows a safe place for Coco to be during work time. She lets her come out, exercise and play with all of us after every nap. \u201cI love bringing her to work. She is really calming and gives great cuddles. She really boosts the creative vibe in the studio. Not only is it good for us but great for her as well. Socialisation is really important for her at this young age and she is meeting lots of different people, experiencing new things and getting lots of attention\u2026.and treats!!!\"\n\nAccording to Reed.co.uk, about 8% of employees in the UK have canine colleagues. This practice has been going in the pet sector in companies like Mars Petcare, Pets at Home, Nestle Purina, Blue Cross Vets, Dogs Trust and Pets at Home. It's wonderful to be joining-in on the trend.\n\nAt MBC, we really love having Coco around. \u201cAs designers, we are always looking for a fresh \"boost\" of inspiration and I\u2019ll go: \u2018Right, I need some puppy love. And off I go to find Coco\u2019,\u201d says Adam Dhaliwal, Head of Artwork. \u201cA few minutes later, I\u2019m a different person.\u201d\n\nWe all feel so lucky to have Coco join the team at MBC and we cannot wait to see her every day!\n\nAlly Mansell-Cook\nAlly Mansell-Cook\n\nAlways on the lookout to engage in Meaningful Bubbly Conversation. Might Be Cool if we have a chat- give us a call anytime to discuss your Business-Changing Creative initiatives!",

Have you heard?\n\n\nThe Edmonton Valley Zoo\u2019s NEW Urban Farm is now open!\n\n\nThe Urban Farm is a new exhibit which allows city slickers to experience a modern day farm setting. All the sights, sounds, and smells of old MacDonald\u2019s farm are right here, in the heart of the River Valley, ready for you to enjoy. If you have never been on a farm, head down for a visit that will have you grinning from ear-to-ear. We promise a Get Closer opportunity with our animals that will delight, surprise and engage even the most seasoned farmer or rancher.\n\nOur farmyard gang includes:\n\n\nSpeckle Park cows\n\n\nBoer cross Toggenburg goats\n\n\nJuliana pigs\n\n\nShetland and babydoll sheep\n\n\nAraucana chickens\n\n\nFlemish giant rabbits\n\n\nMiniature horses\n\n\nPeahens (female peacocks)\n\n\nGuinea hens\n\n\nNew animals will be introduced periodically, so don\u2019t be surprised if you show up one day and see a turkey or perhaps a new species of pig or goat. Look out for the Chantecler chicks, they arrive in May! Be prepared for an overload of cuteness when the babies arrive. Pick up an annual membership to the zoo and visit often to watch our Urban Farm family grow.\n\nEnjoy the thrill of a hands-on experience with animals in the contact yard. Here, you will have a chance to meet various animals, give them a gentle pat, take their photos, and even groom them. Did you know that goats love to be brushed?\n\n\nTry your hand at milking a cow! There are two life-sized cow models with udders full of water. One cow will demonstrate a milking machine while the other model is there for you to milk. Go ahead and give it a try, see if you have the magic touch.\n\n\nCheck out the incubation room where you can watch eggs hatch and fuzzy little chicks emerge. Baby chicks will hatch frequently throughout the summer!\n\n\nBe sure to watch the honey bees busy at work, there are several hives to observe.\n\nUrban farmer zoo staff will be on hand to answer questions and interpreters will stop by to demonstrate how to make ice cream, churn butter, or card sheep\u2019s wool. You may even find yourself playing a round of Urban Farm Jeopardy!\n\n\nTake a moment to look at the Alberta poultry, dairy, and beef displays to learn about our local food production industries.\n\nThe Urban Farm is for everyone! All ages will appreciate the sights and sounds of our beautiful animals. There is so much to see and touch, and plenty of opportunities to learn about farming in Alberta.\n\nThe building will be open year-round, so you can visit your barnyard pals 364 days of the year. This is a great way to watch baby animals mature, and you can observe your favourite animals to learn about their unique behaviours.\n\n\nThe rooftop of the Urban Farm is designed to allow the goats to roam. So if you hear bleating, look up to the sky, and you will see our goats wandering about.\n\n\nThe on-site cafe (opening soon!) will serve delicious food and if you feel like ice cream, head to The Dairy Bar.\n\n\nWe hope you enjoy your Urban Farm experiences! We look forward to seeing you often!\n\nUrban Farm: Make the Most Out of your Visit\n\n\nThe Contact Yard is one of the first places visitors head to when they arrive at the Urban Farm. Here you can experience animals in a unique, Get Closer way. For many, this will be the first time they will have stood beside a goat or a cow, or pet a chicken.\n\n\nEven though our Urban Farm zoo family is very used to human contact, we want to help you and your children have a wonderful experience filled with happy memories!\n\nContact Yard Etiquette\n  \u2022 Enter the Contact Yard slowly with a calm and gentle demeanour\n  \u2022 Use a soft, low voice when talking to the animals\n  \u2022 If you stand still many animals will come to you\n  \u2022 Always approach an animal slowly but if they walk away, let them go\n  \u2022 Walk toward the animal\u2019s side rather than directly toward its face\n  \u2022 Enter with empty hands \u2013 leave water bottles, backpacks, bags, and toys at the entrance\n  \u2022 Never feed human food to the animals\n\n\nAt the Urban Farm we always respect the animals wishes. If they choose to walk away rather than be patted, we let them go and do not pursue them. This is their home and we always want them to feel safe and comfortable. The animals in the contact yard are rotated throughout the day so everybody gets time with the visitors as well as rest breaks from the activity.\n\n\nAll of our animals are fed properly prepared diets to maintain their optimum weight and body composition. Lean animals are healthy animals. Even a modest weight gain can add extra pressure on their feet and joints, and can have a negative impact on their heart and other organs.\n\n\nUrban Farmers will be nearby at all times to answer questions or help make an introduction to one of our furry or feathered residents. They also feed, clean, and offer the animals enrichments such as vegetable popsicles \u2013 chickens, goats and sheep just love their popsicles!\n\nDid you know?\n  \u2022 Goats are highly curious animals and will eat just about anything. Please leave your purses, backpacks, toys, and snacks behind.All animals \u2013 domesticated or wild \u2013 prefer calm, low voices, and slow, unhurried movements. Even the most gentle animal can react poorly to erratic movements, such as waving arms, or loud noises and yelling. Please be respectful of the animals\u2019 environment!\n\nAfter several years of planning and construction, the first element of Nature\u2019s Wild Backyard at the Edmonton Valley Zoo is complete. The Urban Farm, a contemporary take on old MacDonald\u2019s farm, has opened its barn doors.\n\n\nThe Urban Farm offers an immersive experience where humans and animals are surrounded by a common landscape; where boundaries are erased and zoo guests can better grasp the interconnectedness between themselves, the animals, and the environment; where you can explore the relationship between yourself and the other beings we share the planet with.\n\n\nThe Edmonton Valley Zoo\u2019s role as a leader in the areas of conservation, environmental stewardship, and education is an important part of the Urban Farm experience. This open and airy modern-day farm showcases experiential learning and exhibitry at its best.\n\n\nHere, guests of all ages can observe goats, sheep, pigs, rabbits, chickens, and a host of others in their open enclosures. Without the restriction of bars and plexiglass barriers, visitors can enjoy an intimate Get Closer experience watching the animals, listening to their grunts and bleats, and yes, smelling the hay and the scent of their feathers and hair.\n\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll want to spend time in the contact yard where visitors can give our Urban Farm critters a pat, maybe even groom a goat, or give a sweet Babydoll sheep a scratch. Drop by 364 days a year to watch the baby goats grow up or the lambs mature into sheep. Throughout the summer, be sure to check the incubation room to witness the chicks hatching.\n\n\nEnjoy exhibits that explain farm life, demonstrations on how to make ice cream and card wool, and try your hand at milking a life-sized model cow. Did I mention the goats wander across the rooftop?\n\n\nThe Nature\u2019s Wild Backyard design was honoured by the Canadian Architects\u2019 Awards of Excellence in 2014, and the Urban Farm experience exemplifies why. There is a lot to do, see, and learn here.\n\n\nThe zoo staff \u2013 aka Urban Farmers \u2013 are always on hand to answer questions and make sure your experience is a memorable one.\n\n\nFood producers such as Alberta dairy, beef, and poultry tell their stories in displays and talk about how the animals are raised and cared for. The Urban Farm will help you understand where your food comes from.\n\n\nYou will also learn about the importance of supporting Alberta farmers. Buying local is a sustainable approach to food production and supports conservation initiatives. All modern agriculture has an environmental impact, so one of the best ways people can reduce their carbon footprint is to buy local.\n\n\nLearn how easy it is to buy locally, and how this important decision has far-reaching benefits. The on-site cafe and the Moo at the Zoo dairy bar support this mandate and source their food products locally. \u00a0\n\n\nGrab a friend and head down to the Urban Farm \u2013 our furry and feathered friends look forward to meeting you!",

        "text":"The Rocky Mountain Dawgs Project is very excited to present Service Dog Team Three!!\n\nBarret is a thirteen week old German Shepherd that hails from Hampton Georgia, brought to us by Lonnie and Debbie Philpot, breeders or premier German Shepherd and Hanovarian Hounds.\n\nSfc. Tom Cauffman served in the United States Army from '84-'88 and returned, first to the National Guard but then active duty, in 2003. He is currently awaiting his retirement this summer. From his multiple deployments he has suffered a traumatic brain injury, severe hearing loss and PTS. Tom has had an older service dog that was trained for him several years ago, but she is in need of retirement so we at the Rocky Mountain Dawgs Project have chosen him to receive our third puppy.\u2028Tom me Barret (whom he named) last Thursday when John and Katie from Scent Imprint for Dogs traveled to evaluate two puppies that the Philpot's had on hand. The first dog did not warm to Tom, but the second was almost magical.\n\n\"When I first went to meet him there were two siblings to choose from, a brother and sister. The female was stand offish, but the male jumped right up in my lap and then sat there between my legs and looked out ahead as if \u201cI got this\u201d and was watching everything around me as if he had my back. I knew then this was the dog for me. After John and Katie tested him and said that he would do well in their training program I was excited to know that I had a new battle buddy in training to watch my back.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without the assistance of The Rocky Mountain Dawgs Project and Scent Imprint for Dogs. Thank you all very much! I am excited to see what the future brings!\" - Tom\u00a0\n\n\u00a9 2013 by Rocky Mountain Dawgs Project\n\n  \u2022 Facebook Social Icon\n  \u2022 Instagram\nA\u00a0501(c)(3) non-profit organization\nThis site was designed with the\nwebsite builder.

        "text":"\n\n\n  \u2022 National home sales rose 4.5% from November to December.\n  \u2022 Actual (not seasonally adjusted) activity was up 4.1% year-over-year (y-o-y).\n  \u2022 The number of newly listed homes climbed 3.3% from November to December.\n  \u2022 The MLS\u00ae Home Price Index (HPI) in December was up 9.1% y-o-y.\n  \u2022 The national average sale price advanced by 5.7% y-o-y.\n\nHome sales via Canadian MLS\u00ae Systems posted their fifth consecutive monthly increase in December 2017, fully recovering from the slump last summer.\n\nActivity in December was up in close to 60% of all local markets, led by the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Edmonton, Calgary, the Fraser Valley, Vancouver Island, Hamilton-Burlington and Winnipeg.\n\nActual (not seasonally adjusted) activity was up 4.1% from December 2016. While activity remained below year-ago levels in the GTA, the decline there was more than offset by some sizeable y-o-y gains in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Vancouver Island, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa and Montreal.\n\n\u201cMonthly momentum for national home sales activity gained strength late last year and further expected economic and job growth will buoy sales activity this year despite slightly higher expected interest rates,\u201d said CREA President Andrew Peck. \u201cEven so, momentum for home sales differs depending on location and type,\u201d he added. \u201cA professional REALTOR\u00ae is your best source for information and guidance in negotiations to purchase or sell a home during these changing times,\u201d said Peck.\n\n\u201cNational home sales in December were likely boosted by seasonal adjustment factors and a potential pull-forward of demand before new mortgage regulations came into effect this year,\u201d said Gregory Klump, CREA\u2019s Chief Economist. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if monthly sales activity continues to rise despite tighter mortgage regulations that took effect on January 1st.\u201d\n\nThe number of newly listed homes rose 3.3% in December. As in November, the national increase was overwhelmingly due to rising new supply in the GTA.\n\nNew listings and sales have both trended higher since August. As a result, the sales-to-new listings ratio has remained in the mid-to-high 50% range since then.\n\nA national sales-to-new listings ratio of between 40% and 60% is generally consistent with a balanced national housing market, with readings below and above this range indicating buyers\u2019 and sellers\u2019 markets respectively. That said, the balanced range can vary among local markets.\n\nConsidering the degree and duration that the current market balance is above or below its long-term average is a more sophisticated way of gauging whether local housing market conditions favour buyers or sellers.\n\nMarket balance measures that are within one standard deviation of the long-term average are generally consistent with balanced market conditions.\n\nBased on a comparison of the sales-to-new listings ratio with its long-term average, more than two-thirds of all local markets were in balanced market territory in December 2017.\n\nThe number of months of inventory is another important measure of the balance between housing supply and demand. It represents how long it would take to liquidate current inventories at the current rate of sales activity.\n\nThere were 4.5 months of inventory on a national basis at the end of December 2017. The measure has been moving steadily lower in tandem with the monthly rise in sales that began last summer.\n\nThe number of months of inventory in the Greater Golden Horseshoe region (2.1 months) was up sharply from the all-time low reached in March 2017 (0.9 months). Even so, the December reading stood a full month below the region\u2019s long-term average (3.1 months) and reached a seven-month low.\n\nThe Aggregate Composite MLS\u00ae HPI rose by 9.1% y-o-y in December 2017. This was the 8th consecutive deceleration in y-o-y gains, continuing a trend that began in the spring. It was also the smallest y-o-y increase since February 2016.\n\nThe deceleration in y-o-y price gains largely reflects trends among Greater Golden Horseshoe housing markets tracked by the index, particularly for single-family homes. On an aggregate\n\nbasis, only single-family price increases slowed on a y-o-y basis. By comparison, y-o-y price gains picked up for townhouse\/row and apartment units.\n\nApartment units again posted the largest y-o-y price gains in December (+20.5%), followed by townhouse\/row units (+13%), one-storey single family homes (+5.5%), and two-storey single family homes (+4.5%).\n\nBenchmark home prices were up from year-ago levels in 9 of the 13 markets tracked by the MLS\u00ae HPI, with Calgary and Oakville-Milton price comparisons tipping slightly into negative territory on a y-o-y basis.\n\nAfter having dipped in the second half of last year, composite benchmark home prices in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia have recovered and now stand at new highs (Greater Vancouver: +15.9% y-o-y; Fraser Valley: +20.9% y-o-y).\n\nBenchmark home prices rose by about 14% on a y-o-y basis in Victoria and by about 19% elsewhere on Vancouver Island in December. These y-o-y gains were similar to those recorded in October and November.\n\nPrice gains have slowed considerably on a y-o-y basis in the GTA, Guelph and Oakville-Milton; however, home prices in the former 2 markets remain above year-ago levels (Greater Toronto: +7.2% y o-y; Guelph: +13.1% y-o-y; Oakville-Milton: -0.8% y-o-y).\n\nCalgary benchmark home prices were down slightly in December (-0.4% y-o-y), as were home prices in Regina and Saskatoon (-4% y-o-y and -3.7% y-o-y, respectively).\n\nBenchmark home prices rose by 6.6% y-o-y in Ottawa (led by a 7.5% increase in two-storey single family home prices), by 5.4% in Greater Montreal (led by a 6.3% increase in in two-storey single family home prices) and by 6.3% in Greater Moncton (led by an 8.3% increase in one-storey single family home prices). (Table 1)\n\nThe MLS\u00ae Home Price Index (MLS\u00ae HPI) provides the best way of gauging price trends because average price trends are prone to being strongly distorted by changes in the mix of sales activity from one month to the next.\n\nThe actual (not seasonally adjusted) national average price for homes sold in December 2017 was just over $496,500, up 5.7% from one year earlier. The national average price is heavily skewed by sales in Greater Vancouver and the GTA, two of Canada\u2019s most active and expensive markets. Excluding these two markets from calculations trims almost $116,000 from the national average price to just under $381,000.\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The information contained in this news release combines both major market and national sales information from MLS\u00ae Systems from the previous month.\u00a0\n\nCREA cautions that average price information can be useful in establishing trends over time, but does not indicate actual prices in centres comprised of widely divergent neighbourhoods or account for price differential between geographic areas.

Now that January is here, I can share the many beautiful holiday quilts and pillows that were made!\u00a0 In this newsletter, I will be highlighting two very special military quilts that honor two very special servicemen. All Memory Quilts tell unique stories.\u00a0 That is what makes them so special. Military quilts are so very special because they illustrate the dedication of our servicemen and women.\u00a0 Adding uniforms from men and women who have served our country is an honor and one that I don't take lightly.\u00a0\u00a0 Also highlighted are the 28 holiday quilts that were made! Over 45 years worth of memories are included in these quilts and that is simply amazing and beautiful!\n\nI hope you enjoy the photos and the important stories that are illustrated through fabric.\u00a0 As always, if you are interested in a Memory Quilt please contact me ASAP so that I can add you to the list! NOW is the time to order graduation quilts. Currently, I have 17 quilts in the queue, eight are for graduation.\n\nWarm wishes for a wonderful 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoose Bumps\n\nI get goose bumps when I receive pictures of happy customers enjoying their Memory Quilts! Meet Denny, the lucky man who received a full size, Modern style Memory Quilt made with shirts that span over 30 years. The shirts are from his entire family including his son Denny, daughter Rochelle, and granddaughter Rayna! As you can see from the picture, Denny likes his quilt! Here is what he had to say:\n\n\"Words cannot explain how much I appreciate Rochelle doing this for me and for the love and effort you put in to such a beautiful work of art...not just a quilt. I was Mr. Mom for several years and my kids (Denny and Rochelle) were my life. While Denny is no longer here you have helped keep his spirit alive and added such a special blessing. God Bless.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis United States Marine Quilt was made in honor of Corporal Dane Freedman.\u00a0\n\n\nPeace of Mind\n\n\u00a0The queen size Modern style Memory Quilt shown above is made up of over 60 garments. Dane's uniforms, his fatigues, his special t-shirts, and even his bathing suit all are included in this Memorial Quilt.\nCorporal Dane Freedman served in the United States Marine Corp. from\u00a0 2007-2011.

These uniforms are over 45 years old! Appliqued onto these blocks are his Navy stripes and the ship patches from the sleeves of these uniforms. The ships he sailed on were the USS America and the USS Saratoga.\nThis quilt tells a wonderful story of a man who served his country well and of a loving father and husband who liked the Red Sox and his Harley Davidson motorcycles!\n\nHis daughter received this quilt on Christmas morning. This is what she had to say about her Memory Quilt:\n\"Such a special Christmas gift to receive. My mom had a bunch of my dads old t-shirts made into a quilt for me! This is not only the most beautiful quilt I've ever received, but the most special quilt ever! Not a day goes by that I don't think of him or miss him. I'm just so glad that now I have something that will be a piece of him I'll have forever. Thanks mom! \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily Matters\n\nOn Christmas morning, Nick and his father, Brad, were the lucky recipients of two twin size quilts made with the many t-shirts and baseball shirts that Nick's mom so thoughtfully collected over the years. These shirts represent over twenty years of memories! Nick's childhood is illustrated by his adorable I love daddy hand printed shirt. The two quilts capture Nick's baseball career, beginning with little league and culminating with his baseball career at Emory University.\n\nNick's Modern style quilt is shown above on the fence. His father's Modern style quilt is shown below. Now that's a lot of memories!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGone Running\n\nThis gorgeous lap quilt made in the traditional style with premium sashing is one of my favorites.\u00a0 The marathon shirts are from all over the world-including Hawaii and Paris! The bold backing shown to the right above works beautifully!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLacrosse jerseys are beautiful! Notice the argyle pattern on the jersey to the left.\n\n\nThe Black Bear is the logo for this Lacrosse team. The graphic, including the colorful camouflage design that trimmed the jersey was added to this block.\n\n\n\nShown below is my very first lacrosse Quilt! This large lap quilt made in the traditional style with block sashing includes 16 Lacrosse jerseys and t-shirts from a local Souderton athlete. These jerseys are some of the nicest I have seen.
