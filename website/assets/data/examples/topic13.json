        "text":"Thursday, November 16, 2006\n\nLord Jim\n\nThe classic English sea novel, Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad was 'required reading' in English Literature class aboard my pre-sea cadet training ship many years ago. It was a moving story of an idealistic seaman forced to deal with his act of cowardice and how he ultimately redeems himself. He had abandoned a ship and left the passengers to die. This book was later made into an excellent movie in 1965 starring Peter O'Toole and James Mason.\n\nI didnt even know it was adapted from a true maritime incident involving an early local kapal haji, the S.S. Jeddah until I read the book review below recently. The heroic tale of our jemaah haji overcoming the odds in the face of adversity is forever lost in time and will never be told. It would have made for an interesting, if not truly inspiring reading. Our own great great grandparents could have been on that ship.\n\nBut how times have changed, eh?\n\nPS: The italics and text colouring are mine.\n\n(Movie poster from IMDb Photo Gallery)\n\nAnd you, what are you doing here?\n\nMichael Gilsenan\n\nA Season in Mecca: Narrative of a Pilgrimage by Abdellah Hammoudi ed. Pascale Ghazaleh \u00b7 Polity, 293 pp, \u00a312.99\n\nThe Jeddah sailed from Singapore on 17 July 1880, bound for Penang and Jeddah, with 778 men, 147 women and 67 children on board. Muslims from the Malay Archipelago, they were traveling to Mecca and Medina for the pilgrimage. Some came from the Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia); some from the different Malay states, then beginning to experience more direct British intervention; some from Singapore.\n\nThe ship was under the British flag. Seyyid Muhammad al-Sagoff, the managing director and part-owner of the Singapore Steamship Company, to which it belonged, came from a wealthy Arab family, originally from Hadhramaut in south-east Yemen but already well established in the economy of Singapore and the Hejaz, the region in western Arabia within which lie the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Seyyid Omar al-Sagoff, Muhammad\u2019s son, was on board. In addition to its Singapore office, the business had an important branch in Jeddah, the main port of the Hejaz, then part of the Ottoman Empire. It also ran an agency in Aden, since its conquest in 1839 a key link in British maritime influence in the Indian Ocean, and after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 an even more important port on the Europe-Asia routes. This is the high point of 19th-century imperialism.\n\nAfter terrible weather conditions in the first week of August, the boilers \u2018started adrift from their seatings\u2019. The Jeddah had for some days been taking in water. Now it sprang a heavy leak. The water rose rapidly. The captain and the European officers abandoned the settling and heavily listing ship, taking Seyyid Omar with them, and were picked up by another vessel and taken to Aden, where they told a story of violent passengers and a foundering ship. The pilgrims were left to their fate, an apparently certain death.\n\nTo much astonishment, however, given reports of its loss, on 8 August another steamship towed the Jeddah into Aden. The pilgrims had survived. They had been abandoned by those meant to protect them. Official inquiries followed into this great scandal of the sea.\n\nOne element in the case that added to the embarrassment as well as the outrage of the European and seafaring communities concerned the conduct of the pilgrims. The Vice-Admiralty Court in Singapore, meeting in September 1881 to consider the amount of salvage to be paid, found that the pilgrims became agitated only when they realised that they were being left to die by the crew. They had not threatened violence as had been alleged in defence of the decision to abandon them. Indeed, the judgment says, they did not use their knives to injure anyone. The master had communicated nothing to them and their \u2018demeanour\u2019 could be quite reasonably accounted for by the realisation that they were being deserted: the master\u2019s leaving the ship \u2018roused the pilgrims to violence in attempting to swamp his boat, and such the Court consider might naturally have been expected from any body of human beings, even Europeans, situated as the pilgrims were\u2019. Moreover, the Malay pilgrims appeared to have acted with great efficiency when it came to working the pumps to clear the ship of water, desperate work they continued when the Jeddah was under tow by the French vessel that had spotted their distress signals. The colonial stereotype of \u2018the Malay\u2019 as \u2018running amok\u2019 when not being the classical \u2018lazy native\u2019 he was held to be by some British authorities could not have been challenged more strongly.\n\nThe moral reversal - natives behaving properly while being betrayed by white men who violated their own codes of the sea - impressed the inquiry and, no doubt, the devourers of the now fast traveling news between Aden and London and Singapore.\n\nThis was the scandal that inspired Conrad, who had landed in Singapore in 1883 after himself being forced to abandon ship, to write Lord Jim etc., etc.,\n\n1 comment:\n\n  1.

The church is historically valuable being an excellent example of a vernacular meeting house in a rural area. It is the oldest surviving church sanctuary in the county of Spartanburg, and practically the ?mother church? of many Methodist churches in the locale.\n\nThe site may have been almost two centuries old now, but the area is spectacularly intact. The Shiloh Methodist Church building in itself was never altered to accommodate electrical wirings and plumbing, allowing it to really keep its integrity even after all this time.\n\nThe Shiloh Methodist Church is a part of the National Register of Historic Places. Although, still continuously being preserved, the site is only used for ?Homecoming? services which are held annually.\nEdit Article\n\nShiloh Methodist Church Pictures Add Picture\n\nShiloh Methodist Church Videos Add Video",

First, it\nprovides a thoughtful synthesis of area archaeology. Second,\nit had been reviewed and accepted for publication well over a\nyear ago; however, the letter notifying the author of that fact\nand the accompanying edited text apparently were lost in the\nmail. It was not until a year later when I chanced to ask Mr.\nWheeler why he had chosen not to submit his final text for\npublication that we discovered the problem. Fortunately,\nRyan still had the original text on electronic media, I was able\nto provide him with my photocopy of the edited document,\nand he promptly responded with a final text and diskette.\nMr. Wheeler is currently working on a comparative\nanalysis of decorated bone artifacts from Florida, as part of\nhis graduate studies. I hope that he will publish at least part\nof his results in a future issue of The Florida Anthropologist.\nAny of our readers who have found decorated bone artifacts\nare encouraged to send photographs or slides of those\nartifacts, along with a description of the dimensions, site\nlocation information, and so forth, to Mr. Wheeler. His\naddress may be found at the end of his Riviera Complex\nThe second article, \"The Overgrown Road Site (8Gu38):\nA Swift Creek Camp Site in the Lower Apalachicola Valley,\"\nby Nancy Marie White illustrates the results of carefully\nexcavating a small archaeological site, and the contribution\nwhich such sites can make toward furthering our\nunderstanding of area history and prehistory. As she notes,\nmost previous archaeological efforts have focused on larger\nsites with a wealth of archaeological materials, or on burial\nsites with more complete artifacts. However, in respect for\nthe wishes of Native Americans, Dr. White and other\narchaeologists now generally forego excavation of human\nburial sites unless they are threatened with loss to erosion or\nThis is but one of the many sites located and evaluated\nby Dr. White during her more than ten years of focused\nresearch on the Apalachicola River drainage system. Most of\nthis research has been conducted as summer field schools and\nshe has included a fair mix of volunteers -- time, space,\nequipment, and circumstances permitting. Many of her\nstudents have gone on to become professional archaeologists,\nand her public archaeology efforts are to be lauded as an\nexample for others. One product of Dr. White's public\n\narchaeology effort is a recently published 33-page booklet,\nApalachicola Valley Archaeology (1992) by Nancy White,\nTerry Simpson and Suella McMillan.\nThe third article, \"Analysis of Lithic Materials from the\nRattlesnake Midden Site (8HI980), Tampa Bay, Florida,\" by\nRichard W. Estabrook and J. Raymond Williams reports on\none aspect of a field school project conducted to aid\nHillsborough County in planning the development of a public\npark being developed for passive recreation, environmental\npreservation purposes.

        "text":"In the Scheme of Things: Those Who Came\n\nI was born in Montana, left as a toddler, returning in my fifth decade for a second act career as a writer. It was then I first met and worked with Native Americans. Previously, I hadn\u2019t known anyone who didn\u2019t have an arriving-to-America story in their family history.\n\nWhile many of us have relatives, perhaps generations ago, who made a conscious decision to come to this country, that\u2019s not true for everyone, of course. A few people were already here, some tagged along as children, and others were brought against their will.\n\nAlong my life\u2019s way, growing up in California, attending graduate school in Michigan, raising a family in Pennsylvania, living in the Rocky Mountain states of Montana and Colorado, I\u2019ve heard hundreds of why-we-came stories from people I knew personally.\n\nSome stories are fresh with tears and struggles, others generations old where details have been lost or blurred. But the why seems to remain. On my mother\u2019s side, they came for religious freedom; on my father\u2019s a chance for a better life. Like many immigrant stories, my ancestors arrived with little more than hope, courage, and uncertainty.\n\nA picture sits on my desk to remind me of what it must take to leave behind everyone you love and venture into a strange land where you might not even speak the language. People come here to make a better life, enjoy rights and freedoms, or escape unthinkable hardships.\n\nI found that picture in a tattered, moldy box when cleaning out a shed at my parent\u2019s house. It\u2019s a picture of my great grandfather as a young man of 18 or l9, with three of his brothers. He arrived from Germany in the mid l800s, settling on the plains of South Dakota.\n\nJust as fables and fairy tales help children learn about the world, others\u2019 life stories and struggles help us appreciate who we are as a nation, weaving America\u2019s tapestry with strength, dreams, determination, talent, and diversity.\n\nIn the scheme of things, it seems to me, if we close our hearts to those who seek what my great grandfather sought, or yours, our tapestry of hope, compassion, freedom, and opportunity, woven collectively for centuries by our diverse ancestors \u2014 some legal, some not; some arriving by choice and some not \u2014 begins to unravel. I try to remember this: just two percent of us can claim their family was always here; descendants of the original peoples of these lands.\n\nIn these complex times, I can\u2019t help picturing my elderly mother at the Statue of Liberty. One of the bucket items we helped her cross off after my father died, was a visit to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. She wanted to see what her ancestors saw, touch the ground they touched, and spiritually thank those who came before for creating the life she enjoyed. May that symbol of freedom and hope be a reminder to us of our own immigrant histories, and always be a welcoming light to the world.\n\nSorry, comments and trackbacks have now been closed.",
