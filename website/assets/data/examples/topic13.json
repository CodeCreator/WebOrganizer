        "text":"Greens Moor Quarry\n\nI don\u2019t know the West Pennines very well. In fact, I can only recall four visits although there must have been a few more. Deep-sided urbanised valleys dividing large tracts of very boggy, and I mean very boggy moorland. The road signs on the way north from the M62 jogged memories of fell running clubs that were always ahead of me in results. Rochdale, Bolton, Bury and Rossendale. The Rossendale Valley is oddly named, after all a dale is a valley. And it is the River Irwell that flows down the valley on its way to Manchester and the River Mersey. One of the major industries in Rossendale has been quarrying the gritstone notably in the form of flagstones for flooring, pavements, railway platforms and docksides. Trafalgar Square is paved with Rossendale flags. The industry still flourishes, carving a large gash in the hillside. Greens Moor Quarry is now disused though and has been developed into a popular mountain bike centre called the Valley of Stone with many constructed trails. One thing I did notice was the absence of plastic bottles, beers cans and burnt-out cars. Quite a comparison with our own Eston Hills.

        "text":"American Clarity Add us on facebook:\n\n17. March 2013\n\nHeritage as a matter of the will\n\nFiled under: history,worldview \u2014 admin @ 10:51\n\nEditor\u2019s note: a version of this article appeared on The American Thinker, but was so badly mangled and inferior to the original, I request that the reader \u2014 if he has any appreciation of my writing \u2014 please read this version either instead, or as well.\n\nLook closely at those two words, heritage and destiny, dear reader, and see at once two concepts entirely different, and yet intimately connected: the former, what we have been, and the latter, what we will be \u2014 and yet, if we simply describe heritage as what we have been, the latter, what we will be, risks much loss.\n\nFor heritage, simply put, is not a series of historical happenstances \u2014 dead, a record of what once was. \u00a0 What once was is far better known as history.\u00a0 But rather, knowing that any man may read history books and place them back on the shelf, heritage is something far different \u2014 alive, something inherited and maintained; a story propagated not simply by happenstance, but by a matter of the will.\u00a0 In short, heritage isn\u2019t simply something we know about our ancestors, but something of theirs we want to keep; and if we do not want it, we do not keep it.\n\nFor reasons of sanity, here must be distinguished two different types of heritage: universal and particular, for only the latter is forfeitable.\u00a0 For knowing that every man\u2019s story is different, that his forefathers\u2019 crimes and honors and struggles have begotten different microcosms of humanity with different manifestations of society both good and evil (that is to say, particular to certain persons and exclusive of others), mankind also has a common heritage, uniting black and white, male and female, civilized and barbarian alike: man\u2019s creation in the image of God, his forfeiture of Eden, and his inevitable journey back to the Great White Throne.\u00a0 Within universal heritage is encompassed a basic and foundational knowledge of the self and fellow man, without which no truly eternal brotherhood can possibly exist, without which there can be no unalienable rights and duties, and without which man\u2019s entire existence reduces him to an accident without hope, without glory, and without future. Universal heritage may be ignored, but never escaped: men may and should be held accountable according to it by other men, and will be held accountable to it by God.\n\nBut, seeing that the second lesser kind of heritage, the particular, is a matter of the will \u2014 morally subject to universal heritage, and maintained or forfeited by willing participants \u2014 it becomes necessary to distinguish between what must be propagated, and what must be abandoned.\u00a0 For if men propagate the injustices of ancestors, not only error, but perpetual guilt and shame become an inheritance, damning posterity upon arrival and creating an injustice of another nature: children perpetually punished for the sins of fathers, a spiritual prison without walls for the containment of souls \u2014 undeserved and irrational dishonor.\u00a0 If heritage were simply a matter of recycling history and repeating it as a form of ancestor worship, it could serve no moral or practical purpose, becoming a religion of anti-transcendentalism in which man could not only never rise above what he currently was, but also never above what dead men had already accomplished.\n\nTherefore, seeing that particular heritage \u2014 if it is to be beneficial (that\u2019s to say, an object of pursuit at all) \u2014 must be a transmission of wisdom and goodness, and a forfeiture of follies and evils, we find ourselves not only in need of an eternal standard by which to progress (a moral compass provided by the universal heritage), but of children willing to carry forward particular banners; children who not only know what good their ancestors have done, but those who feel romantically inclined toward its perpetuation.\u00a0 For whatever certain men say of the will \u2014 wrongly, that it is a sovereign act committed by an impartial soul \u2014 we must recognize that the will is nothing more than desire and potential combined: men will only what they want, and if they do not want it, they do not will it (as said above).\u00a0 And thus we may say that in the perpetuation of heritage, two duties exist: the young have a duty to accept what is good; the aged have a duty to present what is good as living and desirable.\n\nIf the presentation of heritage is the duty of parents, what failures may we accuse the present generations of!\u00a0 What negligence!\u00a0 What willful ignorance in an age of unprecedented information!\u00a0 To paint their greatest of ancestors with the hastily penciled lines of soulless history textbooks instead of carving statues of marble and gold!\u00a0 To have given their children to teachers and professors, whose pathetic moral constitutions and self-loathing permeate entire classrooms, who smother glory under avalanches of guilt, and make children hate their own identity!\u00a0 Heritage inverted \u2014 this is the inheritance of the modern American, the glorious story exchanged for something worse than nothing, a propagation of perpetual guilt and discord; not a future to be gained, but a past to be lost; a people to be forgotten.\u00a0 If heritage is an act of the will, then is ours likely to be handed to the next generation?\u00a0 To children whose heritage comprises the ugliest they know, whose shame in Fathers exceeds their pride, whose story is felt to be better left untold?\n\nCursed are children without a heritage \u2014 much more those whose heritage is worth keeping, but thrown away; but cursed still more are the parents of those children, who thought the greatest achievements of man not worth celebrating, whose hearts never beat wildly when reading of Hale, Henry, Washington, and Paine \u2014 Abraham and Moses and David and Jesus; who count\u00a0the propagation of true religion and enlightenment and virtue less valuable than Monday Night Football \u2014 glory exchanged for entertainment!\u00a0 Dead souls! \u2014 walking, but lifeless, spineless, heartless; with no future but to die clutching to an increasingly irrelevant and dwindling \u201cconservatism\u201d on life-support!\u00a0 To a series of rules for the purpose of production, and little more!\n\nIt may be said that the current fiasco \u2014 a Republican party predominantly (though not entirely) filled with sellouts and establishment fat cats, and the Democratic party with traitors and villains \u2014 may be a manifestation of our forgetfulness. \u00a0 But if heritage is an act of the will, then let us pick up our books \u2014 old books, written by long-dead men \u2014 and start afresh.\u00a0 Let us look upon the current era not as heritage, but as a stain in the pages of Western Civilization; as a second Dark Ages, a soul-smothering progressive Papacy before the Renaissance and Reformation; as sins of fathers committed, but soon abandoned for lack of perpetuation.\u00a0 Let us go back and fall in love with the great men of Greece and Rome, to pick up dusty banners, to celebrate the excitement of virtuous martyrs and the dangers of liberty \u2014 to wet our eyes and cheeks before old gravestones as though heroes passed only yesterday, and reclaim what is ours, and no soul can forfeit but us, and then only if we choose.\n\nIf the above essay may be summarized in a short sentence, let it be this: if heritage is a matter of the will, let us then will to have great heritage \u2014 first, in the divine, second, by the moral triumphs of our great and glorious Western Civilization.\n\nNo Comments\n\nNo comments yet.\n\nRSS feed for comments on this post.\n\nSorry, the comment form is closed at this time.\n\nPowered by WordPress",

Harris\n\nPractices of Archaeological Stratigraphy brings together a number of examples which illustrate the development and use of the Harris Matrix in describing and interpreting archaeological sites. This matrix, the theory of which is described in two editions of the previous book by Harris, Principles of Archaeological Stratigaphy, made possible for the first time a simple diagramatic representation of the strategraphic sequence of a site, no matter how complex. The Harris Matrix, by showing in one diagram all three linear dimensions, plus time, represents a quantum leap over the older methods which relied on sample sections only.\nIn this book 17 essays present a sample of new work demonstrating the strengths and uses of the Harris Matrix, the first ever published collection of papers devoted solely to stratigraphy in archaeology. The crucial relationships between the Harris methods, open-area excavation techniques, the interpretation of interfaces, and the use of single-context plans and recording sheets, is clarified by reference to specific sites. These sites range from medieval Europe, through Mayan civilizations to Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.\nThis book will be of great value to all those involved in excavating and recording archaeological sites and should help to ensure that the maximum amount of stratigraphic information can be gathered from future investigations.\n\n* Presents case studies which illuminate the Harris matrix method, invented by Edward C.

        "text":"Mar 202013\nHMS Stubborn\n\nThe Dive:\u00a0\nThe HMS Stubborn was scuttled in April 1945 after she was hit from a depth charge and lost her tail fin. Stubborn has dived down to 166m exceeding the limit depth of 90m because of this she has damage the hull distortion. Royal Navy scuttled the sub for ASDIC target, training naval officers listening on sonar devices to detect the presence of submarines.\n\nThis is a decompression dive and has to be done by boat. The wreck is in mint condition with lots of fish around it, penetration is very difficult and not recommended.\n\n\nLocation of Site:\u00a0\n2.4miles off Qawra Point : The wrecks co-ordinates are of N 35\u2019 58.950 \/\/ E 014\u2019 26.760\nType of Dive:\nThis dive has to be done via a boat dive. Descent and ascent only using a shot line which should be touching the wreck. Should the shot line not be touching the wreck but is visible from the shotline, you are in danger of making an ascent in the blue. For this type of dive, a diver must carry a DSMB and Reel\n\nMaximum Depth:\u00a058metres\n\nMinimum Certification:\n\nTechnical or very experienced divers.\n\n\nBe sure to go down the shot line directly connected to the wreck and you also make the ascent using the shot line as your reference point. If for any reasons the shot line is not on the wreck but it is within visible range, you are in danger of making an open water ascent. For safety reasons divers should carry a DSMB and reel in the eventuality that the diver does not find the shot line and must make an ascent into the blue\n\nWreck History :\n\n\nBuilt by Cammell Laird & Co of Birkenhead UK & Launched on 11 Nov 1942 these 66 meters long S-Class submarine pennant number \u2018P238\u2019 was armed with 13 x 21 inch torpedoes. She has 6 bow torpedo tubes & 1 stern tube, 1 x 3\u201d Gun in front of the conning tower and 1 x 20mm Oerlikon machine gun at the back. She had a crew of 44\/48 under the command of Lieutenant Duff and later on in 1944 under Lieutenant Davies.\n\nShe served in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and had her share of difficult times in these cold waters which instigated submariners\u2019 fear on many occasions . In April 1945 a year before she was finally scuttled off Qawra Point, HMS Stubborn sailed into Malta for the first time en route to the Suez and eventually to the Far East where she took up patrolling duties with allied Navies in their struggle against the Japanese Navy.\n\n\nIt was at this phase of duty that Stubborn suffered its worst attack of the war and lost her complete tail fin which held the after hydroplanes and rudder. This loss was caused by depth charges but principally from hitting the sea bottom at 166 meters. S- Class submarines are only designed to dive to a max depth of 90 meters.\n\n\nDuring the return voyage from Australia it became evident that the hull aft had suffered more distortion than was originally thought. Stubborn called back to Malta for her second and last time. As she was not fit to repair, she was stripped down from important equipment, instruments, armaments & periscopes before sent to her watery grave and used for ASDIC target, training naval officers listening on sonar devices to detect the presence of submarines.\n\n\nHMS Stubborn lies at a depth of 56 meters 1.6 miles off Qawra Point. It is in a magnificent condition lying upright with a 10 degree list toward starboard side. The three escape hatches are open. It is very difficult to enter inside; the widest hatch is only 60 cms in diameter with heavy sedimentation inside. S-Class submarines were designed as a replacement for the H-Class and they proved so successful a design that production of this class was re-started on the outbreak of war and continued until end of hostilities. Continual modifications were made to the vessels during the war.\n\n\nA total of 67 S-Class submarines were build, 29 of them were sold for scrap, 20 were lost during the war, 12 were sold to other navies and again were cut down for scrap iron, 4 were cancelled on construction and were never build and 2 were scuttled one of these is HMS Stubborn\n\n\nA team of divers first relocated Stubborn on 24\/7\/94. Although charted the wreck was found 200 meters off current charted position. Prior to 1994 nobody from the Maltese diving community knew that such a magnificent wreck existed so close to the Maltese shores.",

This battery was raised in Laporte, Porter and Lake counties and was mustered in at Indianapolis, Sept. 30, 1861. It was immediately ordered to Louisville, Ky., where it joined Gen. Buell's army. During the winter it remained in camp in the vicinity of New Haven, Munfordville and Bowling Green and in the spring of 1862 moved with Buell to Nashville. It next marched to Savannah, Tenn., but was unable to cross the river in time to take part in the battle of Shiloh. It participated in the campaign through northern Alabama and middle Tennessee following the siege of Corinth, reaching Nashville late in August. Proceeding to Louisville at the time of Bragg's invasion, it accompanied Rousseau's division and took part in the campaign that drove Bragg's forces from the state, being in the battle of Perryville, where it was one of two batteries to occupy a high ridge on Rousseau's left, its work aiding materially in saving the left of McCook's corps and securing to the army the Mackville road, upon which stood the entire ammunition train and ambulances. Upon its return to Nashville it was assigned to the 3d division of McCook's corps, Gen. Sheridan being the division commander. At the battle of Stone's river it performed heroic service, driving an opposing battery to cover the first day, then moved across an open field and shelled a battery in the woods for two hours, silencing it, the enemy losing half his horses, a gun disabled, 1 lieutenant and 12 men killed and several wounded, besides a number of the supporting infantry. The 4th lost 4 killed and 3 wounded. The following day it was in a hot engagement, losing a caisson through having every horse drawing it shot down while falling back to take a new position. Later it lost 2 guns, the infantry driving past with such rapidity as to force them to one side, 1 gun being fastened in the trees and nearly all the horses killed by a battery posted but 40 yards away. Having exhausted its ammunition it moved to the rear, obtained a supply and reported again for duty with 3 pieces. It was in position the following day, losing in the 3 days' battle 6 killed, and 17 wounded, 2 paroled by the enemy and 1 missing. It was encamped near Murfreesboro until June, 1863, then moved on the Tullahoma campaign and was engaged at Hoover's gap. It was next engaged at Dug gap and at the battle of Chickamauga, where it rendered effective service. It took part in the battles of Lookout mountain and Missionary ridge, and was then stationed at Chattanooga until Sept. 21, 1864, at which time the reenlisted veterans and recruits were transferred to the 7th battery, with which they remained until its muster-out. The non-veterans were mustered out at Indianapolis on Oct. 6, 1864, with Benjamin F. Johnson as captain. It joined the army of the Cumberland at Nashville, and after the battle at that place was assigned as garrison of Fort Rosecrans, Murfreesboro, remaining there until mustered out Aug. 1, 1865.\n\nRegimental history taken from \"The Union Army\" by Federal Publishing Company, 1908 - Volume 3\n\nWhats New\nAbout Us\n\nCustom Search\n\nCopyright 2010 by\nA Division of",

        "text":"Narrative of the overland expedition of the, by F. and A. Jardine\n\n\nA description of the settlement at Port Albany, Cape York, at the time of the arrival of the Brothers has been carefully drawn up in the shape of a report to the Colonial Secretary of Queensland by Mr. Jardine. It is so full and interesting that I cannot do better than publish it in extenso. It first appeared in the \u2018Queensland Daily Guardian\u2019 of 24th June, 1865. A letter from Mr. Jardine to Sir George Bowen, reporting the arrival of the sons, and epitomising the events of the journey, together with the report of Dr. Haran, R.N., Surgeon in charge of the detachment of Royal Marines, on the climate of Cape York, showing its great salubrity, are also added:\u2014\n\n\nSomerset, March 1st, 1865.\n\nSir, \u2014 My former reports to you having been, to a certain extent, necessarily taken up with matters of detail in reference to the formation of the new settlement of Somerset, and that object being now in such a state of completion as to enable me to say that it is fairly established, so far as the comfort and safety of the present residents are concerned, I now do myself the honor to lay before you the result of such general observations as I have been able to make on what may be termed general matters of interest.\n\n2. The portion of the country to which my observations will particularly apply is that which, I think, may correctly be termed the \u201cYork Peninsula proper,\u201d and comprises the land lying to the northward of a line drawn from the estuary of the Kennedy River, at the head of Newcastle Bay, to the opposite or north-west coast. The general course of the Kennedy River runs in this line, and from the head of the tideway to the north-west coast the breadth of land does not exceed six miles. The mouth of the river falling into the sea a short distance to the southward of Barn Island will be nearly met by the western extremity of this line.\n\n3. The land on the neck thus formed presents singular features. There is no defined or visible water shed; a succession of low irregular ridges, divided by swampy flats, extends from coast to coast, and the sources of the streams running into either overlap in a most puzzling manner. The large ant-hills which are spread over the whole of this country may be taken as sure indicators of the nature of the soils; on the ridges a reddish sandy loam, intermixed with iron-stone gravel, prevails; on the flats a thin layer of decomposed vegetable matter overlays a white sand, bearing \u2018Melaleuca\u2019 and \u2018Pandanus\u2019, with a heavy undergrowth of a plant much resembling tall heath. Nearly every flat has its stream of clear water; the elegant \u201cpitcher\u201d plant grows abundantly on the margins. The timber is poor and stunted, chiefly bloodwood and \u2018grevillea\u2019; and the grass is coarse and wiry.\n\n4. Leaving this neck of barren and uninteresting country, the land to the northward rises, and a distinct division or spine is formed, ending in Cape York. From it, on either side, spurs run down to the coast, frequently ending in abrupt precipices overhanging the sea; in other places gradually declining to the narrow belt of flat land which occasionally borders the shore. The formation is, I may say, entirely sandstone, overlaid in many places by a layer of lava-like ironstone. Porphyry occurs occasionally in large masses, split and standing erect in large columns, at a distance resembling basalt. The sandstone is of the coarsest quality, almost a conglomerate, and is soft and friable; exposure to the air might probably harden it if quarried, when it would be available for rough building. The ridges, with very few exceptions, are topped with large blocks of ferruginous sandstone, irregularly cast about, and are covered with a thick scrub, laced and woven together with a variety of vines and climbers, while the small valleys intervening bear a strong growth of tall grass, through which numerous creeping plants twine in all directions, some of them bearing beautiful flowers. Among them I may particularise two species of \u2018Ipomea\u2019, which I believe to be undescribed, and a vine-like plant, bearing clusters of fruit much resembling in appearance black Hambro Grapes, wholesome and pleasant to the taste. The scrubs are formed of an immense variety of trees and shrubs, far too numerous for me to name, were I able to do so. Some of them have fine foliage, and bear handsome flowers and agreeably tasted fruit, and would form most ornamental additions to our southern gardens and pleasure grounds. Several species of the numerous climbing plants produce a fine and strong fibre, from which the natives make their fishing lines. Some fine varieties of palm are found on the moister lands near the creeks, two especially elegant, a \u2018Seaforthia\u2019 and a \u2018Caryota\u2019. A wild banana, with small but good fruit, is also found in such localities. On the open grounds the bloodwood, Moreton Bay ash, and a strong growing acacia are the principal trees. Timber for building is scarce, and of very indifferent quality. The iron-bark and pine are unknown here.\n\n5. The soil on these grounds is a reddish loam, more or less sandy, and thinly covered with a coarse ironstone gravel. Much of the ironstone has a strong magnetic property \u2014 so much so as to suspend a needle; and it was found a great inconvenience by Mr. Surveyor Wilson, from its action on the instruments. As the land descends, the soil becomes more sandy. Near the creek patches with a considerable mixture of vegetable loam are found, which would be suitable for the growth of vegetables, bananas, etc. The grass is generally long and coarse, and soon after the rainy season ceases becomes, under the influence of the strong south-east winds, withered and dry. Horses and cattle keep their condition fairly, but sheep do not thrive; the country is quite unsuited to them. Goats may be kept with advantage; and pigs find an abundant supply of food in the scrubs and swamps.\n\n6. In the Zoology of the district, the careful researches of Mr. M\u2019Gillivray \u2014 the naturalist attached to H.M.\u2019s surveying ship Rattlesnake \u2014 have left little room for the discovery of many positive novelties. I have, however, been able to note many interesting facts in the economy and habits of the birds, especially such as relate to their migration. Several of the species found here are season visitors of New South Wales, and it is interesting to compare the times of their arrival and departure in this place with those in the southern colony.\n\n7. The animals afford small variety. The dingo, or native dog, four species of the smaller kangaroos, and two other marsupials are found. One, an elegant little squirrel-like opossum, striped lengthways with black and white, I believe to be new.\n\n8. The birds are more plentiful. My collection comprises more than one hundred species of land birds, many of them remarkable for beauty of plumage, and peculiarity of form, structure, and habit. Among them the most remarkable are the great black macaw, (\u2019Microglossus Atterrimus\u2019) the magnificent rifle bird, (\u2019Ptiloris Magnifica\u2019) and the rare and beautiful wood kingfisher, (\u2019Tan Ts-ptera Sylvia\u2019). The latter first made its appearance here on the 30th of November last. On the afternoon and night of the 28th and the 29th of that month there was a heavy storm of rain, with wind from the north-east, and the next morning the bush along the shore was ringing with the cries of the new arrivals. To my constant enquiries of the blacks for this bird, I was always told by them that when the wind and rain came from the north-west the birds would come, and their prediction was verified to the letter. They also say the birds come from \u201cDowdui\u201d (New Guinea). I think this probable, as several of the birds described by the French naturalist, M. Lesson, as found by him in New Guinea have also appeared here for the breeding season. The \u2018Megapodius Tumulus\u2019 is also worthy of mention, on account of the surprising structure of its nest. The mound resembles, and is composed of the same materials as that of the brush turkey (\u2019Talegulla\u2019), but is very much larger in size. Some that I have measured are upwards of thirty (30) feet in diameter at the base, and rise at the natural angle to a height of fifteen (15) feet or more. It is wonderful how birds so comparatively diminutive can accumulate so large a pile. These birds live in pairs, and several pairs use the same mound. The eggs are deposited at a depth of from one to three feet; the heat at that depth is very great, more than the hand can bear for any length of time. I cannot say whether the young, when released from the mounds, are tended by the parents; they, however, return and roost in the mounds at night. The flesh of the \u2018Megapodius\u2019 is dark and flavorless, being a mass of hard muscle and sinew. birds, which may be called game, are not numerous. The brush turkey (\u2019Talegalla\u2019), the \u2018Megapodius\u2019, several species of pigeon, with a few ducks and quail, comprise the whole.\n\n9. \u2014 Fish are in abundance, and in great varieties; some of them of strange form and singular brilliancy of coloring. The grey mullet, the bream \u2014 a fish much resembling in general appearance the English pike \u2014 and several others, are excellent eating.\n\n10. \u2014 Three species of turtle are plentiful during the season, that is, the period when they approach the shores to deposit their eggs, the green, the hawksbill, and another species, which grow to a much larger size than either of the above. The natives take large numbers of the former; indeed, from the month of November till February turtle forms their principal food. The green turtle are taken in the water by the blacks, who display great address in \u201cturning\u201d them; they are approached when asleep on the surface; the black slips gently from his canoe and disappears under water, and rising beneath the animal, by a sudden effort turns it on its back, and by a strong wrench to the fore flipper disables it from swimming. The fisherman is assiste... (truncated)",

        "text":"Wednesday, September 05, 2007\n\nThe vara\n\nFun fact for the day.\u00a0 I came across a very bizarre unit of measurement today while considering land surveys in Texas.\u00a0 It seems that while surveyors in most parts of the country rely on feet or chains (go figure), in Texas, and indeed in some other southern states, you might run into the vara.\n\nExample of what it would look like on a survey:\u00a0 \u201cthence N 23 \u00bd W 232 vrs.\u201d\n\nIt turns out the vara is an old Spanish and Portuguese base of measurement imported over to the Americas.\u00a0 When the Spanish system came in contact with the English system during the days of independent Texas, the modern vara was adjusted to make more sense to people who were more used to measuring things in feet.\n\nAlthough, why they didn\u2019t use the English chain, which was much more integrated with feet and miles, is beyond me.\n\nHere\u2019s a history of the Spanish vara:\n\n      The vara, a Spanish unit of distance, was used in the Spanish and Mexican surveys and land grantsqv in Texas. One vara equals approximately thirty-three and one-third inches; 5,645.4 square varas equal one acre; 1,906.1 varas equal one mile; and 1,000,000 square varas, which is one labor,qv equal approximately 177.1 acres. The word vara entered the Spanish language from vulgate Latin and originally meant a long, thin, clean branch of any tree or plant. It later came to be used for any straight stick and then for a lance. Next it came to mean a badge of office carried by mayors and judges and such officials and probably achieved a more uniform dimension. As a judge's lance, the vara assumed a position of official importance in the eyes of the people, began to be used as a measuring stick, and eventually became a unit of measurement.\n\nThe vara is also thought to be the typical length of stride of a Spanish soldier.\nIn Texas, one vara is equal to 33 1\/3 inches, or just less than a yard.\u00a0 1 million square vara equal one square Labor.\u00a0 The Spanish vara was set at 835.9mm in 1801 (that\u2019s about 32.9 inches).\u00a0 The Colorado and California vara are 33 inches and the Florida vara is 33.372.\n\nIn truth, it seems that everywhere in the Spanish world the vara could have been anywhere from 32 to 35 inches in length, causing all kinds of problems.\n\nNo comments:",

        "text":"Bengal Volunteers\n\nThe dreaded Bengal Volunteers was founded by Hemchandra Ghosh, who had started the journey of this organization as Dhaka Mukti Sangha. In April 1901, Hemchandra as a young man came in contact with Swami Vivekananda. When asked about religious discourse, the Swami flared up and said that an enslaved nation had no other religion than to destroy the very power that had enslaved it. He kindled the passion, the fire of fighting for freedom in a group of young men with Hemchandra as one of the key person. Hemchandra was also profoundly influenced by Ananda Math of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, which had outlined the struggle of a group of all renouncing monks against a diabolic and oppressive rule. Hemchandra established a secret society and named it as Dhaka Mukti Sangha. In 1905 he had come in contact with P Mitra, founder of Anushilon Samity. Mukti Sangha obtained many esteemed members which included Alimuddin Ahmed, Dr. Surendra Bardhan, Shrish Pal, Haridas Datta, Khagen Das, Nikunja Sen, Rajen Guha, among others. Shrish Pal assumed the responsibility of the Calcutta branch, assisted by Haridas Datta. Hemchandra had earlier met Aurobindo Ghosh, Sister Nivedita, Bipin Chandra Pal and Satish Chandra Mukherjee. In 1909 he met Bagha Jatin. In 1913 Mukti Sangha volunteers worked very hard in the flood relief work in Bengal. Mukti Sangha coordinated closely with other revolutionary organizations like the Jugantar group of Bagha Jatin and Atmonnati Samity of Bipin Behari Ganguli. One coordinated attack was undertaken in 1909 through the killing of inspector Nandalal Bannerjee by Shrish Pal and Ranen Ganguli. They also wanted to punish engineer O'Brien who had kicked and killed a Bengali clerk over some flimsy issues and was fined a paltry Rs 50 for that offense. Haridas Datta and Khagen Das were entrusted with the job of killing O'Brien to send a strong message to the European community. They worked as ordinary coolie in the jute mill for three months. However the conspiracy was discovered and O'Brien was saved.\u00a0\n\nThe next major milestone in the history of Mukti Sangha was the coordinated heist of the Rodda arms - a consignment of fifty Mauser pistols and cartridges. Shrish Pal and Haridas Datta, ably supported by Shrish (Habu) Mitra were main the architects, while several revolutionary organizations came forward to work together to make this plan a success. Particularly noteworthy were contributions from Atmonnati Samity of Bipin Behari Ganguli.\n\nMukti Sangha revolutionaries had worked closely with the Jugantar group of revolutionaries atleast until 1930s when Jugantar ditched Subhas Chandra Bose to become Gandhivadi.\u00a0\n\nAfter the failure of the Indo German Conspiracy and 1915 revolution of Rashbehari Bose, the British Government came down heavily on the revolutionaries across India. Many young men were interned without any trial, fair or unfair. Hemchandra was sent to jail under the notorious Regulation 3. But by 1920, thanks to Lord Montagu and his reforms, almost all revolutionary leaders and the associates were released and they began to regroup secretly. A small nucleus of a team was retained in Dhaka under Pramatha Choudhury. The old guards who were under the police watchlist had taken temporary retirement from public eyes and pursued life as ordinary folks. By 1920 a whole bunch of new revolutionaries had joined the team - most notable being Satya Gupta, Rasomay Sur, Bhabesh Nandi, Anil Roy, Suren Datta, Prafulla Mukherjee, Manindra Roy, Bhupendra Rakshit Roy and others. This group spread its wings in different districts of Bengal like Dhaka, Calcutta, Kumilla, Medinipur, Mymensingh, 24 Parganas etc. \u00a0The leaders used to meet the members in secret, mostly at night. During daytime the leaders under police watchlist would never interact with the new members so as to protect them from the watchful eyes of the police informers.\u00a0\n\nThe Head Quarter of Mukti Sangha was shifted from Dhaka to Calcutta and Hemchandra and Satyaranjan Bakshi had come to Calcutta. Satyaranjan was entrusted with the job of editing the Forward Patrika of the Swaraj Party.\n\nBy 1922, Mukti Sangha had many branches like Sri Sangha, Shanti Sangha and Dhruba Sangha, all of which were involved in social welfare activities in public and in planning and coordinating revolutionary activities in private, esp. in mentoring the young college going boys and girls.\n\nSri Sangha was founded under the active guidance of Anil Roy in Dhaka. Anil was helped in his activities by Rasomay Sur, Satya Gupta and Suren Datta. They used to conduct welfare activities, developed study circles and brought students to the ideological ambit. They had opened gymnasiums for physical exercises. However all these were subterfuge to hide the real activities, of creating a network of daring youth who would not hesitate to take up any action when time comes. This was also the period when women, coming out of colleges and universities, were equally enthused to participate in the freedom movement. Leela Nag, who had founded Deepali Sangha, was an outstanding woman in every sense. She had formed several schools for the education of women and had engaged herself in social welfare activities. She had come in contact with her classmate and future husband Anil Roy, a philosopher and musician per excellence, and together they had shaped the journey for Sri Sangha. In 1931 she had published the Jayashree patrika, which was blessed by Rabindranath Tagore. The patrika was managed entirely by a crew of women and\u00a0 had actively supported all revolutionary and anti British activities including that of the Chattogram uprising. Leela was sent to jail in 1931 and remained in jail atleast until 1937. She and Anil Roy became close to Subhas Chandra Bose, who as the President of Indian National Congress, had made her a member of the newly formed Planning Commission. After Subhas formed Forward Bloc, Leela and Anil joined him and\u00a0 took part in all his activities, like editing the magazine or participating in the Holwell Monument agitation or facilitating his visit to Dhaka and Narayanganj in May, 1940.\u00a0\n\nIn Medinipur Jyotish Jowardar and Dinesh Gupta had formed a well coordinated network of volunteers who would later play key roles in creating terror in the hearts of the British administration by killing atleast three magistrates. 1928 was a remarkable year in the history of Mukti Sangha as under the guidance of Subhas Chandra Bose it transformed itself into Bengal Volunteers that had played such a key role in organizing the Calcutta Congress of 1928. Under the strict guidance of Major Satya Gupta and Major Jatin Das among others, Bengal Volunteers became a well trained army of dedicated soldiers. The woman's regiment under Latika Bose was a foretaste of the Rani Jhansi Regiment that would come up fifteen years later in Singapore.\u00a0\n\nBy the end of 1928 there was a split in Mukti Sangha and Anil Roy and Leela Nag's Sri Sangha became a separate organization. The split was done mainly to protect Sri Sangha from the Government wrath as a consequence of the revolutionary activities of the parent body. However Anil Roy and his members had maintained a close contact with the parent body and had helped in its activities in various ways. Sri Sangha had among its associates Anil Das, Shailesh Roy, Khitish Roy, Barin Roy, Kamalakanta Ghosh, Rebati Barman, Renu Sen, Amal Roy and Sudheer Nag .\n\nMeera Dutta Gupta was entrusted with the woman's wing of the Mukti Sangha Volunteers. Het father was an influential Government officer. Other notable women revolutionaries were Kamala Dasgupta, Ujjwala Majumdar, Chameli Basu etc. They had inspired several other women to take up arms, the most notable among them being Bina Das, the daughter of Benimadhab Das, who had fired at Governor Stanley Jackson in the Calcutta University Convocation in 1932. Among prominent members of B.V were Sachin Bhowmik, Mani Bhowmik, Sunil Sengupta, Biren Guha Roy, Kumud Mukherjee, Haridas Sen, Comet Dasgupta, Biren Ghosh etc. Dinesh Gupta started organizing a band of dedicated soldiers in Medinipur. Bengal Volunteers had close contact with Anushilon Samity and Jugantar group and with the Chattogram team of Masterda Surjya Sen. Ananta Singh and Loknath Bal were part of B.V in 1928. From Jugantar group Kiran Mukherjee and Bhupendranath Datta had close links with B.V.\u00a0\n\nIn August 1930 Binoy Bose, a Dhaka Medical College student and one of the volunteers, killed Inspector General Lowman and injured the notorious Hudson who had an uncanny ability to instigate riots among Hindus and Muslims. Supati Roy helped Binoy escape from Dhaka to Calcutta. Masterda Surjya Sen led a group of young revolutionaries to declare war on the British Government on 18 April 1930. Subhas Chandra Bose was severely attacked inside the prison and the attack was instigated by Som Datta, the Punjabi IMS officer who was the superintendent of the Alipore prison. The revolutionaries from Jugantar and B.V targeted Som Datta but could not succeed owing to the lack of coordination. Later B.V took up on its shoulder the task of punishing I.G Prison Simpson. Major Binoy Bose, lieutenant Sudheer (Badal) Gupta, and Dinesh Gupta, the three trusted volunteers, were to carry out the operation in Writer's Building on Dec 8, 1930, in what went down in history as the famous Verandah battle where three daring youth took on the whole might of the Empire. After killing Simpson, the trio fought with a large contingent of British military police till their ammunition ran out.

        "text":"The Origination of the Word \u201cCarnival\u201d\n\nSeveral hundred years ago, the followers of the Catholic religion in Italy started the tradition of holding a costume festival right before the first day of Lent. At this time Catholics were not supposed to eat meat during Lent, this festival was called carnevale \u2013 which means \u201cto put away the meat\u201d. As years passed, carnivals in Italy became quite popular and the celebrations spread to France, Spain, and all the Catholic countries in Europe. Then as the French, Spanish, and Portuguese began to take control of the Americas and other parts of the world, they brought with them their tradition of celebrating carnival.\n\nBy the early 19th century, some six million slaves had been brought to the Caribbean. Between 1836 and 1917, indentured workers from Europe, west and central Africa, southern China, and India were brought to the Caribbean as laborers.\n\n\nAfrican Influences on Carnival Traditions\n\nAn important part of Caribbean festivals are the ancient African tradition of parading through villages in costumes and masks. This was believed to bring good fortune and to heal problems within the village. Carnival traditions also borrow from the African tradition of putting together natural objects to create a mask or costume\n\nFeathers were frequently used by Africans on masks and headdresses as a symbol of our ability as humans to rise above pains, heartbreaks, illnesses, and problems. Today, we see feathers used in many ways in creating carnival costumes.\n\nAfrican dance and music traditions transformed the early carnival celebrations in the Americas, as African drum rhythms, large puppets, stick fighters, and stilt dancers began to make their appearances in the carnival festivities.\n\nIn many parts of the world, where Catholic Europeans set up colonies and entered into the slave trade, carnival took root. Brazil is famous for its carnival, as is Mardi Gras in Louisiana (where African-Americans mixed with French settlers and Native Americans). Carnival celebrations are now found throughout the Caribbean in Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, Grenada, Dominica, Haiti, Cuba, St. Thomas, St. Marten; in Central and South America in Belize, Panama, and in Canada and the U.S. where Caribbean people have settled, including Brooklyn, Miami, and Toronto.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\nGet the Facebook Likebox Slider Pro for WordPress",
