I grabbed my camera and tripod, and got to the park early to get an nice spot with a clear view of the show. I set up my camera in bulb mode. I switched my lens into manual focus, and focused at infinity. I raised my aperture quite high and i made sure that my camera was stable and securely positioned.\n\nDiscover more inspiring photos like this one.\n\nDownload the FREE 500px app Open in app",

Many of the artists associated with the photographer and gallery director Alfred Stieglitz explored abstract portraiture in the early decades of the twentieth century. These artists included Marius de Zayas, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, and Stieglitz himself. But beyond a few watercolors made in 1917, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe is not known to have extensively investigated this genre. In this lecture, held on January 22, 2017, at the National Gallery of Art, Sarah Greenough suggests that O\u2019Keeffe made many more abstract portraits than have been previously identified, which have, as she herself admitted in the early 1970s, \u201cslipped into the world as abstractions.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\n\nReleased: January 24, 2017",
