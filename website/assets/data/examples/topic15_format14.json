There has been a broad trend over the past few years though has been towards a simplistic approach to glass specification and procurement. There are a few projects where more sophisticated latest glass products have been sought but more commonly glass is treated as a commodity. However there is also a significant population of projects that aim to achieve glass that achieves a high performance, looks good and has an attractive visual quality.\n\nOver the same time available glass products have multiplied and sourcing has become globalised from numerous sources in numerous geographies.

        "text":"Who is Mauricio Facchinetti?\n\nI have been involved in the GRP industry for more than 15 years, working in the machine manufacturing and product design installation.\n\nSince I was born I have been involved in the big infrastructure projects, while accompanying my father who was a civil engineer, and already as a child, I learned to enjoy a successfully completed project that worked as it was supposed to.\n\nThis life led me into becoming a civil engineer myself.\n\nDuring my successful completions of multiple bridges, underground tunnels for trains, and highway projects in countries like Italy, Brazil and Argentina, I encountered and achieved critical deadlines that had to be met, no matter the circumstances, despite any weather conditions, and unforeseen situations.\n\nWhile working on one of these projects, I came across the GRP pipes for the first time and saw great potential in them.\n\nI strongly believe the water is the most precious treasure we have.\n\nWe need to care for it, use the best way to transport it and at the same time, save as much energy as possible. All of this can be achieved with the GRP lines and pipes, because they don\u2019t corrode, they are light, extremely high in strength and perform excellently when transporting fluids, meaning they are energy efficient.\n\nWater transportation with the use of GRP pipes \u00a0\n\nAt the beginning of my GRP career, I was in charge of the design and installation of Continuous Filament Winding (CFW) lines, working for a specialised company called VEM SPA. During that time, I successfully installed more than 35 plants around the world.\n\nBut before I tell you about the second part of my GRP career, let\u2019s first talk about the 2009 GRP crisis.\n\nUp until 2008, all the GRP companies were doing amazingly well and had their filament winding machines working on full capacity. Then, the crisis of 2009 hit. Various problems started to pop up, the number of commissions for the new infrastructure projects decreased, and the GRP market lost a lot of opportunities.\n\nThe equation \u2013 produce faster to reduce the costs, was not working anymore. As a result, a lot of GRP companies struggled and even closed down.\n\nUsing my experience in the infrastructure projects, especially the knowledge from the GRP manufacturing lines, I decided to fight the problem and find a solution for it.\n\nI created, together with my partner Fabio Fracasso, the Effective Filament Winding\u00ae (EFW) method, the first ever industrial approach which allows for profit optimization in the filament winding industry.\n\n\nFabio Fraccaso and Mauricio Facchinetti photo\n\n\nIn order to reach and realize this method, I founded TOPFIBRA and created a new concept of the filament winding lines to efficiently implement the EFW method, ensuring a profit making turnkey plant.\n\nAt first, it was difficult to get this project started. The main reasons for that were the filament winding market beliefs, since many experts of the sector continuously say that the good times are going to return. And that there is no needed to change the industrial approach of the GRP manufacturing.\n\nFortunately, today, after we have been implementing the EFW method combined with the upgrades in different existing plants and installed new turnkey plants, our hard work and our determination to help the GRP market have been fully repaid by our customers\u2019 satisfaction.\n\nWould you would like to know more about the Effective Filament Winding\u00ae method?\n\nThis is the first ever industrial approach to optimise your profit in the filament winding industry. If you want to upgrade your existing GRP production plant or install a new, complete and effective CFW production line, contact me by clicking on the button below.\n\nAre you ready to optimise your profit in the Filament Winding industry?\n\n\nMauricio Facchinetti\n\nI graduated as a Civil Engineer at the University of Buenos Aires and soon afterward I entered the word of major construction projects. Years later I decided to dedicate all my energy to the unique world of glass fibre reinforced pipes (GRP).\n\nContact Information:",
