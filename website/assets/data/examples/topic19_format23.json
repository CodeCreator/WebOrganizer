        "text":"Artificial Intelligence: 101 Things You Must Know Today About Our Future by Lasse Rouhiainen - Book Review\n\n\nArtificial intelligence is software with a mechanism to learn or a computer program. It then uses the information as humans do to decide in a given context. The developers creating this program try to write code that can interpret and learn it from images, data, audio files, or video. That information can be put to use elsewhere once a computer has been conditioned. Because of the emergence of artificial intelligence systems, most of these improvements will happen.\n\nThe rapid development of other innovations, such as genetic engineering, quantum computing, biotechnology, the Internet - Of - things, virtual reality, and 3D, will influence our lives and society in countless other ways.\u00a0\n\nArtificial intelligence plays an important role nowadays, and whether you like it or not, it will dramatically change the way we do things. It can make us work better, quicker, and cheaper. Industries like hospitality, healthcare, tourism, transportation, education, agriculture, retail, finance, agriculture, marketing, and sales will be fundamentally changed. Researchers also claimed that robots and automation might replace many jobs. Examples of these are self-driving cars, chatbots, and robots.\u00a0\n\n\nThis book about Artificial Intelligence by Lasse Rouhiainen, in general, is acceptable. I discovered new fields of Artificial Intelligence that are an essential part of our daily lives and application, the importance of data, and the ability to analyze it.\u00a0\n\nMany companies use platforms like Chatbot Customer Support, Siri, Google Assistant, Online Marketing, and more. Hence, no wonder many businesses took advantage of the technology, and more and more are focusing on the advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Rouhiainen discussed how AI is currently being used by major businesses such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and how they plan to use it in the future.\n\nIn the financial sector, the author shared three facts about how AI can increase a company's profit.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 First, AI can be used for better customer service. Nowadays, especially this time of the pandemic where we are limited to go out, I've personally experienced Customer Service via Facebook Chat from our Internet Service Provider. I was just surprised; I was able to chat with an agent trying to resolve my issue online. Well, I have to admit, it is much accessible since many are using Facebook as a means of communication, sales, and marketing.\n  \u2022 Second, more efficient investment services with 'smart advisors' can provide clients with financial advice.\n  \u2022 Lastly, Chatbots, maybe soon become the primary method for customer interactions. Not only will it reduce the cost for the workforce, but few people also need to be hired for the customer service position.\n\nIf you read the book, there are lots of concepts and resources that are given for you to understand how AI works. You may also learn a solid foundation that addresses almost every introduction to AI issues. This book is simple and has an 'easy to read' description of AI and its results. Anyone can understand and be encouraged to learn more on their own.\n\nRouhiainen is an apparent supporter of AI, but the possible problems that AI can cause are not overlooked. Mostly, however, Rouhianen promotes education and dedication on the part of individuals, enterprises, and governments to create a reliable and equal basis for AI implementation. He clarifies that it is difficult to avoid the development and use of AI in this fast-changing world.\n\nBuy Now!\n\nPost a Comment",

It's a wonderful example of team narration, a real plus with this rapidly changing short essay format. There's a risk of tedious topic repetition in that much of the material deals with the same major scientific players of all time: Einstein, Newton, Galileo, Feynman, et al. This shortcoming is considerably relieved by the balanced gender mix. However, sometimes the transitions could be a bit more pronounced. Listen in batches; much of the material is so similar and the concise format so high speed that the combination can make it difficult to digest all the beauty and elegance.

My only complaint is some of the multiple choice questions were easy to interpret multiple ways, so that it was difficult to know which perspective we were expected to answer from. Sometimes, knowing too much, such as an exception to a rule, caused me to get an answer wrong when after a lot of research to make sure I found out that my answer is technically correct.\n\n\u521b\u5efa\u8005 Alireza\n\nApr 17, 2016\n\nThe course was fantastic!\n\nI just like to see more details for each of human senses.\n\nFor example for the vision, speaking, hearing, listening, emotions.\n\nI know some problem are kinda solved and people got Nobel prize for that. It could be more interesting if you could tell us which problems are not solved yet and if become solved there would be a Nobel for that.\n\nIn general, I love the course and the teacher! Thanks",

This is a quite short book, topping at 54 pages of actual content. And as a short book it doesn\u2019t give you a full perspective of Circos capabilities, but it\u2019s a start.\n\nThe author is not related to the biological field, so he takes some time explaining part of the biological terminology used in Circos, somtehing that could have been skipped to people in the area. But this does not detract from the usefulness of this book. The chapters cover most part of Circos features, mostly using examples away from biology, which is somewhat useful, as it explains how to create your own diagrams and \u201cchromosomes\u201d. At the same time, maybe if the author had included a couple more chapters about some fine details of Circos, that would have been helpful in the long run.\n\nThe book is pleasantly written, there\u2019s no fluff and the test is direct. But in the end you keep asking for more details and information, due to the abreviated size of it. As I said, it\u2019s a good start, covering with somewhat more detail what you find in Circos website, but I definitely wanted a bit more.",

Are the ice caps melting? Will polar bears and penguins soon be found starving on small floating icebergs? Does the future survival of man hinge on an immediate reduction in carbon emissions? This bold new documentary is an exciting and important tool for all who face the rampant misinformation propagated by ecological alarmists. Global Warming addresses subjects that others won\u2019t touch, including the misinformation contained in Al Gore\u2019s \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d. Through on-location interviews with leading Christian scientists, climatologists, and others, the danger and politics of global warming are revealed. Learn how you can be effective in caring for creation without becoming an unwitting accomplice to the myths of global warming. This balanced approach to a very \u201chot\u201d subject will equip you with the information necessary to honor the Creator without worshiping the creation.\n\nDove Review\n\nGlobal Warming is in a lot of discussions these days. This documentary takes a look at what may be truth or what is fiction in our world when it comes to this issue.

        "text":"Review: Dinosaurs\n\n\nThere is no shortage of dinosaur books for children, and this is reflected by Tom Holtz\u2019s admonition on the inside flap that \u201cthe world doesn\u2019t need another A-to-Z list of dinosaurs.\u201d Typically, dinosaur books are organized by name, vague groupings of creatures, or by time period, rather than any evolutionary or biological theme. Many of these volumes have passable to excellent art, but are light on scientific content, and more informative books are generally inappropriate for children. What, then, does this new book offer over other popular dinosaur books?\n\nThe major strength of Dinosaurs is that Holtz has done an excellent job explaining dinosaur science as a process; that is, how paleontologists understand the biology of dinosaurs through inferences from the fossil record. There are four basic sections of the book: basic principles of dinosaur science; the relationships and major groups of dinosaurs; the evolution of Mesozoic faunas through time; and dinosaur paleobiology; and each is infused with explanations of how science is done. Complex topics are clearly explained in a way that both children and adults will understand. Particularly impressive is that Holtz spends an entire chapter explaining the principles of cladistics, the method by which scientists reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of organisms. Although cladistics is fundamental to modern organismal biology, few popular books (and perhaps no children\u2019s books) tackle the subject in any detail, and Holtz should be applauded for taking the plunge. This explanation is also practical for the reader, because Holtz often refers to cladistics in other sections of the book when explaining the relationships of dinosaurs and how scientists make conclusions about dinosaur paleobiology.\n\nAnother advantage of this book over others is the inclusion of sidebars written by a variety of dinosaur experts. These short articles cover topics that are not directly discussed in the main text, including dinosaur growth, diseases, and feeding. Not only do these sidebars broaden the topics discussed in the book, but also they introduce a diversity of opinions and information that wouldn\u2019t be possible with a single author. The quality of these contributions varies (some are more informative than others), but they are superb overall and put the book on a level above most other children\u2019s dinosaur books.\n\nDinosaurs may not be the first book that I\u2019d reach for to teach children about evolution, but it does an excellent job integrating the principles of evolution and natural selection into the discussion of dinosaur topics. Evolution is used to explain how we know the relationships of dinosaurs, provide hypotheses about dinosaur behavior, and explain why different growth strategies might be beneficial. Holtz\u2019s introductory chapter on evolution is short, but it effectively communicates the basic principles of natural selection and concepts like the evolutionary tree of life.\n\nThis is one of the best popular dinosaur books I\u2019ve read. Although focused for children, it will also be informative for students and adults. The book is packed with up-to-date and clearly explained information, and the author maintains a website for future updates ( Given the information content, clear explanations, full-color semi-glossy printing, and hardback binding, this book is an excellent value at the list price of $34.99.\n\nAbout the Author(s):\u00a0\nRandall B Irmis\nMuseum of Paleontology\n1101 Valley Life Sciences Building\nUniversity of California\nBerkeley CA 94720-4780\n\nRandall B Irmis is a PhD candidate in the Department of Integrative Biology and Museum of Paleontology, University of California, Berkeley.\n\nDinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages\nRandall B Irmis\nThis version might differ slightly from the print publication.\nThomas R Holtz Jr\nillustrated by Luis V Rey\nNew York: Random House, 2007. 428 pages",

Provided are excellent discussions of the physiological setting, geology, climate, floral breakdown, historical botanical exploration, instructions for use and a glossary. The key itself is of line key form and the excellent illustrations are taken from the Flora of the Pacific Northwest. Though it is a bit large for easy use in the field this comprehensive work is an essential component of anyone\u2019s library who is interested in the regions flora.\n\nThis book is a product of the USDA Forest Service research system and is not very easy to find. Currently it is unavailable on amazon.com and other commercial outlets. Contacting the local Forest Service or BLM offices in western Montana or the bookstore at the University of Montana is probably the best way to currently find this locally popular book.\n\nFrom the back flap:\n\nThis comprehensive guidebook provides keys, illustrations, and descriptions that aid identification of the 1,600+ species and varieties of vascular plants growing in west-central Montana. The area covered encompasses Ravalli County and southern Missoula County, and it includes the Bitterroot National Forest and portions of the Lolo National Forest. This guidebook uses a minimum of technical terminology and is intended for use by the public as well as by scientists, foresters, and educators. It may also serve as a model for compilation of similar information in other regions.\n\n\nPublisher: USDA Forest Service. Intermountain Res. Station, Odgen, UT. 1991\nASIN: B000H6X1M6\nGen. Tech.

        "text":"\u201eThe wolves return\u201c by Celia\u00a0Godkin\n\nWhen the first settlers set foot on American soil, they encountered wolves everywhere. But due to hunting and habitat changes there were hardly any wolves left by the middle of the 20th century\u2026 1978, the wolves were listed as a threatened species in forty-eight states. In 1995 thirteen wolves from Canada were released on the Yellowstone National Park. The following year another ten wolves followed. The experiment was a success with now over hundred wolves living in Yellowstone. But, even more important: The wolves play an important role for the health of other species and the balance of the ecosystem.\n\n\"The wolves return\" by Celia Godkin, Pajama Press\n\n\u201cThe wolves return\u201d by Celia Godkin, biologist and associate professor at the University of Toronto as well as award-winning author and illustrator, explains the journey of reintroducing wild wolves to Yellowstone and the consecutive changes in the environments of the park in kid-friendly words.\n\nWolves had been extinct in Yellowstone for a long time and the return of the big carnivores has a huge effect on the local wildlife, which in return changes the environment and local wildlife: As\u00a0wolves primarily prey on weak elks, they keep the herds smaller, but healthier. The elks move from the bottom of the valley to the higher areas with more trees for shelter, which gives the seedlings which were previously eaten by elks the chance to grow. Within years, the valley changes to a wooden area with tall trees. Beavers use this trees to build dams and beaver houses to raise families. Beaver ponds are a home for waterfowl and fish, which in return attract ospreys and otter. Berry bushes are growing back and provide food and shelter for birds, insects and bears. Fewer elk also let bison herds increase in size. But wolves not only control the number of elks. As huge predators, the coyotes leave Yellowstone. They prey now becomes food for hawks, weasels, badgers and foxes\u2026 After almost 20 years the return of a few wolves changed the face of Yellowstone National Park forever. Would you have guessed that a single species can have such a high impact?\n\"The wolves return\" by Celia Godkin, Pajama Press\n\n\nEcology is a complex topic, but\u00a0Celia Godkin does a great job with explaining biological correlations\u00a0to children from preschool to middle school age. Her texts\u00a0are easy to understand, without complicated technical terms or terminology. What wakes the love for nature are her artwork: True-to-life pencil and watercolor illustrations capture the attention of children and adults from the first page on. It\u2019s hard for an expert to explain scientific topics in easy words and almost impossible to find the right words suitable and plausible for children. Celia Godkin does an expert job! The appendix of the book gives a short overview of the history of wolves in the US and is a great add on for older children, teacher and parents.\n\nOur daughter loved \u201cThe wolves return\u201d. She is interested in nature in general and loves wolves \u2013 she wants to convince me that our local coyotes are \u201cjust baby wolves\u201d each time we spot one\u2026 It was really enjoyable to teach her about one of her favorite animals and the development of an ecosystem within a short time span. I studied biology at university and am acquainted with the basics of ecology, although it never was my specialty. I didn\u2019t even know of the return of the wolves to Yellowstone and had a great time researching the topic. We will follow on this topic tomorrow as I found some interesting videos and materials online\u2026 I can just guess what a great resource this book is for homeschooling parents or teachers! The publisher also provides a teaching guide, which was unfortunately not online yet at time of this review.\n\n\"The wolves return\" by Celia Godkin, Pajama Press\n\nLong story short: \u201cThe wolves return\u201d is a great non-fiction book with an environmental message for children every age. It\u2019s a great way to raise children who love nature and are sensible to the ecological problems. \u201cThe wolves return\u201d is another wonderful children\u2019s book by Pajama Press, an independent publisher from Canada.\n\nMore information:\n\n\u201cThe wolves return\u201d\nby Celia Godkin\nHardcover: 32 pages\nPublisher: Pajama Press\nISBN-13: 978-1772780116",

        "text":"You are here\n\nNumber Theory: A Lively Introduction with Proofs, Applications, and Stories\n\nJames E. Pommersheim, Tim K. Marks, and Erica L. Flapan\nJohn Wiley\nPublication Date:\u00a0\nNumber of Pages:\u00a0\n[Reviewed by\nMikl\u00f3s B\u00f3na\n, on\n\nThis is a very accessible and well-written book whose best use is as a textbook for a course designed for non-majors or for students who are preparing to be mathematics teachers in high school. While the material that is covered is serious and the coverage itself is rigorous, the topics are not quite advanced enough nor diverse enough for the usual\u00a0course taken by mathematics majors. No calculus background is required, so even a talented and dedicated high-school student can attempt to read the book.\n\nEach chapter starts by explaining the historical context of the results to be shown, and by the introduction of an important historical figure. There is often a funny fictional conversation between two people from very different centuries. This puts the reader in the mood for the upcoming topics.\n\nThe introductory part is long. The fact that there are infinitely many primes, which is the first theorem in many number theory classes, is proved on page 105. This is because the first two chapters teach the non-mathematics student how to prove statements, by induction or by other means.\n\nChapters 3\u20139 are still quite basic, and are mostly about divisibility issues and modular arithmetic. Many mathematics majors see this material in a Transition to Advanced Mathematics course, so the first half of the book would not be new for them.\n\nChapter 10\u201315 are on more advanced topics, such as primality testing, quadratic residues, and Gaussian integers. These chapters are independent, so the instructor is free to choose any subset of them. Multiplicative algebraic number theory is the dominant overarching theme.\n\nThere are plenty of exercises, and the book is a pleasure to read. If you have the right audience for it, you will enjoy teaching from this book as well.\n\nMikl\u00f3s B\u00f3na is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Florida.\n\n\nTo the Student.\n\nTo the Instructor.\n\n\n0.

We will start by introducing the complex plane, along with the algebra and geometry of complex numbers, and then we will make our way via differentiation, integration, complex dynamics, power series representation and Laurent series into territories at the edge of what is known today. Each module consists of five video lectures with embedded quizzes, followed by an electronically graded homework assignment. Additionally, modules 1, 3, and 5 also contain a peer assessment. The homework assignments will require time to think through and practice the concepts discussed in the lectures. In fact, a significant amount of your learning will happen while completing the homework assignments. These assignments are not meant to be completed quickly; rather you'll need paper and pen with you to work through the questions. In total, we expect that the course will take 6-12 hours of work per module, depending on your background....\n\n\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0438\n\n\nApr 06, 2018\n\nThe lectures were very easy to follow and the exercises fitted these lectures well.

It uses Mathematica (there\u2019s a Maple version available). The book picks three areas of (lower division college) math to work with \u2013 Elementary number theory (including tastes of the Fibonacci sequence, perfect numbers and amicable pairs, continued fractions, and the sieve of Eratosthenes), Calculus (with tastes of limits, differentiation, integration, differential equations, and surfaces and volumes of rotation), and linear algebra \u2013 and uses a tutorial style to demonstrate how to use a CAS to perform experiments, to compute things in multiple ways to enhance your understanding of the relationships between different mathematical ideas, and to discover edge cases where theorems \u2013 or your intuitions \u2013 might not work.\n\nAlong the way it teaches the minimum you need to know about Mathematica to make progress. The goal isn\u2019t to teach Mathematica as a programming language but as an adjunct to mathematical study. What is covered includes basic syntax, defining functions, conditionals and loops, and some Mathematica-specific features (not common in mainstream programming languages) like pattern matching. Different kinds of basic plotting functions are also described and used. At all times the reader is encouraged to look for more information in the Mathematica documentation \u2013 and given search terms to help with that.\n\nThe section on elementary number theory is where the Mathematica syntax and semantics is introduced, including loops, functions, and numerical versus symbolic evaluation. The calculus section emphasizes the Mathematica plotting functions. Finally, the linear algebra section adds matrices and more on symbolic evaluation (and could really have used some plotting examples: plotting (or better, animation) would have been very effective to show what eigenvalues and eigenvectors are and how they really work).\n\nEach section ends with a number of (simple) exercises to help ensure that you\u2019ve learned both the math and the Mathematica covered in the section. And, each section also has a set of \u201cFurther Explorations\u201d which are related mathematical questions that are intended to be used as a launching point to learn something using the techniques explained in the book (though the further explorations in the linear algebra section are rather slim).\n\nThere\u2019s a final section on \u201cvisualization\u201d and geometry: A few more Mathematica features related to plotting, and a suggestion that you can use other software tools \u2013 besides a CAS \u2013 for the same purposes: to visualize mathematics and gain understanding. They use the dynamic geometry program Cinderella as the example software here, providing two simple and short investigations in plane geometry. (I appreciated this as Cinderella happens to be my dynamic geometry program of choice \u2013 having excellent built-in support for non-Euclidean geometry, also affine and projective geometry, also simple physics simulations, and is fully programmable besides.)\n\nThis book really meets its objective of showing the reader how to explore mathematics using a computer algebra system, while at the same time giving a brief introduction to a specific CAS, Mathematica. It is well written. I highly recommend it as an introduction to this great modern way of learning mathematics. To further your practice in both Mathematica itself and in using Mathematica to explore mathematics, I also highly recommend Mathematica in Action, 3rd edition, by Stan Wagon. It has much more mathematics, and much more Mathematica.\n\n(I do have to point out that the book has a lot of typos. In fact, I should stop here. The typos (largely in Mathematica code) are easily fixed by the reader and don\u2019t detract from the contents of the book. That\u2019s why I give this book 5 stars even though it has typos. So you can stop reading here unless you\u2019d like to help me work off my pique.\n\nWhen I say this book has typos: I mean, it has plenty of typos. I marked 50 in the first 100 pages then gave up. Most are trivial errors in Mathematica code, e.g., missing commas or misplaced braces, that are easily seen by the reader or discovered as soon as you type the code into Mathematica, and in these cases the fixes are obvious so there\u2019s no problem. In some places the typo isn\u2019t so obvious but you can tell from context what\u2019s wrong. Elsewhere there are copy-and-paste errors where two Mathematica examples, supposedly different ways to do something, are in fact identical. Two of the plots, if you actually execute their code, produce slightly different results from the (correct, intended) picture in the book. Several times an equation being discussed has different variables in the text (e.g., \u201ca\u201d) than in the code sample (e.g., \u201cx\u201d), or even in two consecutive sentences in the text! In a couple of places in the text , the variable is in one place in a sentence the Greek letter \u03b8 and in another place in the same sentence the word \u201ctheta\u201d.\n\nIn one remarkable type (page 101) the discussion in the book, having previously encouraged the use of the online Inverse Symbolic Calculator, wants to make the point that you shouldn\u2019t rely on the results from the ISC: you use them as a suggestion, and validate them some other way. This is a good point, but the example it gives is totally bollixed up. The authors show a calculation of a particular integral giving a specific 10-digit numerical value. Then they look it up using the ISC and get a suggestion for a formula for this value that matches to 10 digits. Then they say that if you actually calculated the integral beyond 10 digits it becomes obvious that the value of the integral is not the value of the formula. The problem is: The numerical value they give for the integral has its last two digits transposed. And THAT transposed value is the one they looked up in the ISC (which I determined by plugging the formula into Mathematica and getting its numeric value to 10 digits). So no wonder it didn\u2019t match! The point of the paragraph is still valid; the example was broken, because of a bad copy of the value from Mathematica into the text!\n\nWhy am I harping on these typos so much when I say they don\u2019t really affect the content of the book, which his still excellent? Pique! It is hard to write a book, I know. So hard, that even though I\u2019d like to sometime write a technical book of my own I haven\u2019t done it yet and doubt I ever will. I have a lot of respect for book authors for writing books. One of the authors of this book, Borwein, has written 10 books (and hundreds of papers). What is so difficult for me to do is apparently so easy for him that he can just write \u2018em and publish \u2018em and get on to the next thing, without even worrying about the details. Couldn\u2019t he have found an undergraduate who would have proofread the book, typing the expressions into Mathematica, for $100, or even just brownie points? Where\u2019s the pride? See: it is just my pique getting scratched in these last 4 paragraphs. Don\u2019t let it stop you from learning from this very good book.)",

        "text":"GREAT PROJECTS by James Tobin\n\n\nThe Epic Story of the Building of America, From the Taming of the Mississippi to the Invention of the Internet\nEmail this review\n\n\nEight great American engineering achievements will be the subject of a major PBS series in 2002. Traditionally, publishers commission a densely illustrated coffee-table book to accompany such a show: here, happily, is a superior example of the genre.\n\nWhile apparently chosen at random, all eight are impressive achievements. The earliest\u2014but still in progress\u2014is the taming of the lower Mississippi. Beginning with levees now stretching a thousand miles, work continues with massive dams, spillways, floodways, and control structures to keep the river from changing course. Experts agree this is ultimately futile, but the economic consequences would be so awful if we stopped that the projects continue. Historian Tobin (Ernie Pyle's War, 1997) illustrates the preoccupation of engineers with water by including three additional achievements: Hoover Dam, the New York City bridges, and the New York City water system. Electrical engineering takes up three chapters: the first is largely devoted to Thomas Edison, the man who not only invented the first practical electric light, but built the first electrical generating system (in New York). It lost money. The second describes development of the immense, worldwide electrical grid we take for granted. Last, the author tells the story of the Internet, an extension of this electrical grid, this time connecting individuals. Great engineering feats can turn out badly. Some would place our urban freeway system in this category. The author makes a good case by devoting a chapter to the most expensive engineering project in US history: the \u201cbig dig\u201d now building a freeway through downtown Boston\u2014underground. When it's finished, the detested surface freeway directly overhead will be torn down. Meanwhile, Tobin provides generous historical background to each project and doesn't neglect to explain scientific and engineering problems in a way laymen can understand. Maps, diagrams, and rare photographs appear on almost every page.\n\nA fine addition to the sparse library of engineering histories.\n\nPub Date:\u00a0Oct. 11th, 2001\nISBN:\u00a00-7432-1064-6\nPage count:\u00a0352pp\nPublisher:\u00a0Free Press\nReview Posted Online:\nKirkus Reviews Issue: July\u00a015th,\u00a02001\n\n\nNonfictionTHE MAN HE BECAME by James Tobin\nby James Tobin\nNonfictionTO CONQUER THE AIR by James Tobin\nby James Tobin\nNonfictionERNIE PYLE'S WAR by James Tobin\nby James Tobin",

He then showed us a video. The video was a documentary of Bengal tigers that was shown on Discovery Channel. The documentary featured Mr. Marr on one of his trips in Asia to save the tigers.\n  \u2022 After the video Mr. Marr started a slideshow. He told us about what he did in Asia and what was happening to the tigers and their habitat. He showed us pictures of some of the tigers he saw that are now extinct.\n  \u2022 In his slide show Mr. Marr also showed us what he was doing to help the Asian community. He told us that he would give the village people alternatives to cutting down the forests that would not make them dependent on him. Sadly the slideshow took up the rest of the period so there was no time for questions.\n\n\nAnthony Marr was one of the most interesting and informed speakers we have had. His presentation was very well organized and flowed very well. I especially liked how everything was tied together. He also seemed to be one of the most active of the speakers that we have had. He already had toured the country and gone to Asia several times.\n\nI really liked how Mr. Marr was helping the villagers in Asia. He would provide the village people solutions to their problems, but he would not fix the problems himself. This made the villagers do the work themselves and not become dependent on outside sources. Mr. Marr is not only out to save tigers. He wants to save their habitat, stop poachers, and to inform everyone he can about what is happening in our world.\n\nGo on to Student - 06\nReturn to Educational Outreach: Secondary (High) Schools and Universities\n\nHome Page\n\n\nWhat's New\n\nPreserving Earth's Biodiversity\n\n\n\n\nTerminate the Canadian Seal Massacre\n\nCompassion for Animals Road Expeditions (CARE)\n\nDeep-Rural-India Expeditions\n\nEducational Outreach\n\nUndercover Operations\n\nMedia Events\n\nInternational Conferences\n\nOmniscientific Cosmology and Integrative Transcendence\n\nAbout Anthony Marr\n\n\n\nContact Us and Donate\n\nYour Comments and Inquiries are Welcome\n\n\nThis site is hosted and maintained by\nThe Mary T. and Frank L.

        "text":"You are here\n\nCogwheels of the Mind: The Story of Venn Diagrams\n\nA. W. F. Edwards\nHopkins University Press\nPublication Date:\u00a0\nNumber of Pages:\u00a0\n[Reviewed by\nDarren Glass\n, on\n\nLast summer during Mathfest I found myself one day at a Boulder coffeeshop working on my research. This particular day, working on my research consisted of drawing Venn diagrams and putting dots in the various sections (representing the overlapping branch loci of various hyperelliptic curves if you must know, but that's not important to this review). Page after page was filled with three overlapping circles and dots. At one point, while refilling my coffee, I walked by a man who also had in front of him page after page of drawings of three overlapping circles with various dots in them. Intrigued, I asked him about his doodling, and it turned out he was a complex analyst also working on his research. There we were, two mathematicians working in very different fields, both of whom were using Venn diagrams as an integral part of their research.\n\nI would wager that \u2014 whether explicitly or implicitly \u2014 we all use Venn diagrams in our thinking. They give a pictorial illustration and concreteness to the set theory and logical constructions which we all use constantly, whether we realize it or not. From my own experience, I know that ever since I was first introduced to the idea as a child I have used Venn diagrams to figure out or record any number of things, and I doubt that I am in the minority. Yet I never had any idea where they came from, or even who Venn was. Therefore, in this age where books \u2014 and bestselling books at that \u2014 are written about the history of everything from the number zero to salt to the color mauve, it is not surprising that someone would write a book about the history of the Venn diagram.\n\nA. W. F. Edwards has done just that with Cogwheels of the Mind. It is a short book, clocking in at just over 100 pages including a copious number of illustrations, which is a quick, enjoyable, and informative read. It is the kind of book that I can imagine giving to a wide range of readers: any junior high student would be able to follow the mathematics, and most professors would find it interesting. Edwards is a fellow of Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge, and he was originally attracted to learning about Venn after working on a stained glass window at the college dedicated to Venn and to the biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher, both of whom were presidents of the college.\n\nThe first few chapters of the book discuss the history of Venn diagrams. In particular, while Euler had developed diagrams which appear similar much earlier, Venn found these to be too restrictive to deal with the logical propositions he wished to consider. So he created a new way of graphically representing what amounts to a Boolean algebra. As Edwards writes, \"the novelty of [Venn's] diagram lies in its ability to represent propositions and not merely sets.\" This is why, in a July 1880 article in The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, Venn introduced to the world the diagrams that now carry his name. Personally, I would have liked more detail in the historical portions of the book, and the mathematical context of the time which Venn was working in. But Edwards chooses not to linger and to move on to the more mathematical content.\n\nThe later chapters of the book are essays and ruminations on different properties of Venn diagrams. The text is written in the first person, and walk the reader through the author's thought processes as he considers the intimate connection between Venn diagrams and Boolean algebra, and the implications this has on using Venn diagrams to work with Grey codes, binomial coefficients, hypercubes, and numerous other topics. A large amount of space is dedicated to the problem of constructing general Venn diagrams \u2014 we all know how to draw two or three set Venn diagrams in our sleep, and while you cannot do it with circles it is nonetheless not to difficult to use ovals to create four set Venn diagrams. But the question of creating Venn diagrams with arbitrary numbers of sets was not settled until a 1988 paper by Edwards himself, despite the fact that many others, including Lewis Carroll, had written about most of the important ideas that Edwards uses.\n\nThere are two somewhat more technical appendices. The first deals with a topic, Metric Venn Diagrams, which ties Venn's work in with Fisher's work in genetics. Typically one does not attempt to draw Venn diagrams so that the size of the regions conveys anything about the frequency of the events (that is, we draw the circle representing \"redheads\" to be the same size as that representing \"right handed\", despite the fact that the latter is far more frequent). However, it is often desirable to attempt to break this convention, and Edwards discusses some results in this direction.\n\nThe book is full of nice illustrations, ranging from flags and stained glass windows, to many drawings illustrating the key ideas. It even includes a copy of a Venn diagram drawn by Winston Churchill depicting the three sets of Europe, the British Empire, and the English-speaking world, with the United Kingdom the only thing in the intersection of all three. The interior of the book looks very nice, despite a cover that one would do best not to judge the book by. Cogwheels of the Mind is a slow meandering walk through many different ideas related to Venn diagrams, and as such I imagine it would frustrate some readers. However, I found it to be a nice \u2014 if light \u2014 read, and it is well worth a look.\n\nDarren Glass is an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Columbia University.

        "text":"Goodbye Fossil Fuels. Hello Algae!\n\nMonday February 9th, 2009 at 7:22 AM\nPosted by: m35man\n\nAlgae is not a loud noise in the challenge to find alternative fuels. But it will be. Algae biofuel offers us a great deal of hope in our battle against fossil fuels.\n\nHybrid electric automobiles typically steal most of the spotlight when it comes to the idea of \u2018green\u2019 vehicles, which reduce their environmental impact by consuming small amounts of gasoline or limiting the emissions produced by their operation. Gasoline \/ electric hybrids certainly lead this charge, but bringing up the rear are an entire host of alternative fuels which promise to provide a similar driving experience with either ultra-clean emissions or no emissions at all. The contenders include ethanol produced from corn or other vegetable matter, biodiesel which also originates from plants, or even propane and natural gas.\n\nOne type of fuel which rarely sees mention also happens to be one which appears to offer a great deal of promise for the future. Algae, a type of plant life that is found in abundance in oceans all over the world, can actually produce a significant amount of natural oil that can be used as a fuel source. Marine algae is not familiar to most North American drivers, but in Asian countries where the population has a closer relationship to the sea algae and other types of ocean agriculture are nothing new. Recent investments in the development of algae-based fuels have been brought on by the increase in fossil fuel prices, and some of the results have been staggering.\n\nIt turns out that not only is marine algae a viable fuel source, but it also packs a much more concentrated punch than other biofuels. In fact, it is estimated that compared to the most potent fuel crops grown on land, algae can squeeze 30 times more energy out of a single acre. Advances in marine agriculture have created algae farms where special growing tubes can help produce 100,000 gallons of oil out of a single acre.\n\nThese impressive numbers have drawn a lot of attention in the alternative fuel community, and for good reason. Aquatic agriculture does not use huge amounts of landmass like corn growing does, allowing that area to be put to better use growing foodstuffs or sustaining livestock. Algae is also fairly inexpensive to cultivate, requiring only water, sunlight and the right conditions to propagate quickly. It can also use water that has been deemed too polluted for standard agriculture without affecting its yield \u2013 even raw sewage. This helps to ensure that algae growth will not absorb resources which could be better used in other areas of the economy.\n\nThe price of breaking free from the traditional fossil fuel chains that encircle the world\u2019s economy is innovation, and looking towards algae-base initiatives seems to point towards an answer that is not only effective, but also non-destructive to the environment. The rapid growth of algae helps to ensure that establishing an infrastructure of oil-producing plants would take a very reasonable amount of time, and its hardiness means that even cities, historically not associated with agriculture would be able to house algae production facilities. Mankind emerged from the ocean millions of years ago, and it seems as though the circle of evolution has been closed once again as we now look back to the sea for the answer to our future.\n\nPages: 1 2\n\nLatest Reviews\n\nSelect a Category",

It seemed to be only about 500 yards away, but from the size of the object, you were able to tell it was many miles away. It seemed to be hovering at a stillness I can't even describe. The details were more vivid of any photos I have yet to ever seen, I and others were even able to see windows on the air craft. It had many golden lights around it. If I were to try to look close enough, it was so detailed, if I gave an attempt maybe I could even see the objects inside the space craft.\n\nNights prior to the evening my family had gotten weird phone calls (ones of which it would call the house with only a voicemail, and unusual sounds would be signaled on the other line), we called the Verizon network, they said what we were describing of the calls to be unnatural and unheard of. That same night, I had a dream of being abducted, but that seems to be out of subject.\n\nNo photos have been taken, unfortunately. It was a fast 2-3 minute sighting, and there was six witnesses.

I and many people of the town or maybe the state saw it that night, but I guess I am the only one to report it so far.\n\nThe object was in great detail, much of golden lights, windows, and even a disk like shape. This is not a lie; it is a reporting that should be known to all UFO investigators.\n\nNote: When the object disappeared it seemed to disappear in a flash, but you heard the sound it made, very unusual sound, and it hurt the ear.

        "text":"The Truth about Oil and the Looming World Energy Crisis. C. J. Campbell\n\nAfter hearing about Colin Campbell\u2019s most recent publication in the July \u201904 ASPO newsletter I had to order myself a copy. This is what the newsletter had to say:\n\n\u201cA booklet by C.J.Campbell with the above title is now on sale from . It provides an outline of the subject in plain non-technical language, using the medium of an imaginary Public Inquiry to make the point. It includes a copy of the proposed Depletion Protocol that would better manage depletion, and a CD containing ten Power Point presentations complete with speaker notes. The booklet is aimed at the widest possible audience providing different interest groups, especially in the educational field, with the essential ingredients for lectures, courses, talks and presentations within their own spheres. The initial response has been very positive.\u201d\n\nI obtained my copy direct from Eagle Office, they don\u2019t have the facility to take credit card payment on-line but phoning the number on the website was quick and easy, I spoke to Gemma who was very friendly. I placed the order on Monday (6th July \u201904) afternoon and it arrived from Ireland to my UK address on the Wednesday. Total cost 21.75 Euro (~\u00a314.50).\n\nThe booklet is A5 in size, spiral bound and comprises of 54 pages (46 excluding the contents, bibliography and references) and is printed in black and red.\n\nThe booklet addresses the topic of Peak Oil in a novel and refreshing way, as a commentary on an imaginary Public Inquiry. This commentary allows a vast range of opinions, facts and analysis to be covered in remarkably few words. This clear and efficient style makes it very readable and if distributed and publicised widely could reach a far wider audience than any 300 page book could.\n\nThe bibliography itself is very complete \u2013 the ultimate reading list for anyone interested in the subject.\n\nI came to this publication having already read Deffeyes K. S., Hubbert\u2019s peak \u2013 the impending world oil shortage and Heinberg R., The Party\u2019s Over not to mention the majority of ASPO newsletters so it didn\u2019t tell me very much new. The strengths of this publication are it\u2019s accessibility to a wide audience. Certainly suitable to pass to friends and family.\n\nAccompanying the book is a CD with 10 power point presentations. These are excellent. I have on a couple of occasions tried to create a neat, tidy, clear, structured presentation on this subject\u2026 without much success. Campbell has succeeded where I failed.\n\nThe final few pages contain current oil & gas production for 64 countries as well as forecasts out to 2050.\n\nI feel the price is a little steep for something that has the potential to be so widely accessible. I have no idea how much it costs to self publish material like this. I expect it\u2019s not cheap but it would be nice to see this available at Amazon for under \u00a310. Drops half a star for the price but otherwise highly recommended.\n\nAdded:\u00a0 Thursday, July 08, 2004\nReviewer: \u00a0Chris\nScore: 4 1\/2 stars\nRelated Link:",
