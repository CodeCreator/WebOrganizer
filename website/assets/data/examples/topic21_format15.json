        "text":"WVU 9th In ESPN BCS\u00a0Projections\n\nBrad Edwards of ESPN.com has published the Worldwide Leader\u2019s BCS Projections ahead of the official release next Sunday. Where is West Virginia?\n\n\nThis is very good news. It tells us a few things. The computers don\u2019t hate us. Our strength of schedule is relatively good and should only get better with the match-up with Cincinnati (and I guess Rutgers and UConn). Mississippi State has the chance to be a good game as well. Also, we are high enough that winning out 99.9% guarantees us a BCS berth, no matter if we win the Big EAST or not. This is also good news.\n\nWhere are some other teams? LSU is the obvious #1, Cal #2, USF #5, Missouri #6, Oklahoma #12, and USC way down at #13. Being ahead of media darlings Oklahoma and USC should give WVU fans a little excitement. As crazy as this season has gone, the national championship is not completely out of the realm of possibility.\n\nFrom my perspective, win out and the rest of it will take care of itself.\n\nAddThis Feed Button\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"Boston Marathon: The things I wish someone told\u00a0me\n\n\nWhen I look around at my running friends I would hardly be the person I\u2019d point to and say \u201cThere\u2019s your expert on the Boston Marathon\u201d. I am privileged to count as friends people that have run\u00a0Boston dozens of times. All of them can and will provide intricate details of the course, and are very helpful with race day strategies. You can also find countless on-line guides to actually running the race. But many Boston veterans\u00a0have forgotten what it\u2019s like to be a rookie there and the things a rookie might want or need to know. So in random order, here are some of the things I wish I knew last year going into my first Boston.\n\nIf you can afford it stay in town.\u00a0I have a lot of running friends for whom Boston is old hat, and has become just another race in their season. Travel, lodging, and meals are done for as little money as possible and the sole focus is getting from the start to the finish and getting out of town. Hey, if that\u2019s your thing I\u2019m not knocking it. But if this is a new event for you, you should really enjoy the atmosphere of Boston on race weekend. I had a positively miserable race last year running-wise but I was continuously amazed by the spirit and excitement of the city and all of it\u2019s people for the entire weekend. In other towns, \u201crace weekend\u201d is an inconvenience and hassle but in Boston everyone is excited for the Marathon. Perhaps a bit of this is still a sense of recovery from the bombings, but everywhere I went, people thanked me for coming, asked me how my race was, asked if I\u2019d be coming back. It was as if I was lifted up on a pedestal just for running from Hopkinton to Boyleston street.\n\nLeave your car home.\u00a0You won\u2019t need it. It will be expensive to park. You can get everywhere on the T or on foot. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help with the T. Once you figure it out it\u2019s pretty simple but not immediately obvious. The locals are happy we are there and will be glad to take the time to help you with tickets and point you to the right platform.\n\nGo to Mike\u2019s Pastry shopIt\u2019s in the North End. Just look for the crowd when you get there. And yes: It\u2019s that good and the line goes fast.\u00a0mikes\n\nYou can see the whole course at the expo.\u00a0I assume they do this every year, but\u00a0last year there was a theatre setup in the middle of the expo where they stream a loop of the course. It is very good. I watched it twice and felt like I was familiar with the course.\n\nThe expo is HUGE.\u00a0Get your packet. Go checkout out the big poster with all the names and find yours, maybe hit a couple specific vendors and the video (above). You can also buy your jacket there. (If I\u2019d have mail-ordered mine I would have gotten the wrong size). They have lots of other apparel too, all mostly overpriced as you can imagine. But focus on race day and don\u2019t expend all your energy at the expo. You can see all that stuff on-line or elsewhere.\u00a0hopkinton\n\nPrepare to walk a lot race morning . . before you ever get to the start.\u00a0Depending on where your hotel is, or where you park, or what T stop you get off you have to do a lot of walking. Last year our hotel had a shuttle to take us to\u00a0Boston Commons where you get on the school buses out to Hopkinton. First, they could only get so close. There are dozens of buses and they had a lot of the city streets choked. It was then necessary to walk the rest of the way to Boston Commons, several blocks more to bag drop. (Just past the finish). Then several blocks back across Boston Commons to the buses. Once there, we waited in line for a bit to get on a bus. The bus ride to Hopkinton isn\u2019t particularly short (closer to 4o minutes than the advertised 20). Once there, there is yet more walking to the athlete\u2019s village. From the athlete\u2019s village it is a few more blocks around to the start. I didn\u2019t have my Garmin on for all this but I\u2019d assume 2-3 miles of walking before hearing the word \u201cGo\u201d.\n\nThe MBTA has the most useful information for getting to and from the start and finish here.\n\nThe BAA map and directions are also helpful though missing some detail.\n\nVolunteer Map\nNot the official version but much more helpful\n\nThings to know about the Athlete\u2019s Village.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 There are 2-3 sections of the Athlete\u2019s Village. Don\u2019t necessarily stop at the first one.\n  \u2022 They have a lot of porta potties. A lot. Still, lines form \u00a0the closer to the start you get. Just give yourself enough time for that last minute pit stop.\n  \u2022 There are a whole bunch more porta potties on the way to the corrals. I didn\u2019t use these so don\u2019t know what the wait time is. But if you want to use them be ready to leave as soon as your wave is called. They are in a big lot off to the left as you get nearer the start.\n  \u2022 Aside from porta potties, the other thing they have a lot of is runners. Unless you\u2019ve arranged to meet friends somewhere specific, don\u2019t expend a lot of energy walking around trying to find people. It is nearly impossible. Find a comfy spot, spread your blanket out, sit\/lay down and chill.\n  \u2022 You can get breakfast there. They have everything. Bagels, bananas and other fruit, Clif products, coffee, water, orange juice. This is helpful since you probably won\u2019t start your race until mid-morning at a time you\u2019d ordinarily be done your long run. Again, seek out the more distant breakfast and drink areas. They will be less busy especially early.\n  \u2022 There are tents but if it were raining no way in hell would everyone be able to fit under the tents. Be prepared if the weather is iffy. Maybe a big cheap golf umbrella or poncho, or cheap plastic rain gear you can leave behind.\n  \u2022 There are roving photographers. Chances are you can get your best pre-race photo ever here. Take the time to get the photo the way you want. The photographer isn\u2019t in a hurry. If you want to take off your warm-up stuff to get your photo in racing attire, do it. They won\u2019t mind.\n  \u2022 Goodwill is your friend. We all know about throw away shirts for racing, but depending on what time you get to the Athlete\u2019s Village, you could be there a while. Go to Goodwill and buy some warm, comfortable stuff to wear while you wait, and ideally an old blanket. Don\u2019t worry. It won\u2019t go to waste. They have people everywhere on your way to the start to collect these things and re-donate them. Last year I had a really nice fleece jacket that I paid something like $1.80 for. I almost hated to get rid of it.\n\n    The athlete\u2019s village\n\nHeartbreak hill isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u00a0Hopefully you haven\u2019t hit race day never having done any hills. Don\u2019t be intimidated by the idea of this hill 20 miles in to the course. Honestly, it isn\u2019t all that bad. Just focus on good running form and be patient. But then if you haven\u2019t run any hills in training perhaps now is a\u00a0good time to panic.\n\nThe Citgo sign is a long way from the finish.\u00a0Everybody talks about the damned Citgo sign and how it means you are almost at the finish. BULLSHIT. You can see that thing\u00a0for miles. It\u2019s no different than somebody yelling \u201cYou\u2019re almost there!\u201d when you aren\u2019t.\n\nThe finish is crazy.\u00a0For a runner it\u2019s awesome. It is downright deafening. For your family or friends it\u2019s gotta be nuts. I would not have any spectators in my circle try to watch from the finish and it has nothing to do with 2013. I think they\u2019d have to get there at 5:00 in the morning to even get near where they could see. If they want to see you go by I think I\u2019d send them out near Coolidge Corner. There was still a lot of people out that way but open space right along the course to easily see and cheer. They\u2019d still have time to walk back and meet you by the time you get done, go through the finish chute, get your post-race food and clothes, etc. The hot tip here would be for them to be on the South side which is the same side as the family meeting area.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a long way to bag pick-up.\u00a0Once you cross the line your journey is not done. There is a long procession through medals, water, blanket, food, photography, and down the road to bag drop\/pick-up. I don\u2019t remember if there was any sort of changing tent. I just put on a dry shirt across from where I picked up my bag and then went off to find my wife. I think I had a towel and dry shorts in my bag but was cramping up too badly to try to change under a towel.\n\nFamily meeting areas.\u00a0Perhaps this was spelled out somewhere but if it was I missed it. The family meeting area is divided up alphabetically. If you knew this, it would be fairly easy to find your family there. Also, AT&T provides booths with plenty of cell phones to call your family or friends. (See map for locations). Of course, they have to be listening or looking for your call. Also, there were a ton of vendors giving out lots of free food samples on Stuart street of the meeting area. Most of this was better than the food in the official food bag.\u00a02015_finishmap\n\nMake sure you family is paying attention to their phone! It\u2019s noisy, and crowded. They aren\u2019t going to hear it ring. Trust me.\u00a0\u2018Nuff said.\n\nThe T is free.\u00a0Yes they DO let you and your family on to the T for free after the race. You hear this rumored but the BAA\u2019s official vague statement\u00a0is that race participants are responsible for the legal use of public transportation. But reality is, they will let you on with your race medal. It\u2019s a couple blocks to the Back Bay station from the family meeting area.\n\nGo to Sam Adams and on to Doyles.\u00a0Sam Adams is fun. They give you a brewery tour. (Yawn.) But then have a pretty fun tasting and give runners a commemorative glass. This is one of many special privileges your bib garners around town post-race. That is all well and good, but be sure to time your visit so you can go to Doyle\u2019s for lunch. Doyle\u2019s is an Irish Pub not far from Sam Adams. They offer a free trolley ride to and from the brewery. Honestly, that trolley ride was the absolute non-running highlight of our visit to Boston. The driver was the most fun guy I\u2019ve ever met and we were all sorry when the ride was o... (truncated)",

        "text":"Sunday, September 23, 2007\n\nDoes Louisville suck?\n\nThe short answer is yes, but there's more to it than that.\n\nThe big news Saturday night was that Syracuse managed to play Louisville's kind of game and edge them out for a victory, putting a serious damper on the Cardinals' chances to go to a BCS game. But this loss shouldn't have been as surprising as people thought.\n\nFirst, Syracuse may have been 0-3 coming in, but they played...just kidding, Syracuse got crushed by three currently unranked teams: Washington, Iowa, and Illinois. And Kentucky appears to really have something going this year, a pleasant surprise for the people of the bluegrass state who've been disappointed with Louisville so far.\n\nBut let's look farther back, at a game that screamed to us that this Louisville team wasn't the superior team of last year. I give you exhibit A, Louisville vs. Middle Tennessee State, a team that lost to Florida Atlantic by 13 the week before they played Louisville. The Blue Raiders put up 42 on Louisville, scoring on plays of the following distances: 78, 23, 24, 39, 1, 79. It was clear after looking at this game's stats that, barring some complete transformation, Louisville was going to have trouble beating any teams with reasonable talent. And go figure, Kentucky and Syracuse edged the Cardinals.\n\nWhat I found amazing was that at the half against Syracuse, Louisville was down 21-7, and on ESPN News, Robert Smith declared that Syracuse would get blown out of the game. It wasn't even like he was meaning to be bold or anything, he just completely discounted the Orange's ability to play football. Somehow, Smith seemed to be oblivious to the fact that Louisville couldn't stop anyone, despite back-to-back games giving up at least 40 points.\n\nIs the entire country retarded like this? Are wins and losses and rankings the only things that people look at when trying to evaluate teams? Louisville should've gone down in the rankings after their suspect game against Middle Tennessee, and they should've dropped out of the top 25 after they lost to Kentucky. They're obviously unranked now, but the rankings have made a lot of people more surprised than they needed to be. Louisville is the new Kansas State. They have a potent offense, but can't really stop anyone, so get used to some .500 seasons down south.\n\nNo comments:\n\nTop 500 Songs - Stevie Wonder, Dionne Warwick\n\nStevie Wonder is one of the greatest performers in American history.

        "text":"Let\u2019s Find A New Team For Jay Ajayi\n\nJay Ajayi is one of the more high-profile names still left on the free agent market, but it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that he\u2019s yet to find a new contract after hitting free agency in March. The former Eagle and Dolphin has never ranked favorably in running back efficiency metrics, and his injury history is concerning. After tearing his right ACL while at Boise State, Ajayi dealt with hamstring, rib, shoulder, head, and shoulder issues in the NFL before suffering another torn ACL \u2014 this time, on his left knee \u2014 in 2018.\n\nHowever, there are still some reasons to be optimistic about Ajayi\u2019s future. As recently as 2016, Ajayi finished seventh in\u00a0Football Outsiders\u2019 DYAR, which measures value over a replacement level player. The following year, he ranked 10th in broken tackle\/per touch percentage, a statistic that, as Josh Hermsmeyer of FiveThirtyEight.com\u00a0tweets, is mostly under the back\u2019s control and thus a reliable metric for evaluating the position.\n\nAs training camp approaches, let\u2019s take a look at a few teams that could still use a back like Ajayi:\n\nHouston Texans\n\nHouston finally made investments in its offensive line over the offseason, adding free agent Matt Kalil on a one-year pact and using two of its first three draft picks on offensive tackles Tytus Howard and Max Scharping. How much Kalil (who hasn\u2019t played well or been able to stay healthy in recent years) or small-school projects Howard and Scharping will actually help in 2019 is unclear, but the Texans needed to do something to improve its rushing attack, which ranked just 26th in DVOA a season ago.\n\nThe next step might be adding a complement to running back Lamar Miller, whose share of Houston\u2019s carry total has decreased in each of his three seasons with the club. The Texans don\u2019t have many serviceable options behind Miller, as the leading candidate for No. 2 duties is D\u2019Onta Foreman, who handled only seven carries in 2019 after recovering from a torn Achilles. Ajayi could give Houston another dimension on offense while protecting the team against a Miller injury.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nThe Colts are the only team to have actually hosted Ajayi thus far, doing so when free agency originally opened back in March. However, reports quickly followed indicating no deal was imminent between Indianapolis and Ajayi, and the Colts clearly haven\u2019t had the urge to sign him since. Indy already has a solid rushing infrastructure, boasting one of the NFL\u2019s best offensive lines and three competent backs in Marlon Mack, Jordan Wilkins, and Nyheim Hines. Indianapolis doesn\u2019t need Ajayi, but he\u2019d be interesting on a cheap deal.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers\n\nWe don\u2019t know how Melvin Gordon\u2018s holdout is going to end. Will he and the Chargers agree to a deal? If not, will he sit out the entire season like Le\u2019Veon Bell did in 2018? These are currently unanswerable questions, but if Gordon does miss game action as threatened, Los Angeles could potentially need another running back.\n\nAustin Ekeler and Justin Jackson both proved to be efficient when filling in for Gordon when the latter suffered a sprained MCL last season, and Ekeler, especially, has been extremely proficient in the passing game when called upon. In the event of a Gordon absence, the Chargers could probably get by with a duo of Ekeler and Jackson, but Ajayi would give Los Angeles another option capable of handling carries.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nThe Buccaneers finished 24th in\u00a0rushing DVOA\u00a0and\u00a028th in expected points gained by their rushing attack in 2018, but did next to nothing to address their backfield during the offseason. Sure, Tampa Bay added Bruce Arians favorite Andre Ellington and undrafted free agent Bruce Anderson to its roster, but the lack of meaningful reinforcements means the club will once again be relying on veteran Peyton Barber and 2018 second-round pick Ronald Jones as its primary ball-carriers.\n\nJones handled only 23 attempts during his rookie campaign, but the USC product is expected to be a larger part of the Bucs\u2019 offense this season. He\u2019s generated some buzz by gaining 13 pounds over the offseason, but adding weight has historically not been a recipe for success for running backs.\n\nJones\u2019 lack of production in his first NFL season was relatively unprecedented, especially for a second-round pick. Here are the all first- or second-round round running backs since 2010 that handled fewer than 100 carries during their respective rookie years, via Pro-Football-Reference.com:\n\nIt\u2019s not a great group! Some backs like Shane Vereen and Carlos Hyde, eventually found success, but the track of record of RBs who did next to nothing in their rookie seasons is certainly unspectacular. Barber, meanwhile, has never produced an above-average campaign, so Ajayi could be a welcome addition to Tampa Bay\u2019s running back depth chart.\n\nView Comments (4)\nnewest oldest\n\n4 comments on \u201cLet\u2019s Find A New Team For Jay Ajayi\n\n  1.

        "text":"\n\nThe heart of the difference is not ability or even talent, but desire\n\nThe purpose of life is to discover and develop your gift. The meaning of life comes from sharing your gift with others. - David Viscott\n\nSunday, April 29, 2007\n\n\"I am not fast, but I am stupid\"\n\n(quote and picture by Luis Escobar)\n\n(all other pictures are curtesy of Crew Pink Fuzzy!)\n\nMy weekend started with a drive to the airport. As I was leaving the house, I mentioned to Oleg we need to stop at REI to buy some gels - and then open a door and see a package from Cliff sponsors with my gels. Yay!\nI flew to Phoenix, AZ, where Angie picked me up, and we just began talking non-stop. This girl is so sweet and comfortable, like my own sister, and conversation flows about everything you ever wanted to say to your best friend! 2 hrs drive went in a flash, and after situating in Motel 6 we went to the pre-race dinner. Since neither one of us eats pasta, we picked some food and the supermarket and took it to the school gymnasiun where the meeting was. None of the \"fast boys\" showed up, and we joked how they dissed us, conventional runners. I've met Larry, Lisa S-B client, and a few others, but mostly they are people I don't know (interesting thing was they did know me, but I'll talk about it in report). The controversial figure of a 17 year old kid Michael Hayden came to talk, then Luis Escobar walked and said: I didn't recongnize you with you clothes on! Shh, Luis, nobody supposed to know that:) He calls me talanted, smart and beautiful, and I want to marry him:) Why is that no white American boy ever compliments women, like we some sort of middle gender? But I already discussed it in some post... We laugh, he asked why I pick this course, and I say: this is my kind of course, I don't like running all that much, I am a hiker. He looks back and responds: yes, this is what I say - I am not fast but I am stupid to hang there all day. Right there and then I decided it would be the title of my post - and if I had known how true it will be, I might have changed my decision...\n\nWe went back to the room, and I spread out all my gels, bottles, packs and carb mixes to show Angie when is what. There is no science in my racing, I take 2 gels and 2 bottle in 1.5 hrs, nothing else. So depending on how far aid stations are I split my supply. Finally we watched some stupid reality show and turned in.\n\n3 am came fast, but we were wide awake - at least until we got to the car, because driving put us into half-asleep stage. We were the last car parked at the start - the rest had been turned to the road - and happened to be behind Hal Koerner's group. I joked with him how he and the rest of elite's didn't show up at the dinner (\"uhm, church? early sleep time? doesn't fly?\") and went to check in. Kyle Skaggs was there and gave me a hag - I call him \"my favorite boy with favorite thigh muscles\", he is not only super-fast but an awesome kid, humble and friendly, and adorable too. I think of him as somebody who \"grew up in front of my eyes\" - he won his first long trail run at Capitol Peak 17M in 2004 when I won the 50k version, and then I gave him rides to his next 2 50k races he won, and I remember him looking up to me - and would you look at this kid now! He is such a sweetheart...but I digress:)\n\nI was conteplating whether or not I should start with a flashlight, but really, the light comes up in 15 min after the 5am start, and we are so tight at first, there is enough people with lights around. We sort out on single track trail right away and single-file on the wash-out. I am feeling pretty good and clicking minutes, things go well, and I am listening to my tunes. The trails are rocky - and this is an understatement. Karl Meltzer cals this course the rockiest in the country, and he is a Master on this, he should know. So we kick 'em and step on 'em, and about 3 miles in I kick one big really hard, twist my left leg landing and a crazy pain shoots right inside the left hip joint in a place where my cartilage tear is! My eyes jump out of the orbits and I see stars, tears stream out, and swear profusely - F#$@!!! It is horrific, sharp and strong, and I can't make a step. I pull to the side, holding my fists to not yell much, and everybody - everybody! - and their mother passes me. I try to move causiously, and pull to the side again. Now everybody and their father, borther and sister go by me. I still can't make a step, I wonder if I damaged my hip completely and forever. I hobble a bit, lopsided and leaping, and reach out for my prescription pain killers. Thanks to my doctor for and for saving them! I pop two and walk. Bearing weight on left leg even for a split second is a disaster. I can stretch out my right leg, but absolutely locked in pain and muscle contraction on my left side. I slowly move on to the aid station. Hiking up is a bit easier, going flat and down sucks! Eventually I come out of clearing and Angie asks me what's wrong. Well, I am not sure, I think I tore something, but I took pills and it should get better, and I will hike to the next AS and see how it goes...\n\nI switched bottles, put my pack on and moved to the next section. Luis Escobar (who was hired as an official photographer) is there yelling me: run! I am like: can't! He walks alongside me, listening to what happened, and wishes me strength. I continue walking. Whomever hasn't pass me yet, do it now. I feel like the last person on Earth, but tell myself: I pride myself in been a hiker, I power-walked 75% of this course last year, I can do the whole 100% and still get under cut off. I am not giving up, it is a far away from home race, and Angie is here for me...all those reasons flash, and I feel the pain finally easing off. I am still lopsided and can't reach out left leg, but I can make some kind of an uneven shuffle.\u00a0 By the time I get to second AS I am almost running - what Luis and Angie (taking pictures of me) notice. I do another switch of bottles and pack, thank my beautiful Angie, give Luis a kiss, and go on 3rd section.\n\nIt is hot. Have I mentioned it yet? It is 90F, all open terrain, we are high at 7,000 feet and climbing, and the air is dry. 10 miles is a lo-o-ng way, but if I only knew how long it really is...I am hiking pretty well by now, and drinking and eating from my 3 bottles, hoping just over that ridge will be an AS. Not be. I come across a snake on a trail and pinch myself to make sure I am not hallucinating. I am not, and I am petrified on snakes, so I wait for it to go away. I have a weird thought process: may be I can get bit, and then I can quit this race for a serious reason, I so don't want to continue. But then again, it's so far to an AS, I may never make it there with a snake bite. Nope, I guess not an option. I pass a creek and get a bottle of water - I am dry - and the other ridge doesn't bring the site of an AS either. I also dip my hat in the water - and it's warm so doesn't bring any relief. Every ridge after that went in hopes, for the WHOLE HOUR!! Unbelievable. I try to stay positive, and I reel in on people. This is my high, this is where I start feeling I am doing something right. I pick a person and slwoly pull behind, and then come by, say \"hi, how are you, it's hot today\" and pass on. It gives me motivation, but I am so dry, I stagger and get lightheaded. Actualy, I was staggering and fuzzy on the second stretch as well, thinking it was altitude sickness. It gets much worse here, but I keep pushing. \"I am strong. I am a real power-walker. This is a hiker's course, and I am a hiker. My best strength is mental power. This is what I am going to use - I am Russian and I am mentally strong! GI Jane, baby! Keep on pushing when others are breaking down!\" Hour...how long is an hour? Longer than you think it is when there is no water, no wind, no cloude, no tree, and you are going uphill. Who said this year's course is downhill? Does it have downhill at all? I don't see it, and when a short burst of something resembling it comes, it is so rocky and twisted, walking yet again is the only option.\n\nFinally there it is, mile 26.5. I can't talk - but neither can anybody else here - and point at my bottles and my mouth. I get a cup of cold water, a cup of coke, 2 water bottles refilled - and move on. Lots of people staying trying to recupperate, but I can't afford to loose time, Angie is waiting and worrying, I am so f$#@ng late!\n\nI stagger on, drinking, and before I know it - my bottles are emty. I am so dehydrated and heaving, I can't bear a thought of gels and mixes, so I just drink. Another creek - and I refill my bottles, and they are empty in a flash too. I come by Michael Hayden sitting on a side and try to pull him in. He walks a bit behind and disappears soon (he dropped at the next AS). I come by Larry and his friend - and he yells: I knew you'd come. I stop and explain the injury thing, and his friend says how he saw me getting it and how it didn't look good at al. Well, here I am, still moving on, lets go, boys... Despite that creek refill, I am walking on empty for 40 min before the AS, and it seems that those (aid stations) run away as we move towards them. It takes 30 min longer on each strecth than I predicted, and I can't understand it. I see Angie, and she enthusiastically tells me how many places I moved up, how well I am doing and how everybody's times are not just slow, but slower than last year's \"up\" course. The AS mile 33 looks like a hospital - runners laying under tents, sitting down, drinking, gazing...I have an urge to fall into Angie's arms and not go anywhere. Eb comes (he started 1 hr earlier) and asks me how is the day - it f%#$ed up, I say, trying to see if I want another shot of coke. My mind is far in another place, like the other side of the moon. Don't give up, Eb says. Who, me? I am not! And I walk out, almost missing the check-out point.Angie is cheerful, and it's a bliss to see her.\n\nI count my miles in \"Angie's\": I see her ...

The combination of Dallas Cowboys jersey\nthe BAA and NBL born, the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1949. played six franchises in the BAA that still exist today (Celtics, Knicks, Lakers, Pistons, Warriors and Royals.) DynastyIn Boston Celtics of the 1950s the Minneapolis Lakers won several NBA championships. But when the Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach and Bob Cousy hired acquired players such as Tommy Heinsohn and Bill Russell, the Celtics began the dynasty of the basketball in the NBA. Since 1957, the Celtics have won 11 NBA championships in 13 years. His main opponent in this season were in Minneapolis and Los Angeles Lakers. Although trained as impressive as the Celtics, the Lakers no NBA titles during this period of history have won.\nThe threat of ABA and other problemsIn the 1960s, the NFL is facing the biggest threat in history as an upstart and exciting new league called the AFL. In the last part of the decade, the NBA is facing similar problems with its new competitor, the American Basketball Association (ABA). The new league has attracted many players from the basketball star and had a quick play. The ABA is probably best known for his basketball-red, white and blue known. Finally, the ABA joined the NBA in 1976, when the Major League allows Nets, Nuggets, Spurs and Pacers in their organization.\nThe fusion does not end the problems of the NBA. It was a dark period in the history of basketball as an NBA player with many serious problems related to drugs in 1970 are facing. Rumours were rife that the basketball players were in the NBA many abuses marijuana and cocaine at this point in history. Certainly, the NBA is not unique, drug problems in 1970. But the negative image that has led to low morale, low participation and poor ratings of television.\nGlory Days: The 1980sJust when the NBA was at its lowest point in history, were two young stars of Jets 6 Sanchez AFL50th jersey\nthe league and revitalized the NBA. Larry Bird is the Boston Celtics and Earvin Magic Johnson is the Lakers in Los Angeles. In the 1980s, the Celtics won three NBA titles and the Lakers have won five. In fact, the two rivals clashed in the past three times in this decade. Older fans of basketball with the Celtics face as most NBA fans quickly for the Showtime Lakers style. More importantly, the interest of basketball fans in general leads young and old NBA arenas and ratings increased.\nWhile the Celtics and Lakers were the renovation of the old jokes in the decade of 1980, broke a skinny kid from North Carolina to the NBA scene. Once he got the NBA, Michael Jordan was consistently score 30-40 points per game. Jordan's talent knew no boundaries, both as a shooter and a jumper and tenacious fighting spirit was legendary, both as a lawyer and above all in practice. He took his team, the Chicago Bulls to collect for several years for a proper distribution of aid to the coach. But once he found the right formula, Jordan and the Bulls six NBA titles and won the Most experts agree that Michael Jordan the best basketball player in history.\nThe NBA in 21 century when retirement of Michael Jordan and the Bulls broke the team belonged to his coach, Phil Jackson joined the Lakers in Los Angeles. Jackson continued his journey by winning five NBA crowns or 11 NBA titles as head coach, most of the story. Among the players was the debate in most of the 21 century, when Kobe Bryant (notes) or LeBron James (notes) the best player in the NBA. While most agree that James is the most talented player in the NBA, Bryant is considered the best player because he won championships.\nAlthough facing the NBA is suffering many problems of Steelers 43 Polamalu jersey\ncompanies in a bad economy are still very popular is basketball and the league is very strong.
