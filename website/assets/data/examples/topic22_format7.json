General Motors Corporation bought Rapid along with the Reliance Motor Truck Company, and in 1912, the marque 'GMC Truck' was first shown at the New York International Auto Show. During World War II, GMC Truck produced trucks for the United States, and by the middle of the century, GMC had expanded into producing coaches, transit buses, emergency vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, and motor homes. Between 1962 and 1972, most GMC vehicles were equipped with quad headlights, and Chevrolet trucks were equipped with dual headlights. In 1973, GM\u2019s introduced the 'rounded line' series, which set the standard for the Chevrolet\/GMC line of trucks for over 30 years, and sister models from both brands shared most features except trim and sticker price. The year 2007 saw a divergence in style once again between the two brands. GMC's trucks, vans, and SUVs offer more options and standard features than Chevrolet's vehicles, which are positioned as entry-level offerings. Today, GMC remains a venerable automobile manufacturer that produces SUVs, light- to heavy-duty pickup trucks, and vans.\n\n\n1983 GMC Vandura G-1500 RWD 165\u00a0hp (123\u00a0kW) 275\u00a0ft\u00b7lb (373\u00a0Nm) 5049\u00a0lb (2290\u00a0kg) 55% 5.7\u00a0L\n1991 GMC Syclone AWD 280\u00a0hp (209\u00a0kW) 360\u00a0ft\u00b7lb (488\u00a0Nm) 3613\u00a0lb (1639\u00a0kg) 63% 4.3\u00a0L\n1992 GMC Typhoon AWD 280\u00a0hp (209\u00a0kW) 360\u00a0ft\u00b7lb (488\u00a0Nm) 3800\u00a0lb (1724\u00a0kg) 57% 4.3\u00a0L\n\n\n\n  1.

The project started in 1940 and was reworked in winter 1940-41. Two prototypes were built. Because of the war situation, the design work was made mostly by French engineers in Hamburg. Two aircraft were made in France by the Louis Breguet Aircraft Company at Anglet near Bayonne. The first machine made its first flight in August 1944, but due to the liberation of France by the Allies in the summer of 1944, all testing was cancelled. Despite the advanced design, both prototype airliners were scrapped after the German withdrawal. The Bv 144 would have had a crew of three and a capacity of eighteen passengers. It was powered by two 1,600-hp BMW 801MA 18-cylinder two-row radial piston engines, would have had an estimated speed of 470 km\/h (292 mph), and a range of 1,550 km (963 miles).

        "text":"Skip the auto shop - Our mechanics make house calls\n\nP0960 OBD-II Trouble Code: Pressure Control Solenoid A Control Circuit\/Open\n\ndiagnostic check engine light\n\nP0960 code definition\n\nThe P0960 code is a generic powertrain code related to the transmission, including pressure faults and sensor failures. In this case, the engine control module (ECM) has received a signal noting that the pressure control solenoid for the A control circuit is open.\n\nWhat the P0960 code means\n\nElectronically controlled valves shift and maintain the correct gears needed for optimal performance. The valve body contains both the shift solenoid valves and pressure control solenoid valves. The shift solenoid valves control the activation (or deactivation) of such items as the clutch, brakes, and engaging\/disengaging the gears.\n\nA vehicle will use one or more pressure control solenoid valves to control the hydraulic pressure in a vehicle\u2019s automatic transmission. Hydraulic pressure is generated at the pump, which is driven by the engine through the torque converter housing.\n\nA code P0960 will be stored when the transmission control module sees a fault with one of the valves, including a voltage signal stating that the A control circuit is remaining open, or not receiving the reference voltage needed to operate. .\n\nWhat causes the P0960 code?\n\nSeveral problems may cause a P0960 code including:\n\n  \u2022 Low transmission fluid\n  \u2022 Dirty transmission fluid\n  \u2022 Damaged, open, shorted, or corroded wiring or related electrical components\n  \u2022 Poor electrical connection\n  \u2022 Damaged or defective pressure control solenoid\n  \u2022 Damaged or defective ECM (rare)\n\nWhat are the symptoms of the P0960 code?\n\nSymptoms of a P0960 code may include:\n\n  \u2022 Check engine or warning light may illuminate\n  \u2022 Vehicle may shift harsh or rough\n  \u2022 Possible transmission slippage\n  \u2022 Vehicle may not shift into or out of gear\n\nHow does a mechanic diagnose the P0960 code?\n\nA mechanic may use several methods to diagnose a P0960 trouble code, including:\n\n  \u2022 Utilize an OBD-II scanner to check for a stored P0960 trouble code\n  \u2022 Check transmission fluid levels and quality\n  \u2022 Check transmission pan for clutch or other debris\n  \u2022 Perform a visual check of wiring and related electrical circuitry and components related to the pressure control solenoid A control circuit\n  \u2022 Check the wire harness from the transmission control module to the transmission for damage\n  \u2022 Check the transmission control module and transmission connectors for corrosion or damaged pins\n  \u2022 Perform a circuit check and measure resistance across the terminals\n  \u2022 Repeat test at transmission connector is resistance doesn\u2019t match manufacturer specifications\n\nCommon mistakes when diagnosing the P0960 code\n\nAt times, the pressure control solenoid or transmission control module may be replaced when the fault lies in a defective harness or poor electrical connection. It is recommended to thoroughly diagnose a P0960 trouble code for all possible causes before replacing more expensive components.\n\nHow serious is the P0960 code?\n\nBecause a vehicle\u2019s safe driving operation most likely will be impacted due to faults that store a P0960 code, this code is considered a potentially serious code. When this code appears, it is recommended to immediately take your vehicle to your local service center or mechanic for repair and diagnosis.\n\nWhat repairs can fix the P0960 code?\n\nSeveral repairs can fix a P0960 trouble code and include:\n\n  \u2022 Fill transmission fluid to manufacturer specifications\n  \u2022 Perform a full transmission flush, if necessary\n  \u2022 Repair or replace damaged or defective wiring and related electrical components\n  \u2022 Repair a damaged or defective wire harness from the transmission control module to the transmission\n  \u2022 Repair any bent or damaged pins\n  \u2022 Repair or replace damaged or defective pressure control solenoid\n  \u2022 Repair or replace damaged transmission control module\n  \u2022 Repair or replace damaged or defective ECM (rare)\n  \u2022 Clear all codes, test-drive the vehicle, and rescan to see if any codes reappear\n\nAdditional comments related to a P0960 code\n\nAs with any transmission-related trouble code, be sure to check the transmission fluid level and quality prior to any repairs.\n\nNeed help with a P0960 code?\n\nYourMechanic offers certified mobile mechanics who will come to your home or office to diagnose and repair your vehicle.

        "text":"Who Invented the Car?\n\nBenz Motor Car\nThe Benz Motor Car No. 1 is a three-wheeled, gas-powered horseless carriage.\nCredit: Philip Lange \/ Shutterstock.com\n\nThe history of the automobile is a long and winding road, and pinpointing exactly who invented the car is not a simple matter. But if you rewind the evolution of cars past GPS, past antilock brakes and automatic transmissions and even past the Model T, eventually you'll get to the Benz Motor Car No. 1, the missing link between cars and horse-drawn buggies.\n\nKarl Benz patented the three-wheeled Motor Car in 1886. It was the first true, modern automobile. Benz also patented his own throttle system, spark plugs, gear shifters, a water radiator, a carburetor and other fundamentals to the automobile. Benz eventually built a car company that still exists today as the Daimler Group.\n\nLong history of the car\n\nBenz patented the first gasoline-powered car, but he wasn't the original visionary of self-propelled vehicles. Some highlights in the history of the car:\n\n  \u2022 Leonardo da Vinci had sketched a horseless, mechanized cart in the early 1500s. Like many of his designs, it wasn't built in his lifetime.\n  \u2022 In 1769, a Frenchman named Nicholas-Joseph Cugnot built a self-propelled vehicle with a steam engine. The cart moved at a walking pace and was abandoned.\n  \u2022 Sometime between 1832 and 1839, Robert Anderson of Scotland invented the first electric carriage, which used a rechargeable battery that powered a small electric motor. The vehicles were heavy, expensive and required frequent recharging. They were abandoned in favor of gasoline-powered engines.\n\nInternal combustion engines\n\nVital to the modern automobile is the internal combustion engine. This type of engine uses an explosive combustion of fuel to push a piston within a cylinder. The piston's movement turns a crankshaft that is connected to the car's wheels of a drive shaft. Like the car itself, the internal combustion engine has a long history. An incomplete list of developments includes:\n\n  \u2022 1680: Christiaan Huygens, better known for his contributions as an astronomer, designed but never built an internal combustion engine fueled by gunpowder.\n  \u2022 1826: Englishman Samuel Brown altered a steam engine to burn gasoline and put it on a carriage, but this proto-automobile also never gained widespread adoption.\n  \u2022 1858: Jean Joseph-Etienne Lenoir patented a double-acting, electric spark-ignition internal combustion engine fueled by coal gas. He improved on that engine so it would run on petroleum, attached it to a three-wheeled wagon and traveled 50 miles.\n  \u2022 1873: American engineer George Brayton developed a two-stroke kerosene engine. It is considered to be the first safe and practical oil engine.\n  \u2022 1876: Nikolaus August Otto patented the first four-stroke engine in Germany.\n  \u2022 1885: Gottlieb Daimler invented the prototype of the modern gasoline engine.\u00a0\nKarl Benz\nKarl Benz, inventor of the first practical, modern automobile.\nCredit: Daimler.com\n\nInnovative and entrepreneurial\n\nKarl Benz gets the credit for inventing the automobile because his car was practical, used a gasoline-powered internal-combustion engine and worked like modern cars do today.\n\nBenz was born in 1844 in Karlsruhe, a city in southwest Germany. His father was a railway worker who died in an accident when Benz was 2 years old. Although poor, Benz's mother supported him and his education. He was admitted to the University of Karlsruhe at age 15 and graduated in 1864 with a mechanical engineering degree.\n\nBenz's first venture of an iron foundry and sheet-metal workshop flopped. However his new bride, Bertha Ringer, used her dowry to fund a new factory to build gas engines. With the profits Benz was free to start building a horseless, gas-powered carriage.\n\nBenz had built three prototypes of his Motor Car in private by 1888, when Bertha decided it was time for some press. Bertha took the latest model in the early morning and drove her two teenage sons 66 miles to her mother's home. She had to improvise repairs along the way with shoe leather, a hair pin and her garter.\n\nThe successful trip showed Benz how to improve the car, and showed a dubious public that automobiles were useful. Benz demonstrated the Model 3 Motorwagen at the World's Fair in Paris the following year.\n\nBenz died in 1929, just two years after he merged with fellow car-maker Gottlieb Daimler's company to form what is today the Daimler Group, manufacturer of the Mercedes-Benz.\n\nEditor's Recommendations\n\nMore from LiveScience\nAuthor Bio\nLauren Cox\n\nLauren Cox\n\nLauren Cox is a contributing writer for Live Science.

They were used on the Eastern and Scottish Regions of British Railways. The first two batches were delivered as 11136-11143 (later D2550-D2557) and 11161-11176 (later D2558-D2573) Subsequent locos were delivered as D2574-D2618\n\nThe British Rail Class D2\/5 built by Andrew Barclay Sons & Co. were reported in several sources as having received the TOPS class number 05,[1][2][3] though this was in error, and they are not listed as such in the latest works by Marsden, 2011.[4][5]\n\n\nMost were withdrawn early and replaced by classes 03 and 04 with the exception of D2554, which was transferred to the Isle of Wight in 1966 to aid the electrification of the Island Line. Owing to its apparent suitability for working on the island, it was retained in working order and given the TOPS number 05 001. It was transferred to departmental stock in 1981, being given the number 97803,[6] and remained in service until 1985, when it was withdrawn and sold to the Isle of Wight Steam Railway.\n\nDidcot Railway Centre has an industrial example (numbered DL26 and built to a design based on the Class 05) preserved after being used by the National Coal Board in the northeast. DL26 has a larger engine (264\u00a0hp, 60\u00a0hp larger than the Class 05s) and a higher bonnet to accommodate it. It is currently painted in a British Railways black livery with an early crest on the cab sides, a livery it never carried in service; it was an industrial locomotive from built until preservation. It was the main shunter on the site until displaced by a Class 08, though it still sees maintenance and use in its shunting role. It cannot be used on passenger trains due to its lack of vacuum brakes. The Isle of Wight Steam Railway's own 05001\/D2554 can be seen frequently but it cannot run passenger trains, due to the Island's unique vintage air braked rolling stock.\n\nTechnical details[edit]\n\nThe engine is a Gardner 8-cylinder, 4 stroke 8L3 of 204\u00a0hp (152\u00a0kW) connected to a Hunslet 4-speed gearbox through a Hunslet patent friction clutch. Final drive is via a Hunslet reversing gearbox and jackshaft.\n\n\nFour class 05 Diesel Shunters have been preserved:\n\n\nClass 05 is being made as a kit and a ready-to-run model in OO gauge by Silver Fox Models,[7] and has been released in OO gauge by Heljan (August 2015).\n\n\n  1. ^ Strickland 1983, pp.\u00a040, 41, 173.\n  2. ^ Haresnape 1984, p.\u00a050.\n  3. ^ Marsden 1984, p.\u00a099.\n  4. ^ Marsden 2011a, pp.\u00a054-55.\n  5. ^ Marsden 2011b, pp.\u00a090-92.\n  6. ^\n  7. ^ \"Class 05 0-6-0 Hunslet Shunter\".

        "text":"FVL damage reporting\n\nECG in conjunction with AIAG, the Automotive Industry Action Group in North America, published version 4\u00a0of the Finished Vehicle Logistics Transport Damage Reporting in 2019.\n\nThe two associations represent the two largest markets in the world for finished vehicle logistics and began collaborative discussions in 2007. More recently this has become a closer and more regular co\u2011operation in order to develop processes and manuals together with the aim that they could become global industry standards that would be widely accepted in the finished vehicle logistics sector and the automotive industry.\n\nThis has led to the \u2018Finished Vehicle Logistics Transport Damage Codes\u2019 document launched this month as a joint publication. Originally published as a set of common damage codes by AIAG these were promoted as \u2018Global Damage Codes\u2019 by both parties. Since then ECG has worked to promote these codes in the European market as an industry standard to improve efficiency through harmonisation. This builds on the core ECG objective of \u2018standardisation\u2019 as a means of improving efficiency for operators in the vehicle logistics sector.\n\nDuring transportation, when the party responsible for finished vehicles changes, they are inspected for any missing parts as well as for any damage including scratches and dents. The damage is reported through a standard five-digit set of codes. These codes focus on three areas: type, location and severity of the damage. AIAG\u2019s and ECG\u2019s common document gives guidance to facilitate the localisation of the damage incurred, with the help of vehicle \u2018splat\u2019 charts for better visualisation.\n\nThe common document covers other FVL-related issues besides the Damage Codes \u2013 such as key placement within new vehicles during transport and storage. Every manufacturer has its own preferences for the key placement in new cars, a situation which can cause a lot of headaches for the companies that handle them and is crying out for standardisation.\n\nIt is hoped that eventually widespread adoption of the Damage Codes on the two continents will lead to the acceptance of the codes on other markets as well and thus become globally recognised. AIAG and ECG are now in discussion regarding other areas that would benefit the industry from standardisation.\n\nClick here to download the M-22 Finished Vehicle Logistics Transport Damage Reporting document",

GATTEL (Gabinete para a Travessia do Tejo em Lisboa) was established, the purpose of which was to decide on the location of the Crossing, as well as to co-ordinate and control the procedures necessary to promote its construction and operation as a private concession.\n1994 (April) LUSOPONTE, a consortium of Portuguese, British and French companies, won the international public tender for the concession to design, construct, finance and operate the new crossing.\n1995 (February) Vasco da Gama Bridge Construction was begun.\n1998 (29 March) \u2013 Vasco da Gama Bridge opened to Traffic\nThe location of the New Crossing was chosen in order to lighten traffic on the 25 April Bridge and to prevent heavy traffic, travelling from north to the south of the country, passing through the city of Lisbon. This project, which was completed in a very tight schedule in order to allow for easy access to Expo\u201998, also included an expropriation and re-housing project, which for the first time in Portugal was undertaken by a private entity. One of the ever-present concerns of this huge project was the preservation of its surrounding environment, resulting in a vast environmental programme. This program was implemented from the very onset of construction and included, among other things, the\nSamouco Salt Pans located in the Special Protection Zone. The construction of Vasco da Gama Bridge over the river Tagus by Lusoponte has now passed into the annals of the history of civil engineering as one of the largest and most\nsuccessful projects of the 20th Century. This Project gained international recognition when it was awarded first prize by the prestigious Ibero-Americana Institution of Architecture and Civil Engineering in the year 2000.\n\nNorth Viaduct:\n\nA 488m long viaduct which spans the main railway line and several local access roads, with a variable deck width to accommodate the slip roads.

The works were managed by Campenon Bernard SGE.\nVasco da Gama bridge\n\nVasco da Gama bridge\n\nMain Bridge:\n\nThe Main Bridge is a spectacular concrete structure as the deck it is stayed to main pylons. Its central span is of 420 m and the side spans of 203 m. The central pylons are 150 m high and the deck gives a clearance of 47 m above water level on the navigation channel called North Channel. The deck is a mix structure composed with concrete slabs laying on steel cross beams casted on two side concrete beams where the stays are linked to the pylons. The H-shaped north and south pylons, stand on foundations designed to withstand impact from a 30.000 tonne ship travelling with a speed cruise of 12 nuts. Each foundation of these pylons are casted on 44 precast piles with 2,2 m diameter which are bored up to 90 m. The Main Bridge works were managed by Campenon Bernard SGE.\n\nCentral Viaduct:\n\nThe construction of the 6,351m Central Viaduct was carried out using double pre-cast units with 78 m long weighing 2,200 tonnes placed on 81 piers. The foundation of each pair of piers are cast on 8 driven piles, with 1.7 m diameter reaching sometimes 65 m deep on the river bed. The deck is less than 14m above water level for most of its length but rises to 30 m over two navigation channels, the Barcas Channel and the Samora Channel with spans of 130 m to accommodate medium sized vessels. The piers located on these two channels were also designed to withstand ship impact. Five of the deck sections have wider edges to provide for emergency vehicle parking. A huge\u00a0 pre-casting yard at Seixal, 22 kms downstream from the bridge, was used to manufacture concrete pre-cast units for this viaduct. The deck sections were made in eight pieces, stitched into 78 m long beams and then it was applied the use of pre-stressed cables. The deck beams where then transported to the site on the giant crane vessel Rambiz. The yard worked to a schedule, producing one beam every two days.\n\nSouth Viaduct:\n\nVasco da Gama bridge\n\nVasco da Gama bridge\n\nThe South Viaduct with 3.825 metres long consists in a twin deck with 45 metres spans, which were, cast in situ using twin launching girders. The 85 groups of 4 piers of this Viaduct are cast partially on land and partially on marine driven piles. This Viaduct land section crosses the Samouco Salt Pans an environment area for birds. This Viaduct was constructed on a temporary embankment, which was removed after the works conclusion. The construction was carried out by Somague.\n\nSouth Access:\n\nThe 3,9 km South Access links the Vasco da Gama Bridge with the South Interchange mainly through agricultural land. The most closed local links are Setubal (A12 motorway) and with Alcochete and Montijo (Coina Ring). The Toll Plaza is located about halfway along this stretch south\/north bound and incorporates 12 booths with cash or automatic systems means of payment. On both sides of the crossing the driver can find a fully service area, close to the South Viaduct.

Knowing ahead of time about procedures for boarding the aircraft, stowage of assistive devices including a wheelchair, assistance from the cabin crew, etc., is the key to having a smooth trip\", states Terry Moakley of the United Spinal Association.\n\nThe United Spinal Association has authored a really straightforward, practical guide to air travel for passengers with disabilities. It is in a question and answer format, and really covers all angles from how far ahead you must be at the airport, to whether you must notify the airline in advance of specific requirements.\n\nMost airlines have medical departments, often referred to as meda desks by those within the industry. They are not only used to determine whether someone is fit to travel let's say after a surgery, but also for items such as oxygen requests. The pamphlet, Accessible Air Travel: A Guide for People with Disabilities is available in PDF format.\n\nMoakley continues, \"Accessible Air Travel is organized in a question and answer format that covers the major provisions of the federal Air Carrier Access Act, as amended, and its implementing regulations. Subjects covered are making reservations, advance notice requirements, seating assignments, security screening, airline liability for adaptive equipment, airport accessibility, boarding assistance, aircraft accessibility, equipment storage, and service accommodations...it also contains important information about complaint procedures for resolving a violation at the airport by a designated airline representative, or more formally in writing to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\"\n\nWhat is really helpful too, is that it explains why, for example, some passengers cannot sit in an exit row seat, such as being under 15 or not being able to open the door in case of emergency. Although it deals with regulations in the US, it is pretty universal in terms of the information for most countries. There may be slight differences in other countries, but really it is an invaluable guide for passengers with varying degrees of mobility restrictions or other disabilities.\n\n\u00a92014 About.com.

        "text":"Airport History\n\nLocated in Sebastian, Florida, Sebastian Municipal Airport is a small general aviation airport located in the north coastal region of Indian River County. Similar to other facilities serving World War II, the approximate 1,025-acre airport was built by the United States Navy in 1943 (known then as Roseland Satellite Field) as a naval flight training station. The military paid approximately $1,300 for the property in 1943. The aviation facility was transferred by the War Assets Administration, as part of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, on January 29, 1959, to the City of Sebastian. Upon taking responsibility, a provision was written in reference to the Federal Surplus Property Act, that the airport would be used without unfair discrimination solely for aviation purposes. This provision provided that the property be given back to the United States in the event of noncompliance with any terms and conditions of the deed.\n\nSince its acquisition in 1959, Sebastian Municipal Airport (now 620 acres) has been maintained and operated by the City of Sebastian. Since the transfer of ownership from the U.S. Government, Sebastian has undergone numerous facility changes and improvements. The noted championship Sebastian Municipal Golf Course was built in 1981 on a 155-acre plot of land occupying a large portion of the airport property. Local area flight-training greatly increased operations at the airport in the mid- to late- 1980s. Currently, a Fixed Based Operator (FBO) occupys the west side of the airfield, and frequent skydiving activity accounts for a large portion of operations at the airport.\n\nThe addition of a number of commercial and private general aviation hangars and related aprons were developed along the west quadrant of the field. No identifiable existing structures stand from the airport's military days. Over the years, there have been other changes made to the airport. Some of the more significant projects, going backward chronologically, have included:\n\n  \u2022 Construction of the Airport Adminisration Building\n  \u2022 Closing of R\/W 13\/31 amd Re-Opening of R\/W 10\/28\n  \u2022 Center 75 feet of Runway 5\/23 \u00a0reconstructed and 37.5 feet of both sides of the runway resealed and rejuvenated (completed during 1997)\n  \u2022 Installation of LIRL on Runway 5\/23\n  \u2022 The closing of Runway 18\/36 as an active runway. This pavement was then converted into a taxiway and apron.\n\nSome of the most notable improvements, which have changed the look of the airfield, have occurred since the last Master Plan Update. For example, general aviation facilities have been constructed on the west side of the airport, consisting of several new T hangars and a miscellaneous inventory of skydive training facilities.\n\nThe airport is directly regulated by the City of Sebastian and is a Department of the City, under the City Manager.\n\nIn its current role, the airport focuses primarily on serving general aviation. The airport does currently support and accommodate recreational activity, and it sees itself trying to attract additional users in this category in the future. The airport also accommodates flight training activity \u00a0The airport could support SATS related air taxi operations. The airport's future role is limited primarily by manmade and environmental factors. The airport sees itself experiencing significant growth in the coming years. Management's goal is to provide for an on-site corporate industrial park using the 143 acres gained by closing Runway 13\/31. Management would also like to attract additional aviation services and construct additional T-hangars.\n\nGeneral aviation operations by corporate and business users are present at the airport. The airport estimates that 10 percent of its annual general aviation operations are business related. Approximately 25 percent of the airport's based aircraft are owned by local businesses. The airport also attracts a number of transient or visiting general aviation aircraft.",

        "text":"Duty Free Shop airport | NRT | Tokyo Narita\n\n\n\nNRT | Tokyo Narita\n\nAt present this country does not permit Duty Free on arrival. But, you can buy your duty free on departure from this airport and if facilities are currently available they will be featured below, where a link will take you to an online pre-order website. Almost all international airports have duty and tax-free outlets where you can shop in the departure lounge for your outbound journey. If not, you can now book pre-order with many airlines, or purchase at your international gateway airport.\n\nSome countries like Canada and Japan are studying the introduction of arrival duty free shopping as it will bring new revenues to airports and also avoid the confusion encountered by travellers with the transit of liquids on aircraft.\n\nAlready, Bermuda, Jamaica and Grenada have introduced arrivals shops in their baggage claim areas of their airport terminals, the terminal arrival shops in the main Swiss airports are now open too.\n\nIn Europe (EU Member States), some airports now have arrival shops and even though these airport stores are not duty free (as this is not allowed within the European Community), prices are good and shopping at arrival is convenient. Convenience and Food Operators like Spar, 7-Eleven, Marks & Spencer and Tescos are also opening more shops in the baggage claim and arrival areas, as are news outlets like WH Smith or Hudson News.\n\nAirports are gradually introducing online pre-order duty free shopping, using a similar method to car-hire bookings. Within the next few years you will be able to pre-order goods from your computer or smartfone before you travel and just collect the goods on your departure or after arrival. Many airlines already have this facility and later this year we will introduce a global airline inflight catalogue site where you can browse the goods and pre-order for delivery during your flight.\n\nThe airline carry-on baggage rules and charges can also be confusing for travelers, you can find the basic rules in our customs section, but shopping when you arrive or inflight, removes these security problems for passengers.\n\nSome airline and airport retailers are yet to publish their online duty free prices and catalogues, others have now started incorporating online pre-order facilities.\n\nWe will publish the details for this airport as soon as they are available and where relevant to this airport, publish the airline in-flight price list, enabling you to make a comparison of the available products and prices.",

        "text":"Fighter Flight\n\nStations are large units that contain at least thirty-two aircraft (usually from sixteen to ninety-six aircraft, sometimes more). A station is one of the third largest unit, next to a command, then an air force.\n\n\nStations will permanently contain any amount of squadrons, but they usually range from two to six. The amount rarely surpasses ten. Stations will contain at least one training squadron (which is never assigned to a wing) and the rest are active squadrons. All squadrons in a given station will operate the same type of aircraft, whether it be a CF-18, a UH-60L, C-130, AH-64 or some other aircraft.\n\nIn some cases, however rare, a station may have mixed units. This will only happen when a type of aircraft is being phased out of service. For example, if the ZXAF starts using F-35 Lightning II fighters to replace its current CF-18 Hornets, fighter stations may have a mix of some squadrons still operating their CF-18's, and some operationg brand new F-35's.\n\nThe station contains an airbase, some squadrons and a staff. The base staff contains multiple teams of air traffic control and runway maintenance. There are usually two teams of runway directors and caretakers. The two teams are led by a flight sergeant, and each team is led by a sergeant. The teams are further divided into two smaller teams, each led by a corporal. These smaller teams also contain three aircraftmen, leading aircraftmen and senior aircraftmen. One team is usually in charge of base maintenance (caring for the runways, airpads and hangars) and taxiing the aircraft, while the other team will direct aircraft during takeoff and landing.\n\nIn air traffic control, there are two teams of radar operators (each led by a sergeant and split into two smaller, corporal-led teams) which are led by a flight sergeant. There are also the maintenance teams, which are overall led by a flight sergeant, and have one quartermaster per two squadrons, who are all sergeants. The maintenance crews, air traffic control crews and base crews are all led by a master warrant officer, and have a warrant officer second in command.\n\nThe command staff contains a commander (group captain or wing commander), a second in command (squadron leader), a quartermaster (chief warrant officer), a medical officer (master warrant officer), an administrative officer (master warrant officer), an intelligence officer (warrant officer) and a signals officer (warrant officer).\n\n\nStations function as permanent housing for two to six squadrons and are also the field training units for pilots. A station is never deployed on the 'field', but rather may have its squadrons deployed. It is extremely rare to ever find an entire station deployed all in one wing or group.\n\n\nThere are any number of squadrons in a station, though it usually ranges from two to six, rarely going over ten. There can be any number of stations within a given command (which usually covers a provincial area, such as the ZXAF's Royal Ontario Command), and there are any number of commands within an air force. These air forces are usually divided by country or small group of countries, such as the ZXAF's Canadian First Air Force. Stations are named by their location, and a number. For example, the Number One Station Toronto, located in Toronto, Ontario.\n\n\n2-6 Squadrons (33 to 96 airmen)\n\n5-8 Sergeants\n\n3 Flight Sergeants\n\n3 Warrant Officers\n\n3 Master Warrant Officers\n\n1 Chief Warrant Officer\n\n1 Flight Lieutenant\/Squadron Leader\n\n1 Wing Commander\/Group Captain\n\nZX Clan Air Force UnitsEdit",
