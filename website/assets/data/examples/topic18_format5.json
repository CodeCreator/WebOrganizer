        "text":"\n\nThe Suppressive Person is also known as the Anti-Social Personality. Within this category one finds Napoleon, Hitler, the unrepentant killer and the drug lord. But if such are easily spotted, if only from the bodies they leave in their wake, Anti-Social Personalities also commonly exist in current life and often go\u00a0undetected.\n\nThe basic reason the Suppressive Person behaves as he or she does lies in a hidden terror of others. To such a person every other being is an enemy, an enemy to be covertly or overtly destroyed. The fixation is that survival itself depends on \u201ckeeping others down\u201d or \u201ckeeping people ignorant.\u201d If anyone were to promise to make others stronger or brighter, the Suppressive Person would suffer the utmost\u00a0agony.\n\nBecause of this, the Suppressive Person seeks to upset, continuously undermine, spread bad news about and denigrate betterment activities and groups. Thus the Anti-Social Personality is also against what Scientology is about\u2014helping people become more able and improving conditions in society. As anyone can think of many examples of a Suppressive Person, this concept is not limited to Scientology. However, when such a person is connected to Scientology, for the good of the Church and the individuals in it, such a person is officially labeled a Suppressive Person so that others will know not to associate with\u00a0them.\n\nTo be declared a Suppressive Person is extremely rare and results in expulsion from the Scientology religion. This occurs in instances of serious offenses against the Scientology faith and can also occur when an individual is found to be actively working to suppress the well-being of others. This can be done through criminal acts already recognized by society as unlawful or through the commitment of acts deemed Suppressive Acts in the Scientology Justice Codes\u2014which includes the Suppressive Act of publicly renouncing the faith, an act which in Scientology, as well as almost every religion, is grounds for automatic\u00a0expulsion.\n\nWhen someone has been expelled from the religion, that person loses both his or her fellowship with the Church as well as with other Scientologists. The condition lasts until they have been restored to good standing.\u00a0Once the person has been restored to good standing, the prohibition against fellowship with other Scientologists is lifted. Similar practices have been part of religious communities for thousands of years and have been recognized by courts of law as a fundamental\u00a0right.",

        "text":"\n\n10 Church Planting Movement FAQs\n\n10 Church Planting Movement FAQs\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 What is a CPM?\n\nA definition for Church Planting Movements (CPMs) that has held sway for more than a decade is: \u201ca rapid multiplication of indigenous churches planting churches that sweeps through a people group or population segment.\u201d1\n\nNo one recalls who first coined the term \u201cChurch Planting Movements,\u201d though it appears to be a modification of Donald McGavran\u2019s landmark \u201cPeople Movements\u201d adapted to emphasize the distinctive of generating multiplying indigenous churches.\n\n2.\u00a0 What are you calling a church?\n\nWith more than 40,000 Christian denominations in the world today, it\u2019s not surprising that there is no consensus on what constitutes a church. Some mission agencies and denominations have very precise definitions for a church while others have no definition whatsoever.2 Church Planting Movements exhibit a wide range of sizes and types of church, varying with the cultural context in which they emerge. For this reason, what some may call a church, others might classify as simply a gathering, home fellowship or \u2018new work.\u2019\n\nBut this FAQ is what do you call a church? In my 2004 publication, Church Planting Movements, I allowed significant latitude in church identification by accepting self-designation. In other words, if those involved in the movement see themselves as a community of believers or church, I am unwilling to contradict them. This is not to say all churches are of equal quality. Churches can be more or less healthy.\n\nAt its core, a church is a community of believers seeking to obediently follow Jesus Christ. From God\u2019s perspective, church is a continuation of what Jesus began 2,000 years ago. This is why Paul and Luke frequently refer to the church as \u201cthe body of Christ.\u201d\n\nIn CPMs we have seen churches range in size from an average of 11.3 baptized members in Ying Kai\u2019s Asian T4T movement to 85 in the Bhojpuri movement of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to 35 members assessed in 2002 in the average Isa Jamaat of Bangladesh.\n\nThough size and expression may vary, good ecclesiology is vital to healthy CPMs. More than one rapidly growing movement has evaporated as a result of inadequate church formation. Church matters.\n\nIn South Asia, we developed a CPM ecclesiology teaching tool called \u201cA Handy Guide to Healthy Churches\u201d as an orality-friendly way of teaching new believers how to develop healthy reproducing churches.3 In northeast India, CPM missionaries Jeff Sundell along with Nathan and Kari Shank have developed a simple and ingenious \u201cChurch Health Mapping\u201d tool for tracking and developing churches from inception to maturity.4\n\n3.\u00a0 What are CPM Best Practices?\n\nBecause there are better and worse examples of CPMs and CPM churches, why not learn from and emulate the best? The problem is that our work often occurs in isolation, particularly when we labor in restricted access fields where everyone communicates in a very guarded manner. Our knowledge exists in silos that do not allow for interchange with the broader community of learning.\n\nNowhere is this more true than in the world of CPMs. A CPM breaks out in one corner of the world with dramatic speed and vitality, but with weak doctrine and orthodoxy. In another corner of the world, a movement exhibits tremendous fidelity to Scripture but struggles in community transformation. Someone has said, \u201cIf the body of Christ only knew what the body of Christ knows, the body of Christ would know all it needs to know to do the work of Christ in the world.\u201d\n\nCPM Best Practicing is about the body of Christ learning from the body of Christ the most effective practices in being, doing, and multiplying churches among every nation tribe and tongue. How do we do this? If you\u2019re reading this article, you\u2019re off to a good start.\n\n4.\u00a0 When did CPMs start?\n\nUndoubtedly Church Planting Movements have been around since the first century of the Christian era. You only have to read between the lines to see Church Planting Movements as the back-story for the rise of Christianity from Christ to Constantine. In his Book of Acts, Luke reported that: \u201call the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord\u201d (Acts 19:10) and Paul commended the Thessalonians through whom \u201cthe Lord\u2019s message\u2026 has become known everywhere\u201d (1 Thess. 1:8), and then near the end of his life could declare that \u201cthere is no more place for me to work in these regions\u201d (Romans 15:23), because of his desire \u201cto preach the gospel where Christ was not known\u201d (Romans 15:20).\n\nPliny, the governor of the distant province of Bithynia writing to the emperor Trajan about 50 years later warned that \u201c\u2026many persons of every age, every rank, and also of both sexes are and will be endangered. For the contagion of this superstition has spread not only to the cities but also to the villages and farms. [Pliny to Trajan ca. AD 111]5\n\nLater that century, Tertullian spoke confidently to his Roman persecutors of the remarkable spread of the still fledgling church:\nWe are but of yesterday, and yet we have filled all the places that belong to you \u2014 cities, islands, forts, towns, exchanges, the military camps themselves, tribes, town councils, the palace, the senate, the market-place; we have left you nothing but your temples. (Tertullian\u2019s Plea for Allegiance, A.2)6\n\nK.S. Latourette\u2019s History of the Expansion of Christianity7 chronicles scores of movements to Christ through the Church\u2019s 20-century history. But by the 19th and 20th centuries, the belief in movements was on the wane in Western missions.\n\nA prophetic voice to the contrary was sounded by Anglican missionary Roland Allen whose 1927 The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church8 envisioned churches multiplying exponentially throughout the world. A generation later, Donald McGavran showed how such a movement would occur with his 1954 Bridges of God.9\u00a0 A generation later, missionaries saw the realization of these insights with the appearance of Church Planting Movements.10\n\n5.\u00a0 How many CPMs are there?\n\nDr. Jim Haney, director of the IMB\u2019s Global Research Department, regularly tracks several thousand people groups and cities. Reports come through the IMB\u2019s more than 5,000 missionaries serving in 185 countries as well as a partnering network of evangelical sources called HIS, the Harvest Information System.11\n\nThe Global Research Department monitors key result areas in evangelism and church planting. When a population meets three key result criteria, they automatically register on what the Global Research Department calls its \u201cCPM Watch List.\u201d The three criteria are:\n\n  \u2022 A 25% Annual Growth Rate in Total Churches for the past two years\n  \u2022 A 50% Annual Growth Rate in New Churches for the past two years\n  \u2022 Field-based affirmation that a CPM is emerging.\n\nBased upon these three criteria, as of the end of the 2008 calendar year, there are 201 people groups or population segments that have risen to the CPM Watch List.\n\n6.\u00a0 What is the fastest growing CPM?\n\nThe fastest growing CPM assessed to date is occurring today in a restricted access country in Asia. The movement which began with a new missionary assignment in November 2000 has exceeded any other movement we\u2019ve seen with more than 1.7 million baptisms and more than 150,000 new church starts. The missionary God has used to catalyze this movement is a Chinese-American named Ying Kai. Kai calls his work \u201cTraining for Trainers\u201d or T4T.12\n\n7.\u00a0 How long do CPMs last?\n\nThis varies from place to place. We have instances of CPMs that began more than a decade ago and continue to grow at an annual growth rate that would qualify as an ongoing movement. We also know of movements that surged rapidly, only to halt and even implode after just a few years. This points to the importance of learning and implementing best practices.\n\n8.\u00a0 How do you assess CPMs?\n\nGreat question! Rather than answer that question briefly here, we will direct you to Jim Slack\u2019s longer article on the topic in this same publication (p. 12). Jim has years of missionary experience as the Southern Baptist International Mission Board\u2019s Church Growth Analyst.\n\n9.\u00a0 Have you ever been duped?\n\nIn short, yes. Jesus warned us to be \u201cwise as serpents.\u201d In both formal and informal CPM assessments we continue to be surprised by what we uncover. Consider these five of many that could be described:\n\n  1. In Western Europe, a missionary reported an emerging CPM in great detail for more than a year before his fabrications were unearthed, and he was dismissed from his organization.\n  2. On the other hand, a missionary in India reported at least 50,000 baptisms only to have a thorough (and skeptical) CPM assessment determine that there were at least 200,000 baptisms and perhaps as many as 400,000.\n  3. An Internet charlatan claiming to be a CPM catalyst in China and associated with the website was exposed when he solicited donations from a Finnish Pentecostal missions organization. The Finnish agency discovered the truth when they sought a reference from the webmaster who exposed the deception.\n  4. A missionary serving in Nepal reported thousands of house church plants. An assessment a few years later revealed that the house churches had been assimilated into 32 mega-cell churches that had formed in the wake of the CPM.\n  5. The missionary reporting the fastest growing CPM in the world with 1.7 million baptisms and 150,000 church plants in less than a decade, was found to be under-reporting his numbers by nearly 40 percent, in order to avoid any charges of inflation, duplication or exaggeration.\n\nIn addition to the occasional bogus movement are the aborted movements. In several locations, well-intentioned foreign dependency has intersected a promising movement, sapping it of its vitality.13 In other places, it has simply been impossible to ascertain whether a movement is underway or not. When this is the case, it is always best to simply say, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d The cause of Christ is n... (truncated)",

        "text":"2148 Michelson Dr, Irvine, CA 92612\n\nStewardship FAQ\n\nWhat is Stewardship?\n\nChris\u00adt\u00adian Stew\u00adard\u00adship is a life-style, which acknowl\u00adedges account\u00adabil\u00adi\u00adty and respon\u00adsi\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adty before God. Becom\u00ading a Stew\u00adard begins when we say we believe in God, to whom we give our love, loy\u00adal\u00adty and trust. We affirm that every aspect of our lives comes as a gift from Him. Stew\u00adards are moti\u00advat\u00aded as recip\u00adi\u00adents of God\u2019s abun\u00addant love, to respond by par\u00adtic\u00adi\u00adpat\u00ading and sup\u00adport\u00ading His plan of sal\u00adva\u00adtion and the min\u00adistries of the Church, which make sal\u00adva\u00adtion pos\u00adsi\u00adble for them and for oth\u00aders.\n\nIn the Bible, the Stew\u00adard is depict\u00aded as a per\u00adson who is giv\u00aden the respon\u00adsi\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adty of man\u00adag\u00ading some\u00adthing that belongs to the Own\u00ader, God. The Stew\u00adard as the man\u00adag\u00ader is thus account\u00adable to the Own\u00ader for all that he pos\u00adsess\u00ades and is respon\u00adsi\u00adble to return to the Lord his or her fair share in grat\u00adi\u00adtude and thanks\u00adgiv\u00ading. As God has been gen\u00ader\u00adous to us, He expects us to be gen\u00ader\u00adous toward the work of Christ and His Church. Chris\u00adt\u00adian Stew\u00adard\u00adship is the priv\u00adi\u00adlege and hon\u00ador of direct\u00adly sup\u00adport\u00ading God\u2019s work on earth through the Church.\n\nWhat is a Stewardship Commitment?\n\nA Stew\u00adard\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adment is a method by which every parish\u00adioner can active\u00adly par\u00adtic\u00adi\u00adpate in the sup\u00adport of the parish accord\u00ading to his\/her abil\u00adi\u00adties. The finan\u00adcial sup\u00adport of the parish falls into the hands of every parish\u00adioner (Stew\u00adard) who by his\/her con\u00adscience con\u00adtin\u00adu\u00adal\u00adly invests their time, tal\u00adents, and trea\u00adsures in the life of the parish.\n\nWhy is Stewardship Commitment necessary in our parish?\n\nMak\u00ading a Stew\u00adard\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adment by com\u00adplet\u00ading a Stew\u00adard\u00adship Pledge Form helps the parish cre\u00adate a bud\u00adget and man\u00adage our finances more eas\u00adi\u00adly and effec\u00adtive\u00adly, Addi\u00adtion\u00adal\u00adly, it will assist us in cre\u00adat\u00ading a data\u00adbase of vol\u00adun\u00adteers who com\u00admit to their Ortho\u00addox Stew\u00adard\u00adship through Time and Tal\u00adents. And for the parish\u00adioner, it\u2019s a mean\u00ading\u00adful expres\u00adsion of sup\u00adport for your Parish.\n\nHow is the church currently supported financially?\n\nOur Church is sup\u00adport\u00aded pri\u00admar\u00adi\u00adly through con\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtions from of our parish\u00adioners and rev\u00adenues from Church spon\u00adsored events (e.g.,The Gala, Food Fest, etc.). In recent years the Church has had to make cash with\u00addrawals from our sav\u00adings to meet expens\u00ades. While we still have cash reserves in our account, we can\u00adnot con\u00adtin\u00adue to rely on our sav\u00adings to pay for expens\u00ades. We are reach\u00ading out to encour\u00adage more of our Parish\u00adioners to become active Stew\u00adards in our Church.\n\nIs the Stewardship Commitment mandatory for all parishioners?\n\nNot at all. Noth\u00ading in the life of the Church is forced. God gives us an oppor\u00adtu\u00adni\u00adty to do every\u00adthing accord\u00ading to our free will. Jesus Christ did not say: You have to fol\u00adlow me, but he did say, \u201cIf any\u00adone desires to come after me, let him deny him\u00adself, and take up his cross, and fol\u00adlow me\u201d (Matt. 16:24).\n\nHow is the Stewardship Commitment going to be implemented in our parish?\n\nA Stew\u00adard\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adment is based on vol\u00adun\u00adtary, pro\u00adpor\u00adtion\u00adal and reg\u00adu\u00adlar invest\u00adments of time, tal\u00adents and trea\u00adsures in the parish. It should be not\u00aded that con\u00adtribut\u00ading to your parish is not a year\u00adly com\u00admit\u00adment, but rather a life-long com\u00admit\u00adment that a Stew\u00adard makes toward their Church. Through this com\u00admit\u00adment, a parish\u00adioner shows that he is indeed a child of God, a Stew\u00adard of the God-giv\u00aden bless\u00adings which God bestows upon us dai\u00adly. Stew\u00adard\u00adship becomes an unend\u00ading grat\u00adi\u00adtude to God and serves as a sign of small thanks to Him for all the things that already belong to Him. Every\u00adthing comes from God-every\u00adthing should be returned to Him!\n\nIf my Commitment is based on a yearly giving of a set amount of money, is it possible to divide that amount over several months?\n\nAs you will see on the Stew\u00adard\u00adship Pledge Form, you may ful\u00adfill your com\u00admit\u00adment in week\u00adly, month\u00adly, or quar\u00adter\u00adly install\u00adments or in full annu\u00adal\u00adly.\n\nI have heard that some non-Orthodox denominations such as Protestants support their Church by giving 10% of their monthly\/yearly income. Do I have to do the same for my Church?\n\nThat prin\u00adci\u00adple is based on the old Hebrew cus\u00adtom of tithing or giv\u00ading \u201ctenths\u201d of all that they pos\u00adsess. How\u00adev\u00ader, not all peo\u00adple are able to put aside 10% of their month\u00adly or year\u00adly income. Con\u00adsid\u00ader the bless\u00adings that you have been pro\u00advid\u00aded and deter\u00admine the amount that you wish con\u00adtribute.\n\nIt is impor\u00adtant to remem\u00adber that God is not con\u00adcerned with \u2018how much was giv\u00aden,\u2019 but \u2018how it was giv\u00aden.\u2019 In oth\u00ader words, does a per\u00adson give out of abun\u00addance (sur\u00adplus) as the Phar\u00adisees did, or do they give all of what they have, as the poor wid\u00adow\u00ader who put the last two coins in the bas\u00adket? (Luke 21:1\u20134) As we all know, the Phar\u00adisees gave out of pride and the poor wid\u00adow\u00ader gave out of the good\u00adness of her heart and with\u00adout dis\u00adtress.\n\nWhat will happen if I am unable to fulfill my financial commitment due to job loss, sickness or any other unforeseen circumstance?\n\nNoth\u00ading will hap\u00adpen. The Church is the liv\u00ading organ\u00adism that breathes by the Holy Spir\u00adit and shel\u00adters all her chil\u00addren who seek sal\u00adva\u00adtion with\u00adin the Church. It may hap\u00adpen that a Stew\u00adard of a parish is not able to ful\u00adfill their com\u00admit\u00adment due to unfore\u00adseen cir\u00adcum\u00adstances.\n\nAm I able to complete my Stewardship Commitment form electronically and also pay electronically?\n\nYes, the Online Stew\u00adard\u00adship Pledge Form is avail\u00adable for you to fill out and sub\u00admit.\n\nFor online pay\u00adments of your Stew\u00adard\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adment, you can use your bank\u2019s bill pay fea\u00adture to make pay\u00adments direct\u00adly payable to The Nativ\u00adi\u00adty of the Most Holy Theotokos Ser\u00adbian Ortho\u00addox Parish.

If you have other questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to use our \u2018Contact\u2019 page. We would be very pleased to answer any questions you may have and maybe even add it to this list.\n\nc Expand All C Collapse All\n\nWhen studied from the Hebrew perspective, words from the Scriptures can provide a wonderful and enhanced understanding that English definitions struggle to express.\u00a0\n\nThe Old Testament (the Torah, Psalms, and Prophets) was written in Hebrew and so it is called the \u201cHoly Language.\u201d\u00a0One very important reason to study the language is that it gives insight into the Jewish mindset, which is much different from Western mindset.\u00a0 To thoroughly understand the message of Scripture it is necessary to understand the people, culture, and time in which the original text was written.\n\nMartin Luther summed it up when he wrote,\u00a0 \u201cThe Hebrew language is the best language of all\u2026if I were younger I would want to learn this language, because no one can really understand the Scriptures without it.\u00a0 Although the New Testament is written in Greek, it is full of Hebraisms and Hebrew expressions.\u00a0 It has therefore been aptly said that the Hebrews drink from the spring, the Greeks drink from the stream that flows from it, and the Latins from a downstream pool.\u201d\n\nThe Hebrew letter system is named after the first two letters the Aleph and the Bet\n\nThis probably cannot be answered with certainty.\u00a0\u00a0One popular theory proposes that early writing was chiseled in stone.\u00a0 In order to carve letters into stone the writer would most likely use his stronger hand, which was usually the right, to use the hammer that would strike the chisel held in the left hand making the mark.\u00a0 Practically speaking it would be much easier to move from right to left.\u00a0 Maybe, maybe not?\u00a0 Many archaeological finds are inscriptions that were incised into wet clay instead of chiseled in stone.\u00a0 For instance, ceramic shards or clay tablets.\n\nAncient Jewish mystics, on the other hand, generally feel that writing from right to left occurred because the right side is given precedence in Judaism.\u00a0 Why is that?\u00a0 An ancient teaching assigns the characteristic of words \u2018chesed\u2019 (loving kindness) to the right side and \u2018gevurah\u2019 (severity) to the left side.\u00a0 Kindness always comes first and begins on the right.\u00a0 For this reason a scribe would be prone to start on the right and work towards the left.\n\nAs languages and writing instruments evolved technical issues could have changed writing direction.\u00a0 It is thought that as scribes used pen and parchment it was technically easier for them to write from left to right so that ink did not smudge.\u00a0 English definitely would have been one of the languages that moved in that direction while Hebrew and other Aramaic languages were already set with right to left movement.\n\nSome would maintain that Abraham, as the Father of the Hebrews, brought the language from the original single language of the Babel story in Genesis 11. However the written form of Hebrew is not archeologically evident until Moses who was credited by New Testament citations and Jesus Himself as the author of the \u201cLaw\u201d, being the first five books of the Bible known as the Pentateuch.\n\nModern archeological finds have revealed the existence of characters of the Hebrew Aleph Bet in Paleo pictorial form as early as the first century of Israel\u2019s sojourn to Egypt.\n\nThat depends on your definition of \u2018lost or dead.\u2019 While conversational Hebrew gradually died out between 300BC and 400AD, and remained essentially unused as a spoken language for the next 1500 years, it remained continuously used as a liturgical and literary language. Spoken in ancient times, Hebrew, a member of the Canaanite branch of the Semitic language family, was supplanted as the Jewish vernacular by the western dialect of Aramaic beginning in the third century BC, after the Babylonian Captivity. The common Aramaic also died out in 1100AD, replaced by Arabic.\n\nThe revival of Hebrew as a spoken language, lead by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda in the 19th and 20th centuries, became the foundation of the official language of Israel. Modern Hebrew used Biblical Hebrew roots, Mishnaic (1st century AD spoken) spelling, and Sephardic (15th century AD Jews in Spain and Portugal) pronunciation, and included many sayings and phrase translations inherited from Yiddish (central European mixture).\n\nAccording to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the history of the Hebrew language is usually divided into four major periods:\n\n  1. Biblical (or Classical) Hebrew, until about the 3rd century BC, in which most of the Old Testament is written;\n  2. Mishnaic (or Rabbinic) Hebrew, the language of the Mishna (a collection of Jewish traditions), written about 200 AD (this form of Hebrew was never used among the people as a spoken language);\n  3. Medieval Hebrew, from about the 6th to the 13th century AD, when many words were borrowed from Greek, Spanish, Arabic, and other languages; and\n  4. Modern Hebrew, the language of Israel in modern times.\n\nThis view does not account for Hebrew in its Ancient or Paleo form which became effective as a written form circa 1450 BC and was historically used up until the time of the Babylonian Exile circa 600 BC. Upon the return of the Israelites from Babylon the language began to be written in a form of script adapted from the Babylonian experience.\n\nThe original forms of the Hebrew language had no designated vowel markings or letters. Of the several types of vowel systems devised for the Hebrew Aleph Bet the one used today was created by the Masoretes sometime after the middle of the first millennium AD.\nThere are several distinct differences between Hebrew and English:\n  1. Modern Hebrew letters developed from the ancient Paleo Hebrew letters and are visually quite different from English letters.\n  2. Hebrew letters have no upper and lower case and five of the Hebrew letters have a different form when they appear at the end of a word. On the other hand, each English letter has an upper and lower case form that does not change depending on their placement in a word.\n  3. Hebrew uses an abjad writing system which simply means there are only consonant symbols and the reader is left to supply the appropriate vowel sound.\n  4. Hebrew is read from right to left while English is left to right.\n\nWhether you learn Modern or Paleo Hebrew depends on your purpose in learning the language. If you want to carry on conversations in Hebrew, the Modern form would be best.\u00a0 A quick comparison would be to ask yourself which would you rather speak in the US today?\u00a0 Old English or Modern English?\u00a0 Same with Hebrew.\n\nBut, if your intent is to understand Scripture as the original author intended; learning the Paleo pictographic language will give you a much more functional perspective.\u00a0 You will need to acquire the mindset of an ancient Bedouin and search out how he would have understood the word from the world around him, his culture.\u00a0 It will take some work, but definitely worth the effort!\n\nThe letters or pictographs used in the Paleo or Ancient Hebrew are much easier to learn and associate with their meaning than Modern Hebrew. For example, the Aleph is a drawing of the head of an ox and means strong, first, or leader. The 22 Paleo letters and their meanings can easily be learned in just an hour or two. This creates a better initial atmosphere for learning how words were used in the Bible.\nThe terms \u2018Ancient\u2019 and \u2018Paleo\u2019 Hebrew are used interchangeably.\nAlthough both are abjad scripts (no vowel letters), their appearance became quite different about 800-500 BC. Since the era of the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities, the form of the Hebrew letters has been completely different \u2014 changing from Proto Canaanite pictographs to an Aramaic shaped alphabet. Although the Modern letters do retain individual meanings, they are rarely used to define words.\nPaleo Hebrew was the earliest form of the Hebrew language with known inscriptions dating 1450BC. In 587 BC, under the rule of King Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonians captured several thousand of the educated and wealthy in Jerusalem and carried them off to exile. Over the years of captivity many of the Israelites blended in and were assimilated into the society having a profound effect on their way of life and beliefs. Ezra, the scribe, was born in Babylon and one of the first to return to Jerusalem. The lettering he brought back was highly influenced by the Aramaic letters he had learned and began the transformation of the ancient Hebrew Aleph Bet into the modern Hebrew letters.\nDuring and after the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BC, most of the Hebrew writings started using Aramaic lettering and became, over time, very similar to the Arabic style.\n\nThe earliest Paleo Hebrew inscriptions dated about 1450BC. Until recently it was assumed that the Hebrews had acquired the knowledge of an Aleph Bert from Phoenician alphabet carvings. However, modern archeology has provided evidence that the Hebrews in Egypt devised the world\u2019s first Aleph Bet and carried that knowledge to Canaan on their sojourn. Over the next several hundred years, regional characteristics began to separate the script into different national alphabets (all within 100-200 miles), including Israelite, Samaritan, Moabite, Edomite, Phoenician, and Old Aramaic. Even within those smaller regions, the script also changed due to the writing medium changes, i.e. chiseled stone, clay, papyrus, etc.\n\nThe explanations and products on our website occasionally use some of the regional variants that help demonstrate the functional meanings of the words depicted.\n\nWe think the Paleo is initially much simpler because it is easier to associate the pictorial letters with their meaning. Writing and understanding a few hundred Paleo words is rather intuitive and gives a great foundation for the language. Once you get beyond that initial study, co... (truncated)",

They do not come from a Star System or Star Cluster within our Density or \"Reality\". These beings come from the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th Density Realm that is not through a stargate, dimensional rift or out of phase star system. Their \"Reality\" or Density\/Realm is on another plane of existence than our own. From what I have been told what has been referred to as \"The Central Race\" is a 4th\/5th Density group that is much closer to our 3rd\/4th Density \"Reality\" and they still depend on Technology. The Sphere Beings are apart of a \"Confederation of Higher Density Beings\" who are being of Service to Others and assisting lower vibrational\/density beings in their \"Transitions\" to the higher vibrations\/densities. I have received all kinds of emails stating they are the \"Velon\", \"Annunaki\" and \"Reptilians\" that are \"Masquerading as Angels\" or are known 4th\/5th D Groups that are traveling here from the Central part of our Galaxy on behest of the \"13\" to assist \"US\" in breaking free from the \"Custodian Gods\/Aliens\" who have ruled and manipulated our existence for melinea... I want to be very clear and go on record that the Sphere Beings have communicated to me that this is not the case and they are not only not affiliated with these other groups mentioned but have \"Refused All Communication Attempts\" from these groups as well as \"Various Human Groups\".

Hopefully.\n\n    02 Apr 2015\n  \u2022 One \"Source\" says the Sphere Being Alliance is a part of the \"Andromeda Council\" & their spheres make up part of the \"Sphere Alliance\". That the \"Blue Avians\" are Annunaki (\"Annuans\") from the planet \"Nibiru\". How can this be if they are 6th Density?\n\n    This is the second question in a row on this subject.\n\n    This \"Source\" is mistaken,\n\n    The group they mention is not related to the Sphere Alliance nor would they be from the same Density. These spheres are not physical craft as this source describes. I do not know how to make this more clear.\n\n    The \"Andromeda Council\" is not apart of the \"Sphere Alliance\" which is a group of 5 6th - 9th Density beings. They are not here to evacuate the planet in Spheres nor are there here to save us, or directly interfere in our affairs.\n\n    They also stated that the Blue Avians were \"Cousins\" of the Anunnaki and were from Nibiru.

What ruling does touching this tissue have?\n\nAnswer: It is spiritually unclean if it is called a piece of a body and has been cut off, but one does not have to perform a ghusl due to touching it.\n\nQuestion five: Suppose one\u2019s mouth becomes bloody and his artificial teeth touch the blood. Can one make the artificial teeth spiritually clean without taking them out of the mouth?\n\nAnswer: It is possible, it is even possible with less than kur water.\n\nQuestion six: What ruling does swallowing blood that comes from one\u2019s gums due to a sickness or due to brushing one\u2019s teeth have?\n\nAnswer: If one has a choice it is not permissible.\n\nQuestion seven: What ruling does thin transparent blood have after it is made spiritually clean and the blood is cleaned off of the wound have?\n\nAnswer: It is spiritually unclean if there is blood in it.\n\nQuestion eight: What ruling does transferring blood from a woman to a man or from an unbeliever to a Muslim have?\n\nAnswer: There is no problem in it.\n\nQuestion nine: What ruling does touching the blood of a mosquito or a fish whose blood does not gush out of its veins have?\n\nAnswer: There is no problem, it does not cause spiritual uncleanliness.\n\nQuestion ten: Sometimes when one wants to draw blood he puts a needle into the vein and the needle comes into contact with blood. But, because the blood did not flow into the needle or an insufficient amount of blood was taken there is a need to take more blood. Does this needle become spiritually unclean?

With this work you can do healing for yourself and others, affecting both the physical and emotional levels. \u00a0You will also improve your ability to perceive energy and will find your life affected on many levels. The techniques are quite simple to learn and are incredibly far reaching in effect.\n\nWhat makes The Wonder Method\u2122 different from other classes in energy work that I have taken?\n\nThe Wonder Method\u2122 operates on a number of different levels in your system and also changes the way you operate in the world. Its major focus initially is to unwind the feelings\/emotions that are limiting your life. \u00a0This is so far reaching that it is very difficult to describe, but as you unwind you will find yourself changing in how you relate to others, and even in how you experience your world. \u00a0It is a very experiential process. \u00a0By this, we mean you physically feel the differences in both how you feel and how you approach life. \u00a0The nuances are subtle, yet profound. \u00a0The statement from the Tao te Ching \u201cLess and less do you need to force things until you arrive at non-action, when nothing is done, nothing is left undone\u201d begins to have deep significance.\n\nDo I have to practice regularly to have this method work?\n\nYes, life is an on-going process and as such things happen throughout your day that would benefit from applying The Wonder Method\u2122. The process often takes less than a minute to do, when applied properly.\n\nI notice that your classes are limited to a comparatively small group of students, why is that?\n\nUnlike many of the classes out there that try to pack as many into the room as possible while you see what you can get from the lectures; our goal is to make sure that people really understand how to do our work. \u00a0As each exercise is explained not only do we answer questions, we actually have you demonstrate the technique to us. \u00a0When you do this, we sense how the energy in your system is affected by the exercises and show you how to refine your ability till you \u201cget it\u201d. \u00a0We are interested in offering you high quality, repeatable experiences. \u00a0Our job is to empower you. \u00a0We desire to help you become everything you can with the teachings we are offering. \u00a0To this end we do everything we can to help you understand the work.\n\nHow are you able to coach someone without seeing them?\n\nWith energy there is no distance. \u00a0What can be sensed about a person when they are present, can be sensed just as easily long distance. \u00a0We have been coaching people in this way both in private sessions and in group sessions for more than ten years.\n\nWhat are the different things you can do with The Wonder Method\u2122?\n\nWhat you can apply this work to is really unlimited. \u00a0As feelings are the basic stuff underlying how you approach any problem or situation, they have deep significance to every aspect of your life. \u00a0As these issues unwind you will change how you do things because you are operating from a very centered place.\n\nThis applies to:\n\n  \u2022 How you run your business\n  \u2022 How you interact in your relationships, both personal and professional\n  \u2022 How you create your reality\n  \u2022 Having the ability to experience expanded levels of consciousness that are repeatable and sustainable\n  \u2022 How healthy you are\n  \u2022 How fast you heal\n  \u2022 This list is truly endless\n\nThis all sounds very Zen, do I need to meditate or hold special beliefs?\n\nNo, you apply this work at need. \u00a0In other words, when something happens to push your buttons, you apply the process. \u00a0As you apply the model, any belief or feeling that appears to limit you is what gives you the opportunity to grow, it is your access point.\n\nWhat about doing energy healing work, how does that fit into The Wonder Method\u2122?\n\nThe healing aspect of this work is very simple; feeling is the entry point to it all. \u00a0Using The Wonder Method\u2122 opens both you and the clients you work with. This in turn leads to deep change at every level for a client, encompassing their physical, emotional and spiritual levels.\n\nHow does this work compare to the Quantum-Touch Core Transformation work you used to teach?\n\nWhile there are some similarities to the Core work, The Wonder Method\u2122 simplifies the healing process and increases the state of being present. It is also applicable to every aspect of your life, not energy work alone. \u00a0In addition The Wonder Method\u2122 goes deeply into the emotions that are holding us locked, as this is an integral part of The Wonder Method\u2122 work.\n\nDo I need to figure out where the emotions come from?\n\nNo, in this work we actually prefer that you don\u2019t do that. \u00a0Every moment of every day you will supply everything that you need to work with. Again, it is simple and leads to a deeply relaxing empowering state of being. It puts you back into the driver\u2019s seat in your life. \u00a0It does require effort, and you must be willing to feel.\n\nI already know how to feel, what is different about what you are doing?\n\nThis is very different than what you are used to. It is not about the drama in life that is causing the feelings, it is both simpler and more complex than that. We can say that once you try it you will be amazed how wonderful it feels and how it changes your life.\n\nI have always been interested in altered states and connecting to my higher self, does this work have anything to do with that?\n\nYes, the states that The Wonder Method\u2122 allows you to enter are deeply moving. \u00a0The idea of the higher self and states like Kundalini energies unfold naturally from the work. \u00a0Often in the time that it takes to do the course you will find you can get to places you had only imagined before.\n\nWhat about becoming enlightened (that has been one of my lifelong desires)?\n\nMany people have different views of what this means. \u00a0As you apply The Wonder Method\u2122, you will find that in a matter of weeks, sometimes months, when properly applied, you have a sense, (a knowingness if you will) that you simply are. \u00a0The striving dissipates, the need to achieve or be better than someone or something, changes. \u00a0By simply being, you will find that while you now understand that you could do anything you desire, you don\u2019t have to do it. \u00a0Life becomes an opportunity versus a striving. \u00a0You are no longer driven by the fears that used to motivate you to try and try; life simply unfolds. \u00a0You are now motivated by what would bring you balance and joy; your world will bit by bit reflect this balance. \u00a0This is one of the definitions of enlightenment.\n\nWhy does The Wonder Method\u2122 work so fast?\n\nBecause we do not try to push or change things, there is less resistance created and therefore things unfold more easily. \u00a0This is a very Yin or soft concept.\n\nThought for the Week\n\n\nOur feelings may seem overwhelming yet if we allow ourselves to experience them even the tiniest bit we begin the path to change and balance.\u00a0 For every grain of sand you move (every feeling you feel) a mountain of feeling is in motion\\.\u00a0 Let yourself evolve, such is the nature of feeling.\n\nRead More\nFeatured Video\n\n\ne-motion documentary trailer\nCommunity Forum\n\n\nExplore our Community Forum where you'll find information about The Wonder Method\u2122, Certification and more.\n\nVisit the Community Forum\n\ncurved line graphic",

        "text":"Home > Ketubah FAQ's > What is a Ketubah?\n\nWhat\u2019s a ketubah?\n\nOriginally a ketubah (\u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 in Hebrew) was a prenuptial agreement in the Jewish faith.\u00a0 Now a days, a ketubah is \u00a0a marriage certificate that \u00a0articulates the couple\u2019s love, commitment, and plans for the future. \u00a0It\u2019s kind of like marriage vows expressed through both words and visual art.\u00a0 \u00a0A ketubah is not only a lovely custom and a beautiful tradition, but it can also be a source of inspiration for\u00a0 a long and successful marriage.\u00a0 My husband likes to say that our marital contract is something we renew every morning.\n\nAlthough a ketubah is still a very important part of Jewish wedding tradition, it is a beautiful custom and has become popular in all different faiths and cultures. \u00a0Even Prince William and Princess Kate got a ketubah!\n\n\u201cKetubah\u201d can also be spelled katuba, ketuba, katubah, katubbah, ketubba and many other ways! Because it is a translation of Hebrew (\u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4) so there is really no right or wrong, but \u201cketubah\u201d is the most common spelling in English.\u00a0 The proper way to say \u201cketubah\u201d in plural is \u201cketubot\u201d, but since most people don\u2019t know that, on our site we go with the English version: \u201cketubahs.\u201d\n\n\nWhat should a ketubah look like?\n\nYour ketubah \u00a0art is a visual expression of your love, and therefore should look beautiful to both of you. Your ketubah will stay with you for the rest of your life together, so make sure to pick art that you really love and will be proud to display in your home. \u00a0\u00a0There is really no set standard for how your ketubah should look or what the artwork should portray.\u00a0 I come from a background of fine art and contemporary figurative painting, so many of my ketubahs retain modern figurative qualities, but fuse them (sometimes literally!) with symbols for life, love, strength and home (such as trees and nature!) as well as elements of traditional Judaica.\n\nWhat should the ketubah text say?\n\nThere are many different approaches to ketubah text. Sometimes your rabbi will have a specific text that he wants you to use. Sometimes a couple prefers to write their own text, one which they feel best expresses their unique love story and relationship.\u00a0 We offer a variety of texts including Reform, Egalitarian, Interfaith,\u00a0 Same Sex, Conservative, Traditional and Orthodox.\u00a0 All of our texts can come in either English or Hebrew\/Aramaic or both and all of my ketubah designs can also be created with any text of your choice. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nphoto by Wes Craft Photography\n\nHow did you get started creating art for weddings?\n\nI have been drawing and painting my entire life. I studied fine art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where my focus was in figurative and portrait art.\u00a0 After college I moved to New York and later to Jerusalem, Israel. It was in Israel that I fell in love with the colors, imagery and symbolism of the Middle East. My art started to reflect this new aesthetic.\u00a0 When my husband and I were planning our wedding, I painted our ketubah. It was such a wonderful process because I felt that both creating the artwork and choosing \u00a0the text for our ketubah was an opportunity to channel all our feelings of love and excitement into this one piece of art. \u00a0After our wedding, other people started asking me to create their ketubahs\u2026 and the rest is history!\u00a0 I feel that in specializing in ketubah art, I have really found an amazing outlet that allows me not only to be creative and paint all day, but also to meet so many wonderful people at such an exciting time in their lives. It\u2019s an honor to be a part of their journeys.",

        "text":"Does the thought of death and thus the state of non-existence frighten atheists?\n\nReligions play on death and escaping from it as a consistent theme. Promoting this on a continuing basis produces an unhealthy attitude to mortality. On the other hand, atheists soon accept that death is a reality of life and therefore spend little time pondering it.\n\nMost atheists find that death is a regrettable but natural part of living and have no choice but to accept the reality. No-one wishes to experience the final parting of family and friends but wishing for a better outcome of everlasting life will not make it so no matter how intense is that desire.",

        "text":"Cutting all of the moustache\n\nQ: It is reported in many Hadiths Trim closely the mustache, and let the beard grow. Also, there are reports for clipping fingernails, plucking hair under the armpits, and shaving pubic hair. Is there any difference between shaving and trimming? Some people only trim the lower half of the mustache, is this the trimming meant in such reports or should the whole mustache be shaved? Please inform me of the manner that should be followed regarding shaving the mustache. As for letting the beard grow, this is well established and it means that it should be left completely.\n\nA: All Praise is due to Allah Alone and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, his family and Companions. Authentic Hadiths narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) signify the validity of trimming the mustache, clipping nails, plucking the hair under the armpits, and shaving pubic hair. Some of these Hadith are: Trim closely the moustache, and let the beard grow to be unlike the disbelievers. Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: Trim closely the moustache, and grow the beard, and be unlike the fire-worshippers. According to some narrations: Trim closely the moustache. Since trimming stands for excessive cutting, a person may either clip the mustache closely until the upper lip appears or trim it because the Hadith permitted both. However, letting the two edges of the mustache grow (Part No. 5; Page No. 132)\u00a0is not permitted. The Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) on this is either to clip the mustache completely or trim it completely.May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.",

All the activities that we do constitute karma.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita defines three types of karmavikarma, karma and akarma.\n\nVikarma is those activities that the scriptures ask not to be done and karma is those activities that scriptures prescribe. In both cases we get the reaction to our sinful or pious activities for which we have to be born in this material world again and again to suffer or enjoy. So in the ultimate sense both activities are bad because they do not help in getting liberated from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nAkarma is those activities that are done only with the purpose of pleasing Krishna or in other words devotional service to Krishna which does not entail any karmic reaction and so helps us attain an eternal life of service to Krishna in bliss.",

        "text":"Bible Truth FAQs\n\n\nSince all have sinned (Rom. 3:23), forgiveness is an extremely important Bible subject. Everyone should want to understand it fully. Some have been heard to say, \"I'11 forgive but I won't forget.\" The human memory does not purposely erase an occurrence, but future use of such in a disc1pl1nary manner is strong evidence there never was forgiveness. Div1ne forgiveness does not recall sins that have been forgiven (Heb. 8:12).\n\nUnder Mosaic Law certain offenses were punishable by death. How fortunate that we now live under the system of grace which offers forgiveness every time an offender genuinely repents and asks to be forgiven (See Matt. 18:21-22).\n\nThe laws of pardon apply to two different circumstances. To a person who is not already in God's family (the church), the terms are, \"Repent and be baptized in the name of Christ for the remission (forgiveness) of sin\" (Acts 2:38). To the .child of God (Christian ) it is to repent, confess, and pray (James 5:16). It is necessary to use the appropriate access to the heavenly throne.\n\n\u00a0[ Home Page ]\u00a0 [ FAQ Index ]",

(note:side boxes have local - RR info and church - and web links)\n\nChristian Science is not faith healing\nChristian Science does not involve pleading with God to heal the sick and then accepting His will, good or bad. Nothing in Christian Science theology says it\u2019s God\u2019s will that anyone suffer, be sick, or die. Christian Science shows God to be entirely good, and therefore His will for each individual is only health and life.\n\nIt\u2019s not positive thinking which relies on the human mind to think or effect a good result.\nChristian Science starts with God, who is divine Mind, and the conviction that God\u2019s goodness embraces each of us, all the time.\n\nAnd not a cult. There is no brainwashing, mind control, or blind following of a leader.\nChristian Scientists do have a deep respect and appreciation for the Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science, Mary Baker Eddy, but they do not worship her.\n\nChristian Science is very different from Scientology.\nThrough her search of the Scriptures, Mary Baker Eddy discovered the Christ Science. It is based on the teachings of Christ Jesus. Christian Scientists believe in one all-powerful, ever-present, loving God. They study the Bible daily and look to its inspired Word for guidance in every aspect of their lives.\n\nIt\u2019s based upon a set of spiritual principles\u2014laws relating to the nature of God and His creation\u2014that can be applied with expected, consistent results. Christian Science is based on the Bible, and Christian Scientists follow the teachings and ministry of Christ Jesus. The virgin birth, the crucifixion, the resurrection and ascension of Christ Jesus, and the healing work of Jesus, are all central to Christian Science theology.\n\nThere is no church mandate, no biblical mandate to forgo medical intervention, nor do Christian Scientists believe that it\u2019s God\u2019s will that anyone suffer or die. A Christian Scientist\u2019s decision to rely on prayer comes from trust, not blind faith, in God, and from a conviction that God\u2019s care continues under every circumstance.\n\nNo medicine for yourself \u2013 what about your children?\nChristian Science parents are like any other parents\u2014they love their children and want the very best care for them. They also recognize their moral and legal obligation to ensure that their children receive this care. Parents who choose Christian Science treatment for a child do so because they\u2019ve seen the effectiveness of this treatment in their own lives.\n\nWhat would you do if you broke your leg?\nMany Christian Scientists would tell you that they would naturally turn to God for healing because they\u2019d seen the effectiveness of this approach in the past.\n\nThis, however, does not prevent them from having a bone set if they so choose. The Christian Science Journal, Christian Science Sentinel, and The Herald of Christian Science also contain documented healings of broken bones.\n\nHow can you claim \u201cthousands of healings\u201d when in most cases there\u2019s no medical diagnosis?\nThere have been many Christian Science healings of conditions that have been medically diagnosed, and many medical confirmations of those healings. However, one does not need a medical diagnosis to know a person was ill and then healthy.\n\nWhat do you do in the case of communicable disease?\nChristian Scientists care about their neighbors and abide by city and state laws or mandates regarding quarantines, vaccinations, and the like. The Christian Science Journal, Christian Science Sentinel, and The Herald of Christian Science (found in Christian Science Reading Rooms) contain many documented healings of communicable diseases and show the role prayer can play, not just in protecting and healing individuals, but in helping communities as well.\n\nDo you lobby for exemptions to health laws?\nChristian Scientists seek accommodations in laws to ensure that healthcare choices include the system of spiritual prayer that they have found to be effective.\n\nDo Christian Scientists carry health insurance or life insurance?\nSome have health insurance, and most probably have life insurance. Every Christian Scientist makes his or her own financial and health decisions.\n\nChristian Science practitioners\nare self-employed individuals, who have completed a course in spiritual healing given by an authorized teacher of Christian Science, and who devote themselves full time to helping and healing others through prayer. While practitioners do not offer counseling, diagnosis, prognosis, or any physical manipulation or treatment, they do offer Christian Science treatment\u2014as explained in Eddy\u2019s book, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.\n\nChristian Science treatment is the application of spiritual principles\u2014who and what God is and what that means for each individual\u2014to the specifics of any given situation. These spiritual principles, applied, have a tangible effect\u2014restored relationships, financial well-being, physical healing, and so on.\n\nChristian Science Nurses and Care Facilities are also available when assistance or care is needed for an individual relying on Christian Science treatment.\n\nThe heart of Christian Science is Love. It is about feeling God\u2019s goodness. It is based on the Bible and is explained in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures and other writings by Mary Baker Eddy.\n\nIt addresses major points about God, good and evil, life and death, sacrament, salvation and more. There is much more information at including videos of how people live the teachings of Christian Science.\n\n\nThe desire of every Christian Scientist is to see the suffering in the world alleviated, and Christian Scientists take encouragement from Jesus\u2019 example in healing even the most extreme suffering. He overcame poverty, hunger, severe weather, even incurable mental and physical maladies\u2014and he promised his followers they could do the same.\n\nThe Church\u2019s does not take an official position on abortion, cloning, and other \u201chot-button issues\u201d. These are all serious issues, and they deserve everyone\u2019s deep thought and prayer\u2014including Christian Scientists\u2019.\n\nDo you pay any attention to problems like poverty, racism, genocide, famine, etc?\nThese are certainly problems that need addressing, and this is the reason Mary Baker Eddy founded the newspaper The Christian Science Monitor\u2014to alert the world to these problems and to invite solutions. Many Christian Scientists find their prayers regarding these issues lead them to take practical steps.\n\nThe Christian Science Journal, Christian Science Sentinel, and The Herald of Christian Science, along with Churches of Christ, Scientist, regularly offer healing responses to these problems as well as ideas to help each individual address them through prayer. These publications are all available in the Christian Science Reading Room \u2013current issues, a 120 plus year library of archived issues, and a searchable electronic library.\n\nStill have questions?
