What ruling does touching this tissue have?\n\nAnswer: It is spiritually unclean if it is called a piece of a body and has been cut off, but one does not have to perform a ghusl due to touching it.\n\nQuestion five: Suppose one\u2019s mouth becomes bloody and his artificial teeth touch the blood. Can one make the artificial teeth spiritually clean without taking them out of the mouth?\n\nAnswer: It is possible, it is even possible with less than kur water.\n\nQuestion six: What ruling does swallowing blood that comes from one\u2019s gums due to a sickness or due to brushing one\u2019s teeth have?\n\nAnswer: If one has a choice it is not permissible.\n\nQuestion seven: What ruling does thin transparent blood have after it is made spiritually clean and the blood is cleaned off of the wound have?\n\nAnswer: It is spiritually unclean if there is blood in it.\n\nQuestion eight: What ruling does transferring blood from a woman to a man or from an unbeliever to a Muslim have?\n\nAnswer: There is no problem in it.\n\nQuestion nine: What ruling does touching the blood of a mosquito or a fish whose blood does not gush out of its veins have?\n\nAnswer: There is no problem, it does not cause spiritual uncleanliness.\n\nQuestion ten: Sometimes when one wants to draw blood he puts a needle into the vein and the needle comes into contact with blood. But, because the blood did not flow into the needle or an insufficient amount of blood was taken there is a need to take more blood. Does this needle become spiritually unclean? Is one able to use this needle again?\n\nAnswer: There is no problem in using it again and it is spiritually clean if there is no blood on the outside of the needle and the needle did not touch a wet spiritually unclean substance.\n\nQuestion eleven: What ruling does touching the sweat of a junub person or spiritually unclean items have?\n\nAnswer: The sweat of a junub person is not spiritually unclean. If one touches a spiritually unclean substance that is wet enough to transfer the wetness he (the part that touched) will become spiritually unclean.\n\nQuestion twelve: Sometimes blood reaches the hands of a person taking another person\u2019s blood. Is it possible to make his hand spiritually clean by using a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol or does one have to act according to the rules found in the books of jurisprudence?\n\nAnswer: Making items that have become spiritually unclean spiritually clean, similar to what has been mentioned in the question, must be done by using water.\n\nQuestion thirteen: Sometimes a broken bone tears through the skin, does touching this bone necessitate a ghusl?\n\nAnswer: Ghusl is not necessitated if the person is still alive. If the person is dead, then, in all cases, if it is touched a ghusl will become obligatory.\n\nQuestion fourteen: Sometimes people knowingly or unknowingly tear some of their skin around their fingernail, or any other place, off. Does touching a part of the skin that has been separated necessitate a ghusl?\n\nAnswer: It does not necessitate a ghusl.\n\nQuestion fifteen: Does semen that comes out without lust, unintentionally, and without force necessitate a ghusl?\n\nAnswer: A ghusl is necessitated if one is certain that it was semen.\n\nQuestion sixteen: How does one perform ghusl if his whole leg or arm is in a cast?\n\nAnswer: He must perform the jab\u012brah ghusl.\n\nShare this page",

Becom\u00ading a Stew\u00adard begins when we say we believe in God, to whom we give our love, loy\u00adal\u00adty and trust. We affirm that every aspect of our lives comes as a gift from Him. Stew\u00adards are moti\u00advat\u00aded as recip\u00adi\u00adents of God\u2019s abun\u00addant love, to respond by par\u00adtic\u00adi\u00adpat\u00ading and sup\u00adport\u00ading His plan of sal\u00adva\u00adtion and the min\u00adistries of the Church, which make sal\u00adva\u00adtion pos\u00adsi\u00adble for them and for oth\u00aders.\n\nIn the Bible, the Stew\u00adard is depict\u00aded as a per\u00adson who is giv\u00aden the respon\u00adsi\u00adbil\u00adi\u00adty of man\u00adag\u00ading some\u00adthing that belongs to the Own\u00ader, God. The Stew\u00adard as the man\u00adag\u00ader is thus account\u00adable to the Own\u00ader for all that he pos\u00adsess\u00ades and is respon\u00adsi\u00adble to return to the Lord his or her fair share in grat\u00adi\u00adtude and thanks\u00adgiv\u00ading. As God has been gen\u00ader\u00adous to us, He expects us to be gen\u00ader\u00adous toward the work of Christ and His Church. Chris\u00adt\u00adian Stew\u00adard\u00adship is the priv\u00adi\u00adlege and hon\u00ador of direct\u00adly sup\u00adport\u00ading God\u2019s work on earth through the Church.\n\nWhat is a Stewardship Commitment?\n\nA Stew\u00adard\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adment is a method by which every parish\u00adioner can active\u00adly par\u00adtic\u00adi\u00adpate in the sup\u00adport of the parish accord\u00ading to his\/her abil\u00adi\u00adties. The finan\u00adcial sup\u00adport of the parish falls into the hands of every parish\u00adioner (Stew\u00adard) who by his\/her con\u00adscience con\u00adtin\u00adu\u00adal\u00adly invests their time, tal\u00adents, and trea\u00adsures in the life of the parish.\n\nWhy is Stewardship Commitment necessary in our parish?\n\nMak\u00ading a Stew\u00adard\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adment by com\u00adplet\u00ading a Stew\u00adard\u00adship Pledge Form helps the parish cre\u00adate a bud\u00adget and man\u00adage our finances more eas\u00adi\u00adly and effec\u00adtive\u00adly, Addi\u00adtion\u00adal\u00adly, it will assist us in cre\u00adat\u00ading a data\u00adbase of vol\u00adun\u00adteers who com\u00admit to their Ortho\u00addox Stew\u00adard\u00adship through Time and Tal\u00adents. And for the parish\u00adioner, it\u2019s a mean\u00ading\u00adful expres\u00adsion of sup\u00adport for your Parish.\n\nHow is the church currently supported financially?\n\nOur Church is sup\u00adport\u00aded pri\u00admar\u00adi\u00adly through con\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtions from of our parish\u00adioners and rev\u00adenues from Church spon\u00adsored events (e.g.,The Gala, Food Fest, etc.). In recent years the Church has had to make cash with\u00addrawals from our sav\u00adings to meet expens\u00ades. While we still have cash reserves in our account, we can\u00adnot con\u00adtin\u00adue to rely on our sav\u00adings to pay for expens\u00ades. We are reach\u00ading out to encour\u00adage more of our Parish\u00adioners to become active Stew\u00adards in our Church.\n\nIs the Stewardship Commitment mandatory for all parishioners?\n\nNot at all. Noth\u00ading in the life of the Church is forced. God gives us an oppor\u00adtu\u00adni\u00adty to do every\u00adthing accord\u00ading to our free will. Jesus Christ did not say: You have to fol\u00adlow me, but he did say, \u201cIf any\u00adone desires to come after me, let him deny him\u00adself, and take up his cross, and fol\u00adlow me\u201d (Matt. 16:24).\n\nHow is the Stewardship Commitment going to be implemented in our parish?\n\nA Stew\u00adard\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adment is based on vol\u00adun\u00adtary, pro\u00adpor\u00adtion\u00adal and reg\u00adu\u00adlar invest\u00adments of time, tal\u00adents and trea\u00adsures in the parish. It should be not\u00aded that con\u00adtribut\u00ading to your parish is not a year\u00adly com\u00admit\u00adment, but rather a life-long com\u00admit\u00adment that a Stew\u00adard makes toward their Church. Through this com\u00admit\u00adment, a parish\u00adioner shows that he is indeed a child of God, a Stew\u00adard of the God-giv\u00aden bless\u00adings which God bestows upon us dai\u00adly. Stew\u00adard\u00adship becomes an unend\u00ading grat\u00adi\u00adtude to God and serves as a sign of small thanks to Him for all the things that already belong to Him. Every\u00adthing comes from God-every\u00adthing should be returned to Him!\n\nIf my Commitment is based on a yearly giving of a set amount of money, is it possible to divide that amount over several months?\n\nAs you will see on the Stew\u00adard\u00adship Pledge Form, you may ful\u00adfill your com\u00admit\u00adment in week\u00adly, month\u00adly, or quar\u00adter\u00adly install\u00adments or in full annu\u00adal\u00adly.\n\nI have heard that some non-Orthodox denominations such as Protestants support their Church by giving 10% of their monthly\/yearly income. Do I have to do the same for my Church?\n\nThat prin\u00adci\u00adple is based on the old Hebrew cus\u00adtom of tithing or giv\u00ading \u201ctenths\u201d of all that they pos\u00adsess. How\u00adev\u00ader, not all peo\u00adple are able to put aside 10% of their month\u00adly or year\u00adly income. Con\u00adsid\u00ader the bless\u00adings that you have been pro\u00advid\u00aded and deter\u00admine the amount that you wish con\u00adtribute.\n\nIt is impor\u00adtant to remem\u00adber that God is not con\u00adcerned with \u2018how much was giv\u00aden,\u2019 but \u2018how it was giv\u00aden.\u2019 In oth\u00ader words, does a per\u00adson give out of abun\u00addance (sur\u00adplus) as the Phar\u00adisees did, or do they give all of what they have, as the poor wid\u00adow\u00ader who put the last two coins in the bas\u00adket? (Luke 21:1\u20134) As we all know, the Phar\u00adisees gave out of pride and the poor wid\u00adow\u00ader gave out of the good\u00adness of her heart and with\u00adout dis\u00adtress.\n\nWhat will happen if I am unable to fulfill my financial commitment due to job loss, sickness or any other unforeseen circumstance?\n\nNoth\u00ading will hap\u00adpen. The Church is the liv\u00ading organ\u00adism that breathes by the Holy Spir\u00adit and shel\u00adters all her chil\u00addren who seek sal\u00adva\u00adtion with\u00adin the Church. It may hap\u00adpen that a Stew\u00adard of a parish is not able to ful\u00adfill their com\u00admit\u00adment due to unfore\u00adseen cir\u00adcum\u00adstances.\n\nAm I able to complete my Stewardship Commitment form electronically and also pay electronically?\n\nYes, the Online Stew\u00adard\u00adship Pledge Form is avail\u00adable for you to fill out and sub\u00admit.\n\nFor online pay\u00adments of your Stew\u00adard\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adment, you can use your bank\u2019s bill pay fea\u00adture to make pay\u00adments direct\u00adly payable to The Nativ\u00adi\u00adty of the Most Holy Theotokos Ser\u00adbian Ortho\u00addox Parish. Please make sure to include the church\u2019s address when set\u00adting up your bill pay on your bank\u00ading web\u00adsite. Addi\u00adtion\u00adal\u00adly, you can make elec\u00adtron\u00adic pay\u00adments by cred\u00adit card or bank trans\u00adfer via Pay\u00adPal. Vis\u00adit our Dona\u00adtions page to make your dona\u00adtion with Pay\u00adpal.\n\nWhat if I do not have access to the internet or online banking, how can I submit my commitment form and payments?\n\nStew\u00adard\u00adship Pledge Forms and envelopes are avail\u00adable on the can\u00addle stand in the narthex of our Church.\n\nYou can mail your com\u00adplet\u00aded com\u00admit\u00adment forms and pay\u00adments to the church office:\nThe Nativ\u00adi\u00adty of the Most Holy Theotokos Ser\u00adbian Ortho\u00addox Parish\n2148 Michel\u00adson Dr.\nIrvine, CA 92612\n\nOr, you can bring them to Church on Sun\u00addays when you come for Divine Litur\u00adgy.\n\nPlease be sure to make your checks or mon\u00adey orders made payable to The Nativ\u00adi\u00adty of the Most Holy Theotokos Ser\u00adbian Ortho\u00addox Parish. DO NOT SEND CASH!\n\nWho is included in my Stewardship Commitment?\n\nThe Stew\u00adard\u00adship Com\u00admit\u00adment includes: hus\u00adband, wife and chil\u00addren under the age of 18.\n\nHow can I decide how much to give to the Church?\n\nThis is a per\u00adson\u00adal deci\u00adsion between you and God.\n\nWe plan to pub\u00adlish the names of per\u00adsons who sub\u00admit a Stew\u00adard\u00adship Pledge Form but not the amounts. This approach elim\u00adi\u00adnates pride\u00adful (Phar\u00adi\u00adsa\u00adic) giv\u00ading, com\u00adpet\u00adi\u00adtive giv\u00ading, and alle\u00advi\u00adates a dis\u00adcom\u00adfort for those who are not able to give a large sum.\n\nThe finan\u00adcial com\u00admit\u00adment that you arrive at should evolve from your per\u00adson\u00adal judg\u00adment based upon your finan\u00adcial resources com\u00adbined with a spir\u00adi\u00adtu\u00adal expres\u00adsion of the grat\u00adi\u00adtude and love for the bless\u00adings which have been pro\u00advid\u00aded to you by our Lord.\n\nStew\u00adard\u00adship is about equal sac\u00adri\u00adfice, not equal giv\u00ading.\n\nWhat does the Bible say about financial support of the Church?\n\nWe will cite a few pas\u00adsages from the Bible that clear\u00adly state how we should sup\u00adport our Church:\n\nSecret\u00adly: \u201cThat your char\u00adi\u00adta\u00adble deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret, will Him\u00adself reward you open\u00adly.\u201d Matt. 6:4\n\nReg\u00adu\u00adlar\u00adly: \u201cOn the first day of the week let each one of you lay some\u00adthing aside, stor\u00ading up as he may pros\u00adper\u2026\u201d 1 Cor. 16:2\n\nBoun\u00adti\u00adful\u00adly and Will\u00ading\u00adly: \u201cHe who spar\u00ading\u00adly sows will also spar\u00ading\u00adly reap, and he who sows boun\u00adti\u00adful\u00adly will also reap boun\u00adti\u00adful\u00adly. So let each one give as he pur\u00adpos\u00ades in his heart, not grudg\u00ading\u00adly or of neces\u00adsi\u00adty; for God loves a cheer\u00adful giv\u00ader.\u201d 2 Cor. 9:6\u20137\n\nAs Sacrifice\/Offering: \u201cAlso we made ordi\u00adnances for our\u00adselves, to exact from our\u00adselves year\u00adly one-third of a shekel for the ser\u00advice of the house of our God.\u201d Nehemi\u00adah 10:32\n\nFor the Heav\u00aden\u00adly Reward: \u201cDo not lay up for your\u00adselves trea\u00adsures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal. But lay up for your\u00adselves trea\u00adsures in heav\u00aden, where nei\u00adther moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break and steal. For where your trea\u00adsure is, there your heart will be also.\u201d Matt. 6:19\u201321\n\nBeing aware greed: \u201cFor the love of mon\u00adey is a root of all kinds of evil\u2026\u201d 1 Tim\u00ado\u00adthy 6:10",

        "text":"Cutting all of the moustache\n\nQ: It is reported in many Hadiths Trim closely the mustache, and let the beard grow. Also, there are reports for clipping fingernails, plucking hair under the armpits, and shaving pubic hair. Is there any difference between shaving and trimming? Some people only trim the lower half of the mustache, is this the trimming meant in such reports or should the whole mustache be shaved? Please inform me of the manner that should be followed regarding shaving the mustache. As for letting the beard grow, this is well established and it means that it should be left completely.\n\nA: All Praise is due to Allah Alone and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, his family and Companions. Authentic Hadiths narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) signify the validity of trimming the mustache, clipping nails, plucking the hair under the armpits, and shaving pubic hair. Some of these Hadith are: Trim closely the moustache, and let the beard grow to be unlike the disbelievers. Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: Trim closely the moustache, and grow the beard, and be unlike the fire-worshippers. According to some narrations: Trim closely the moustache. Since trimming stands for excessive cutting, a person may either clip the mustache closely until the upper lip appears or trim it because the Hadith permitted both. However, letting the two edges of the mustache grow (Part No. 5; Page No. 132)\u00a0is not permitted. The Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) on this is either to clip the mustache completely or trim it completely.May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.",

        "text":"\n\n\nForgot your password?\nUser Journal\n\nJournal Bible_Study_Guys's Journal: Introduction \/ FAQ 27\n\nAs it says in the Bio, this is an account shared by TechnoLust, glh, and eugene ts wong. We are going to attempt to do a Bible study in this journal every week. We will leave comments enabled for discussion. The email associated with this account is also shared by us, so you can reach us at that address.\n\nWho's crazy idea was this?\nThat would be mine. (-TechnoLust) I noticed that there are a great many journals about religion and moral issues around. Most people are very vocal of their opinion. I have always felt that God would use me to reach people in nontraditional ways. I felt that this would a good way for people to get together and discuss their ideas and beliefs with anonymity. Many people are more willing to talk about religion if it is anonymous.\n\nWhat makes you think this will work?\nFaith. :-) Actually, I just think that people want to discuss (notice I didn't write argue) religion and the Bible, and this seems to be an interesting venue in which to do that.\n\nWhy a shared account? Why not just do it your journal?\nSome of my \/. friends are Christians and would be interested in this. Others would not, and I didn't want them to stop reading my journal because they weren't interested in the Religion stuff. I also wanted to reach outside the FortKnox circle, if that's possible. :-) Because of my work schedule, I might not be able to dedicate enough time every week, and I didn't want to miss weeks or have the lessons suffer. So a shared account fixes a lot of these problems.\n\nWhy do this on slashdot?\nSeveral reasons... All of the people that I think would be interested are already here. People who might otherwise never come to something like this might stumble across us here. The interface is familiar. Most people that would be interested are going to be on \/. anyway, so adding us to their friend list and getting a message when a new lesson is available is not a big deal.\n\nHow are you going to deal with the ever-present trolls?\nWe will maintain a \"friends\" list of people who are posting in the journal, and a \"foe\" list of people who are trolling this journal. If you want, you can turn \"friend of friend\" & \"foe of friend\" modifiers on, and read at +1 or higher, so you won't see the trolls in the journal. Since this will be religious discussion, I imagine we'll get some bad trolls.\n\nWhy don't you guys do a lesson about...?\nIf you would like to participate in preparing Bible study topics or suggest a topic of study, email us at the address above. If you have questions, send those, and we will try to periodically do a Q&A session. If you would like to help, but don't have ideas for a topic, then pray for us.\n\nSo, are you guys starting a cult, or do you just think you are so perfect you need to tell everyone else how to live?\nNo, we don't want to start a cult, or the First Church of Slashdot. [If you are interested in joining a slashdot cult, click here. :-) ] We just want to discuss the Bible and religion. I don't think I'm perfect or better than anyone. I'm not sinless, just forgiven. You don't have to agree with everything we say, (that would make for a pretty dull comment section) but if you disagree, don't just say, \"You guys are wrong!\" Tell us why you think we are wrong, and explain your side politely and intelligently. I don't claim to be a minister. I've had no formal training, but I do love God and I think this is something He wants me to do. -TL\n\nThere's no religion topic icon, so are you randomly picking an icon when you post?\nNo. We will try to pick an icon that somehow relates to the lesson. It may even be that a \/. story under that topic triggered the lesson.\n\nThis discussion has been archived.

Disclaimer: I won't be throwing it out anytime soon, so it isn't really that disposable.\n\n    On an unrelated note: I'm surprised at how quickly someone has already trolled this journal.\n    \u2022 No, I knew trolls would be a problem. People who have no religion are tormented because they know SOMETHING has to be responsible for all this. Since they are tormented, they want to make sure those of us who know the truth and are happy get some torment as well. So they try to make us question our beliefs. All it does for me is make me glad I have the back bone to post logged in. :-)\n      \u2022 I think a lot of it is fear. People fear what they don't understand. Some non-religious people don't understand how one could be religious.\n\n        Yes, some non religious people are tormented by the need for an explanation, but many are not.\n\n        I am not a religious person, but I will probably follow Bible_Study_Guys journals and I may even ask some questions.\n        \u2022 Great! Questions are more than welcome..\n\n          I'm sure we will be posting more detail on this journal soon.\n        \u2022 I think a lot of it is fear.\n\n          I don't think its either. I think people troll religious people for two very opposite reasons:\n          1.) The amish factor - Religious people are not going to 'attack' you, personally. Its in their creed not to. So they take the beating and 'turn the other cheek' (heh, mathew reference...)\n          2.) The upset factor - One thing religious people don't enjoy is being told they are wrong, and it disturbs some of them noticably. There's nothing better to a troll than to see someone have a reaction to what they say (its the whole point of them trolling, right?).\n\n          Honestly, having a science background is nice in this respect. I am a Christian, but if someone wants to come and tell me I'm daydreaming, I'll listen to all their arguments, just never truely agree to them. I like to keep an open mind, its easier to show certain people the way of Christianity if you know how they think and what they think.\n          I also enjoy understanding other religions. I've taken out coworkers to have an understanding of hinduism and buddhism. Interesting stuff, IMHO.\n\n          BTW - This will be the best forum for your questions. You will get realistic and laid back comments that should (hopefully) be easy to read and keep you comfortable. I know to most people getting a 'tv evangelist' answer can make you comfortable and will tune most people out :-D\n      \u2022 People who have no religion are tormented because they know SOMETHING has to be responsible for all this.\n\n        Yes, and I am the one responsible for all of this. Fear me, for I am Elkobim, the god of the dice.\n\n        I hereby declare that nobody is going to be tormented for not believing in god. However, you must sacrifice dice for me.\n\n        Thank you very much.\n\n        I find the idea of \"bible study guys\" horribly ridculous.. The unproductivity associated with talking about ancient, unimportant stuff is equal to the importance of trolling in slashdot..\n\n        Btw: What's with the \"Foes of friends\" thingie? I can't agree with it. You can't just put people under your threshold because the commune decided they are \"bad people\". It's a perfect manifestation of groupthink.\n        \u2022 ...then don't read it. Those of us that know better will \"waste\" our time on it, and it doesn't harm you in the least. The foes of friends thing only works if you add this account as a friend. If you don't choose to do so, it won't affect you. All of these things we are doing are offered as choices, we are forcing no one to do anything they do not wish to. If someone wishes to read the trolls, all they have to do is change the foe of friend modifier, or not log in. We just know that some trolls have a tendency to use foul language, and offer our readers a way to filter it.\n\n          BTW - Unproductivity is not a word (check I think the word you were searching for was unproductiveness.\n\n    \u2022 are you kidding? I thought to myself, \"They're going to need their own special access to cope with the trolls and idiots\".\n  \u2022 I just warn you, unless warned I have a lot to say. :-)\n\n  \u2022 (distorted guitar starts)\n\n    Repent, repent, repent ye sinners\n\n    What do you think you got, when you thought you had a lot\n    But all your feelings are dead?\n    And who do you think you are, when you're reaching for the stars\n    But all your feelings are dead?\n\n    Must you make a decision, between sex and religion\n    Why can't you love God in your bed?\n\n    Well, Jesus Christ is in your bed tonight, to bring you back from the dead\n\n    How are you gonna fight for what you think is right\n    If all your feelings are dead?\n    And what can you know of love, from the eyes of a child to the heavens above\n    When all your feelings are dead?\n\n    It's a tragic condition, sex and religion, makin' a manic mess in your head\n\n\n    Jesus Christ, or any son of the heatless light\n    When all your feelings are dead\n\n\n    I raise my hands high up into the air\n    Get down on my knees and start-a-prayin'\n    When love walks in, my body begins\n    I feel my promised land comin', but I gotta go to Hell now\n    And those creatures, evangelist preachers\n    The ones that take money, for the promise of hope\n    Well, they are dangerous, I'm not dangerous\n    Brain washing us, and we're not gonna take it\n\n\n    I just wanna know, oh, Lord, how it is so\n    How is it that you can take my sins away?\n    Oh, Lord tell me, so I can see the light again\n    I don't think anybody can take my sins away\n\n    How can the truth be known, if we got little black holes in our souls\n    And all our feelings are dead?\n\n    Are we imprisoned by sex and religion\n    Or is God the one that's trapped in our mess?\n\n\n    Jesus Christ, or any son of the heatless light\n    To bring you back from the dead\n\n    [evil voice] So remember now folks, when you kneel to pray\n    Blow a little kiss to the hypocrites\n    Good God knows when you turn the other cheek\n    Wh...

Sunday 10:30 am\nWednesday 6:30 pm\nare good sources as well.\n\nSentinel Watch audio\n\nWe know you have questions - go ahead and ask them.\n\nIf we don\u2019t address your question here, you are directed to other resources on this page. (note:side boxes have local - RR info and church - and web links)\n\nChristian Science is not faith healing\nChristian Science does not involve pleading with God to heal the sick and then accepting His will, good or bad. Nothing in Christian Science theology says it\u2019s God\u2019s will that anyone suffer, be sick, or die. Christian Science shows God to be entirely good, and therefore His will for each individual is only health and life.\n\nIt\u2019s not positive thinking which relies on the human mind to think or effect a good result.\nChristian Science starts with God, who is divine Mind, and the conviction that God\u2019s goodness embraces each of us, all the time.\n\nAnd not a cult. There is no brainwashing, mind control, or blind following of a leader.\nChristian Scientists do have a deep respect and appreciation for the Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science, Mary Baker Eddy, but they do not worship her.\n\nChristian Science is very different from Scientology.\nThrough her search of the Scriptures, Mary Baker Eddy discovered the Christ Science. It is based on the teachings of Christ Jesus. Christian Scientists believe in one all-powerful, ever-present, loving God. They study the Bible daily and look to its inspired Word for guidance in every aspect of their lives.\n\nIt\u2019s based upon a set of spiritual principles\u2014laws relating to the nature of God and His creation\u2014that can be applied with expected, consistent results. Christian Science is based on the Bible, and Christian Scientists follow the teachings and ministry of Christ Jesus. The virgin birth, the crucifixion, the resurrection and ascension of Christ Jesus, and the healing work of Jesus, are all central to Christian Science theology.\n\nThere is no church mandate, no biblical mandate to forgo medical intervention, nor do Christian Scientists believe that it\u2019s God\u2019s will that anyone suffer or die. A Christian Scientist\u2019s decision to rely on prayer comes from trust, not blind faith, in God, and from a conviction that God\u2019s care continues under every circumstance.\n\nNo medicine for yourself \u2013 what about your children?\nChristian Science parents are like any other parents\u2014they love their children and want the very best care for them. They also recognize their moral and legal obligation to ensure that their children receive this care. Parents who choose Christian Science treatment for a child do so because they\u2019ve seen the effectiveness of this treatment in their own lives.\n\nWhat would you do if you broke your leg?\nMany Christian Scientists would tell you that they would naturally turn to God for healing because they\u2019d seen the effectiveness of this approach in the past.\n\nThis, however, does not prevent them from having a bone set if they so choose. The Christian Science Journal, Christian Science Sentinel, and The Herald of Christian Science also contain documented healings of broken bones.\n\nHow can you claim \u201cthousands of healings\u201d when in most cases there\u2019s no medical diagnosis?\nThere have been many Christian Science healings of conditions that have been medically diagnosed, and many medical confirmations of those healings. However, one does not need a medical diagnosis to know a person was ill and then healthy.\n\nWhat do you do in the case of communicable disease?\nChristian Scientists care about their neighbors and abide by city and state laws or mandates regarding quarantines, vaccinations, and the like. The Christian Science Journal, Christian Science Sentinel, and The Herald of Christian Science (found in Christian Science Reading Rooms) contain many documented healings of communicable diseases and show the role prayer can play, not just in protecting and healing individuals, but in helping communities as well.\n\nDo you lobby for exemptions to health laws?\nChristian Scientists seek accommodations in laws to ensure that healthcare choices include the system of spiritual prayer that they have found to be effective.\n\nDo Christian Scientists carry health insurance or life insurance?\nSome have health insurance, and most probably have life insurance. Every Christian Scientist makes his or her own financial and health decisions.\n\nChristian Science practitioners\nare self-employed individuals, who have completed a course in spiritual healing given by an authorized teacher of Christian Science, and who devote themselves full time to helping and healing others through prayer. While practitioners do not offer counseling, diagnosis, prognosis, or any physical manipulation or treatment, they do offer Christian Science treatment\u2014as explained in Eddy\u2019s book, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.\n\nChristian Science treatment is the application of spiritual principles\u2014who and what God is and what that means for each individual\u2014to the specifics of any given situation. These spiritual principles, applied, have a tangible effect\u2014restored relationships, financial well-being, physical healing, and so on.\n\nChristian Science Nurses and Care Facilities are also available when assistance or care is needed for an individual relying on Christian Science treatment.\n\nThe heart of Christian Science is Love. It is about feeling God\u2019s goodness. It is based on the Bible and is explained in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures and other writings by Mary Baker Eddy.\n\nIt addresses major points about God, good and evil, life and death, sacrament, salvation and more. There is much more information at including videos of how people live the teachings of Christian Science.\n\n\nThe desire of every Christian Scientist is to see the suffering in the world alleviated, and Christian Scientists take encouragement from Jesus\u2019 example in healing even the most extreme suffering. He overcame poverty, hunger, severe weather, even incurable mental and physical maladies\u2014and he promised his followers they could do the same.\n\nThe Church\u2019s does not take an official position on abortion, cloning, and other \u201chot-button issues\u201d. These are all serious issues, and they deserve everyone\u2019s deep thought and prayer\u2014including Christian Scientists\u2019.\n\nDo you pay any attention to problems like poverty, racism, genocide, famine, etc?\nThese are certainly problems that need addressing, and this is the reason Mary Baker Eddy founded the newspaper The Christian Science Monitor\u2014to alert the world to these problems and to invite solutions. Many Christian Scientists find their prayers regarding these issues lead them to take practical steps.\n\nThe Christian Science Journal, Christian Science Sentinel, and The Herald of Christian Science, along with Churches of Christ, Scientist, regularly offer healing responses to these problems as well as ideas to help each individual address them through prayer. These publications are all available in the Christian Science Reading Room \u2013current issues, a 120 plus year library of archived issues, and a searchable electronic library.\n\nStill have questions?
