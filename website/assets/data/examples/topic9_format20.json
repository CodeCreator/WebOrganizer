The term may also apply both to co-operatives contracting with Primary Care Trusts or Primary Care Organisations to provide out-of-hours care and to a co-operative providing such care on behalf of its members. In the latter case, members pay to benefit from the co-operative\u2019s services and are themselves paid for the work that they do for the co-operative. The typical such co-operative is owned and staffed by General Practitioner (GP) principals. A GP using the co-operative to provide out-of-hours cover pays a fee for the service. The doctors working for the co-operative are most often paid a session rate, so much per shift worked.\n\nLocal Health Authorities have allocated funds to reimburse any non-doctor costs of a GP\u2019s membership of a co-operative. Such costs may, for example, include communication equipment (pagers, telephones, fax machines, etc), premises, non-medical staff costs and so on. Equipment costs are likely to be capital. Capital contributions by the GP to the co-operative will not be allowable.\n\nFor administrative convenience, payment may be made direct to the co-operative. But the reality is that the payments belong to the individual GP who may then pay them to the co-operative together with the balance of their contributions for the services that they receive. In strictness the payments from the Local Health Authority should be shown in the GP\u2019s own (or partnership) accounts, either as a professional receipt or netted off against payments to the co-operative.\n\nIt is essential that you establish all of the facts before venturing an opinion as to whether the co-operative carries on a trade and if such trade is a mutual trade.",

All other snapshots will be taken at random times chosen by the Kalmar team to protect our users and ourselves from bad actors.\nThat means that the more snapshots in which you are registered, the more you distribution of the airdrop you will get.\nIf you lend 10 BNB to the bank for 1 snapshot out of 10 total (10%), your allocation will be proportional to 1 BNB.\nIf you lend 10 BNB to the bank for 5 snapshots out of 10 total (50%), your allocation will be proportional to 5 BNB.\n\n\nWhat's an airdrop?\n\nAn airdrop is an event in which the project distributes digital assets (coins, tokens, NFTs, and so on) to users, with the most common requirement being using the protocol itself.\n\nHow do I qualify for Kalmar's airdrop?\n\nIn order to qualify for our airdrop users have to provide BNB coins to the bank and\/or yield farm with more than 1x leverage.\n\nWhat's a snapshot?\n\nA snapshot is an event that records and saves the state of the blockchain at a specific block height to be later used as data.\n\nI'm lending\/borrowing, do I qualify for the airdrop?\n\nAs long as you've been lending\/borrowing at the time of the snapshot, yes, you qualify for our airdrop.\n\nWhen are the snapshots taken?\n\nWe are taking between one or two snapshots a day.\n\nHow long you'll be taking snapshots?\n\nWe will take snapshots until the day the KALM tokens launches.\nWe do not have an exact date for the launch of the KALM token, but we can estimate the launch to be within May 2021.\n\nIs it too late to participate in the airdrop?\n\nDepends when you're reading this, but as long as the token is not released, no, not at all!\nAgain, we're taking snapshots every day, don't focus only on the first snapshot as there are many.\n\nIs there a minimum of BNB I have to use to participate in the airdrop?\n\nThere is no minimum when it comes to providing BNB to the bank, however, the farms do have a 0.5 BNB minimum debt ratio.\n\nFor whom was the first snapshot?\n\nThe first snapshot only included the funds in the bank, every snapshot after that also includes the farms.\nLast modified 9mo ago",

The principle in that case was extended by the Court of Appeal in CIR v Woollen (an Order 14 appeal (see below) not reported) by providing that a properly constituted contract displaces the three elements in it and takes on an identity of its own when it comes to the collection of the composite debt.\n\nYou must make sure that the wording of the letters of offer and acceptance (COG914570) allow\n\n  \u2022 for legal action if payment is not made and\n  \u2022 the use of a shortened procedure (except in Scotland) known as Order 14 proceedings.\n\nThis shortened procedure can be used in court proceedings for the recovery of sums due under the contract when HMRC\u2019s Solicitor is able to swear that he knows of no defence to the action.\n\nIn these cases, even if the taxpayer attends the hearing, judgement is normally given in favour of HMRC because the validity of the contract cannot be refuted.

It also includes processes for other offices to request returns and for in-service and out-service customers to request and receive program products.\n\n  1. Section 1.13.11 was updated to remove the reference to IRM 1.15.25, which is now obsolete. A reference to the new Records Schedule, Document 12990, was added.\n\n(2) Added Exhibit 1.13.1-1, which details SOI\u2019s performance measures reporting.\n\nEffect on Other Documents\n\nIRM 1.13.1, dated December 3, 2015, is superseded.\n\n\nSubmission Processing Centers\n\nEffective Date\n\n\nBarry W. Johnson\nStatistics of Income\n\nStatistical Reporting Overview\n\n  1. 1) This IRM section provides procedures and information to National Headquarters and Submission Processing Center employees about the services and programs provided by the Statistics of Income (SOI) office. It describes the IRS statistical programs, procedures for providing information to the Submission Processing centers, and the processes for in-service and out-service requests. It also covers delegations of authority for reimbursable services.\n\n  2. SOI is an office in Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics (RAAS) and conducts the IRS statistical programs. As part of its responsibilities, SOI programs and services include:\n\n    \u2022 Selecting data for the SOI samples\n\n    \u2022 Collecting and disseminating SOI statistical data\n\n    \u2022 Making SOI returns available to other IRS functions\n\n    \u2022 Statistical processing of returns selected for the SOI samples\n\nLegislative Authority for SOI Programs\n\n  1. Since 1916, SOI has been authorized to prepare a series of reports and publications in accordance with IRC 6108, Statistical Publications and Studies.\n\n  2. SOI programs fulfill a statutory requirement for producing statistics on the operation of the tax law under IRC 6108, Statistical publications and studies. Under IRC 6108(a), \"the Secretary shall prepare and publish not less than annually statistics reasonably available with respect to the operations of the internal revenue laws, including classifications of taxpayers and of income, the amounts claimed or allowed as deductions, exemptions, and credits, and any other facts deemed pertinent and valuable.\"\n\n  3. SOI performs related research and other statistical functions needed to meet this requirement. SOI also assists in the quality measurement programs of the Service.\n\n  4. SOI programs include studies of:\n\n    \u2022 Individual tax return statistics\n\n    \u2022 Corporate tax return statistics\n\n    \u2022 Special studies, including exempt organization, estate and gift, and international tax return statistics\n\n  5. Implementation of programs occurs in the\n\n    \u2022 SOI office in the National Headquarters\n\n    \u2022 Submission Processing Centers\n\n    \u2022 Martinsburg Computing Center\n\n  6. SOI also furnishes technical guidance and direction to the submission processing centers and Martinsburg Computing Center to implement the SOI programs. Such guidance may be related to any phase of the statistical work, including the identification of problems and the development of solutions, and often requires written procedures, including those necessary for the selection of samples.\n\n  7. To assure that program implementation is correct, SOI evaluates the SOI work performed by the submission processing centers through:\n\n    \u2022 Quality assurance programs\n\n    \u2022 Internal audit reports, and\n\n    \u2022 On-site reviews of the SOI field processing operation.\n\nSOI Studies and Reports\n\n  1. SOI conducts special statistical studies based on tax returns or performs certain functions related to statistical studies, often on a reimbursable basis. In the latter capacity, it provides data to agencies and individuals authorized by the Internal Revenue Code to receive tax return information for statistical use.\n\n  2. Major SOI products include the annual SOI reports compiled from individual and corporation income tax returns, which feature income statement, balance sheet and tax data by industry and form type. Customers most frequently use:\n\n    1. Individual Tax Return data - Number of returns; sources of income; statutory adjustments to income and itemized deductions by type; personal exemptions; tax liability and tax credits classified by taxable and nontaxable returns or by size of adjusted gross income or tax rate.\n\n    2. Corporate Tax Return data - Number of returns; receipts and deductions by type; net income; tax liability and tax credits; and assets and liabilities classified by industry groups, returns with net income, and size of total assets or business receipts.\n\n  3. SOI also compiles a \"Source Book\" of corporation statistics, by asset size for more detailed industries than those included in the published annual report.\n\n  4. SOI also compiles historical data tables for corporations, sole proprietorships, and partnerships. Most SOI studies are summarized for public use in the SOI Bulletin. The Bulletin includes\n\n    \u2022 Data formerly published in separate reports,\n\n    \u2022 Summary analyses of previously published tabulations, and\n\n    \u2022 Results of special studies and analyses\n\n  5. Copies of SOI reports for official use are distributed\n\n    \u2022 Throughout the IRS\n\n    \u2022 Within the Treasury Department, and\n\n    \u2022 To certain other Federal Government users, including the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT).\n\n  6. SOI makes its reports available to the general public on http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/uac\/Tax-Stats-2. These Web pages include annual reports, Source Books, historical data, SOI Bulletins, tabulations, and microdata files for tax-exempt organizations.\n\n  7. SOI produces public-use files as a by-product of some of its programs. In most cases, because of the need to preserve taxpayer confidentiality, the files consist of tabulated data on the Tax Stats Web pages. However, the Web pages include individual records for tax-exempt organizations, which are required to make their returns available to the public. Additionally, SOI produces a public-use file of individual income tax returns, which contains separate tax return records, stripped of identifying information and edited to prevent disclosure.\n\nStatistical Processing Instructions\n\n  1. (1) The following IRM sections provide statistical processing instructions issued by the Statistics of Income office.\n\n    Program Area IRM Section Summary Audience\n    Individual Tax Returns 3.49.5 Individual Returns Statistical Processing Submission Processing Centers\n    NAICS Coding 3.49.6 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) coding for Statistical Processing Submission Processing Centers\n    Corporate Tax Returns 3.49.7 Corporate Returns Statistical Processing Submission Processing Centers\n  2. IRM 3.49.5, Statistical Editing of Individual Tax Returns provides instructions for statistical processing and editing from individual income tax returns for use by submission processing centers, computing centers, and the National Headquarters. The instructions include statistical processing procedures for math error correction, reporting discrepancy correction, and statistical coding.\n\n  3. IRM 3.49.6 and IRM 3.49.7 provide instructions for statistical processing from corporation income tax returns and related forms and schedules for use by submission processing centers, Computing Centers, and the National Headquarters office. Also included are instructions for performing other functions, including quality review, necessary for the complete statistical processing of the returns.\n\n    1. IRM 3.49.6, Industry Coding, includes instructions for statistical coding of corporate returns using the North American Industry Classification System.\n\n    2. IRM 3.49.7, Form 1120 Statistical Editing, includes procedures for statistical processing and editing of corporate tax income tax returns. The instructions include statistical processing procedures for math error correction, reporting discrepancy correction, and statistical coding.\n\n\n  1. SOI compiles comprehensive data from individual income tax returns annually in both \"preliminary\" and final form.\n\n  2. The Treasury Department Office of Tax Analysis (OTA) and Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) receive Advance Data tabulations based on an early cutoff of the sample receipts. The cutoff is Individual Master File posting cycle 39. (This same cutoff is then used for the \"preliminary\" ' data released to the public).\n\n  3. SOI also compiles data from:\n\n    1. Corporations, non-farm sole proprietorships and partnerships annually and development of these data is funded, in part, by the Department of Commerce. The data include business receipts, net income, and other selected financial items, by industry groups.\n\n    2. Estate tax and gift tax returns and tax-exempt organization and bond returns annually.\n\n    3. Other types of returns, such as certain international returns, are compiled occasionally.\n\n  4. SOI regularly produces estimates of personal wealth based on estate tax returns. This information is classified by age, sex, marital status and type of wealth for that segment of the population for which an estate tax return would be required in the event of death.\n\n  5. SOI also undertakes special studies to link together data from certain returns, e.g., estate tax returns with individual income tax returns.\n\n  6. SOI provides results of all of these studies to OTA and the JCT, and most are summarized for release in the SOI Bulletin.\n\n\n  1. SOI programs are generally based on samples of returns obtained from the Master File system. In order to obtain the required data, a plan for sampling is devised each year for the various types of returns included in the programs.\n\n  2. SOI issues editing instructions that describe data collectio... (truncated)",

ALMOs manage, repair, improve and maintain the council\u2019s housing stock. The ownership of the housing stock remains with the council which is also the legal landlord, and tenants remain secure tenants of the council. ALMOs also undertake a range of other services for their council that help deliver broader local authority functions, for example advice to council tenants, dealing with arrears, debt counselling, tenancy enforcement, allocations and lettings, administering the homeless and private sector housing functions such as grant administration, collecting rents from the tenants as agent for the council, grounds maintenance and community safety initiatives.\n\n\nThe council funds the ALMO for carrying out these services on its behalf by way of a \u2018management\/contract fee\u2019. The funding comes from the council\u2019s housing revenue account (HRA) and in the event of the ALMO being wound up or otherwise dissolved the memorandum and articles of association will normally state that any surplus remaining must be paid or transferred back to the council\u2019s HRA. Any monies held by an ALMO must be applied solely towards the promotion of its objects as set out in its memorandum of association. Therefore the funding received from the council must be applied by the ALMO in meeting its council member\u2019s objectives.\n\nTaxation status\n\nAn ALMO is a separate legal entity from the controlling local authority\/council and therefore it does not benefit from the exemption from Corporation Tax granted to local authorities. As an incorporated entity it comes within the tax definition of \u2018company\u2019 and is therefore within the charge to Corporation Tax.\n\nWe have reviewed in detail a typical ALMO, and have had discussions with the National Federation of ALMOs. The arrangements that we have seen, between an ALMO and its council member, lack the necessary element of commerciality to amount to trading.\n\nWhen dealing with an ALMO, provided its memorandum and articles of association and arrangements are in line with that described in the preceding paragraphs, you may accept that the transactions between the ALMO and its council member do not amount to trading.\n\nHowever, where the ALMO offers its services to third parties for reward, those transactions will be trading transactions.\n\nBecause transactions between an ALMO and its council are not trading at all, there can be no question of them being mutual trading transactions.\n\nAny case of doubt or difficulty not covered by this guidance, and any cases where the trading status of ALMOs is in question, should be referred to CTISA (Technical) prior to the commencement of enquiries.",

Funds which show neither a surplus nor a deficit (that is, the cumulative net cash position is exactly $0.00) will not appear on this report. For each fund, the report shows the current-year operating (surplus)\/deficit, the current-year cash effect of other activity not included in the operating (surplus)\/deficit, the current-year net cash position, the prior- year cash position, and the cumulative cash position.\n\nSince balances for a fund may be associated with multiple schools\/centers, the 205.SCH report displays each school\/center's contribution to the fund's net surplus\/deficit position.\n\nThe Surplus\/Deficit report provides balances for funds in the following fund groups: General Operating Funds (but not the 000000 fund), Designated Investment Income Funds, Designated Gift Funds, Other Unrestricted Funds. Please note that this report can not be used to report any other fund group activity.\n\nReport Break:\n\nThe report break determines the page-break, the first level of sort order, and the level of aggregation for the report.\n\nReport 205.SCH provides a page break to show funds with a Surplus separately from funds in a Deficit position.\n\nSort Order:\n\nFunds are sorted first according to the school\/center associated with the Resp Org. Within school\/center, two different sort order options are available when reporting surplus\/deficit status. The first option lists accounts by FUND\/RESP ORG value within Fund Group sequence*. In this option, totals are provided by fund group, and for the endowed and gift fund groups, sub-totals are also provided by fund. The second option lists accounts in RESP ORG\/Fund Group\/FUND sequence. Totals are provided for each Resp Org and fund group, and for the endowed and gift fund groups, sub-totals are also provided by fund.\n\nReport Template:\n\nThe 205.SCH report uses Template 1A to determine which objects codes are included. Only the rows from the section at the bottom are included; they become the columns in this report. For the details of which object codes are included in each of these, see\n\n\nIn addition to the Accounting Period (Period Name), the following parameters are provided for account selection on the 205.SCH report:\n\n  1. Resp ORG Low\/High: Unlike other BEN Financials GL reports, the 205.SCH uses the Resp ORG parameter as both an ORG and Resp ORG value. The value supplied in the Resp ORG parameter is used to construct an implicit \"ORG or RESP ORG\" condition so that the report can retrieve information for the common funds, like the service center fund.\n\n  2. Net Asset Class: Valid choices are '0', '1', or \"S\" ['0' is the default value]\n\n    Value Description\n\n\n    Selects NAC 0, unrestricted.\n\n\n    Selects NAC 1, temporarily restricted.\n\n\n    Selects the sum of NAC 0 and NAC 1 combined.\n\n  3. Report Option: Valid choices are '1', '2', or '3' ['1' is the default value]\n\n    Value Description\n\n\n    Selects both the Surplus and the Deficit reports.\n\n\n    Selects only the Deficit Report\n\n\n    Selects only the Surplus Report\n\n  4.

Description\n\n    The alphabetic descriptions associated with the School\/Center value is provided.\n\nReport Columns:\n\nFrom left to right, the report columns will provide the following balances:\n\n  1. FUND-RESP ORG or RESP ORG-FUND: Depending on the sort parameter selected, this column displays either the Fund value followed by its Responsible Organization or Responsible Organization followed by Fund for the balances on the row. Note: for the common funds, the value displayed in this column is the ORG associated with the balance, rather than the true Resp ORG for the fund.\n\n  2.

We recommend that you keep this parameters page with the report to document what the report includes.\n\n  1. Report Parameters\n\n    The parameters used to request the report are printed on the last page as confirmation of what was requested. If the funds returned to you in the report are not what you expected, the report parameters list is a useful first place to start. At a minimum, you can verify the range of values you provided at the time you submitted the request.\n\n  2. Report Break -- Resolved Parameters\n\n    The list provided here represents the list of values within the range you provided as Report Parameters that passed security verification. When a report is submitted, RESP ORGanization parameters that were provided are compared with your BEN Financials security profile. All ORGanizations in the range that match your profile will be returned to you in the report.\n\n    This is a good second place to look if you did not get the results you expected. Compare the list of RESP ORGanizations in this list against the parameter range you provided. If a RESP ORGanization is missing, chances are it does not exist in your security profile.\n\nComptroller Spotlights\n\nGL Object Codes FY2018\nConcur Expense Type\/Object Code Matrix (2018)\nFY2017 Closing Instructions\nFY17 Closing Calendar QRG\nGuide to Year-End Closing\nSchool Closing Summary Template\n\nBEN Offices\n\nBEN Deposits\nBEN Financials\nOffice of the President Home Page Penn A-Z Directories Calendar Maps\nCopyright \u00a9 , University of Pennsylvania\n3451 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104 \u00b7 215.898.5000\nCopyright Information | Contact Us | Privacy Policy\n\nPenn Home\nVisit Penn's website",

        "text":"Content Options\n\nContent Options\n\nView Options\n\nBSOG 2.2 Preliminary matters\n\nRationale for a merger\n\nBSOG 2.2.1G\n\nIt is a matter for the board to decide whether to recommend a merger to its members. The overriding duty of the board is to reach a view having regard to what is in the best interests of the society, and its members as a whole, both present and future, borrowing members and shareholding members. The board may also reasonably consider the interests of customers who are not members, of the staff, suppliers of goods and services, and of the wider community.\n\nBSOG 2.2.2G\n\nA well planned and well matched merger can benefit both the shareholding and borrowing members and the staffs of both societies by producing a combined society with the financial strength and management expertise and experience needed to compete successfully in the market place. It must be recognised, however, that in many instances it will take time for economies of scale to be achieved and a careful assessment of projected costs is essential to a realistic view of whether such economies are likely to be achievable. On the other hand, a merger between two weak and over-extended societies may produce an even weaker one. It is better to negotiate a merger from a reasonably secure position than to be obliged to seek a merger when the society has become too weak to carry on as an independent entity.\n\nBSOG 2.2.3G\n\nThis chapter cannot deal exhaustively with all the factors to be taken into account by a board when deciding whether to recommend a merger to its members. Moreover, there will be factors peculiar to particular cases. However, the following paragraphs draw attention to those matters which the Authorityexpects boards to consider in all cases.\n\nBSOG 2.2.4G\n\nConsideration of a merger can normally be expected to emerge from the board's regular consideration of the strategic options available to the society. That is not to say that merger as a transferor society should always figure as an option in every society's corporate plan. On the other hand, every board should be alive to business trends which point to, or which, if not altered, will point to, the need to consider options for merger. In short, a merger should be foreseen and planned. Alternatively, of course, a board which wishes its society to remain independent must have a clear strategic view of how that can be achieved in a variety of realistic planning scenarios. Whether or not a board is considering a merger, it should as a matter of prudence, know how it would respond to a proposal or counterproposal to merge or to transfer its business to a commercial company.\n\nBSOG 2.2.5G\n\nIf a board foresees the possibility of a merger, then it should plan for that eventuality. Societies which see themselves as transferees will need to consider the desired characteristics of potential partners, including, for example, geographical presence, mortgage book quality, and product market share. Societies contemplating the transfer of their engagements will need to consider whether the interests of their members would best be served by a local or regional alliance or access to a national network of branches and services. The board may also reasonably consider the interests of customers who are not members, of the staff, suppliers of goods and services, and of the wider community. It is also reasonable, particularly for local and regional societies, to consider the implications for the local economy, where, for example, a regional or head office may eventually be closed to achieve economies of scale.\n\nBSOG 2.2.6G\n\nThe range of issues which both boards have to consider will vary from case to case and is for the board to decide. At one end of the scale there will be the case where a small society merges with a large one and, at the other end, where two or more societies of broadly comparable size join to form one significantly larger. Whatever the proposal under consideration the board will necessarily have regard to this primary duty to reach a view on what is in the best interests of the society, and its members as a whole. It will also be conscious of the need to give an account of the boards rationale in recommending the merger to members, in particular if a statutory merger statement is included in the Merger Document (see paragraph BSOG 2.3.23 G).\n\nTerms of a merger\n\nBSOG 2.2.7G\n\nThe terms negotiated between the parties in a merger will be set out in a formal agreement. In the case of a transfer of engagements, Section 94(6) of the 1986 Act requires the extent of the transfer, and in practice the other agreed terms, to be recorded in an Instrument of Transfer. For an amalgamation, Section 93(2) of the 1986 Act requires the parties to agree on a Memorandum and Rules for the successor society, and each to approve the terms of the amalgamation by Merger Resolutions, so that there must be agreement on the terms. The Authority will expect the Instrument of Transfer or amalgamation agreement to be signed before the Authority approves the Schedule 16 statement, although it will be conditional on, among other things, approval by members and confirmation by the Authority. In both cases the boards of the societies will have approved the Instrument or agreement and the Schedule 16 statement and, in the case of an amalgamation, the Memorandum and Rules of the successor society. Before such approval by the boards, drafts of the proposed Memorandum and Rules should have been cleared with the registration team. The Rules of transferee societies should provide that members of transferor societies are not disenfranchised for any period after the merger is effected (see paragraphBSOG 2.3.16 G and rule 4(9) of the BSA Model Rules 5th edition).\n\nBSOG 2.2.8G\n\nAlthough vesting of the property, rights and liabilities of the transferor society in the transferee society on completion of a transfer of engagements is a statutory process by virtue of Section 94(8) of the 1986 Act, the Instrument of Transfer performs an important function. Not only is it required by the 1986 Act, but it is required to identify the extent of the transfer (Section 94(6)), since a transfer can be of all or part of the engagements of the transferor society. Thus, on a transfer of all the engagements of a society, the Instrument of Transfer should include a specific statement that all are included. If the transfer is of part only, then the instrument should specify precisely what is being transferred. As explained, an amalgamation agreement is required in practice for all amalgamations, but again the actual process of transferring the assets of the societies to, and vesting them in, the new society is by operation of the 1986 Act. Section 93(4) of the 1986 Act, which does this, does not allow for exceptions to the vesting since the nature of an amalgamation is that all the assets of all the societies are vested in the successor society.\n\nBSOG 2.2.9G\n\nThe Instrument of Transfer, or amalgamation agreement, will also allow matters of detail to be recorded. So it will contain, for example, provision for:\n\n  1. (1)\n\n    any changes to the terms and conditions of PIBS and share and deposit accounts, including the integration of the product lines of the transferor society(ies) into those of the transferee or successor society;\n\n  2. (2)\n\n    any changes to the terms and conditions of mortgage accounts and other loans;\n\n  3. (3)\n\n    any bonus to be paid to members;\n\n  4. (4)\n\n    the terms and conditions on which staff will be employed or made redundant;\n\n  5. (5)\n\n    pension scheme arrangements;\n\n  6. (6)\n\n    integration of operations;\n\n  7. (7)\n\n    the terms and conditions on which directors and other officers are to continue in office or cease to hold office, including the posts they will hold and any extra-contractual compensation to be paid for loss of office or reduction in emoluments;\n\n  8. (8)\n\n    the specified target date for completion of the merger, bearing in mind that the actual date is a product of the 1986 Act (Sections 93(3)(b) & (4) and 94(8)), and for action if that date is not achieved;\n\n  9. (9)\n\n    any conditions precedent, such as members votes and the Authoritysconfirmation, and for the circumstances in which the Instrument or amalgamation agreement might be terminated.\n\nBonus Payments to Members\n\nBSOG 2.2.10G\n\nWhether any bonus is to be paid to members and, if so, its amount and distribution, are matters to be agreed by the boards of the societies concerned and to be approved by their members, subject to the discretion described in paragraphs 4.41 and 4.42. However, the Authoritywill wish to be satisfied that the combined society will maintain a prudent level of capital resources after the bonus is paid. A bonus may, for example, be paid to the members of a transferor society with a higher capital ratio than the transferee society so as to equalise the reserves which both bring to the combined society. If it is thought desirable also to pay a bonus to the members of the transferee society, then the reserves of the combined society may be equalised at a level below the capital ratio of the transferee society, but only if it is prudent to do so. The statutory requirements for approval of bonus payments are described in paragraphBSOG 2.4.4 G.\n\nBSOG 2.2.11G\n\nA bonus is a distribution of the funds of either or both societies, and may be paid by a number of methods, or some combination of them, including, for example: a flat rate lump sum; a sum calculated as a percentage of balances; or an increase or (for mortgage accounts) a decrease in the interest rates paid or charged for a limited period. Maintenance of interest rate differentials existing before the date of completion of the merger between those offered by (say) the transferor society and the transferee society would not normally be characterised as a bonus. However, each society, and the Authority, will wish to be satisfied that any differential is consistent wi... (truncated)",

This is for reasons of fairness, transparency and efficiency. It will sometimes be appropriate to depart from this standard practice, for example:\n\n  1. (1)\n\n    For suspects or possible suspects in criminal or market abuse investigations, the FCA may prefer to question that person on a voluntary basis, possibly under caution. In such a case, the interviewee does not have to answer but if they do, those answers may be used against them in subsequent proceedings, including criminal or market abuse proceedings.\n\n  2. (2)\n\n    In the case of third parties with no professional connection with the financial services industry, such as the victims of an alleged fraud or misconduct, the FCA will usually seek information voluntarily.\n\n  3. (3)\n\n    In some cases, the FCA is asked by overseas regulators or EEA regulators to obtain documents or conduct interviews on their behalf. In these cases, the FCA will not necessarily adopt its standard approach as it will consider with the overseas regulator or EEA regulator the most appropriate method for obtaining evidence for use in their country.\n\nEG 4.7.2RP\n\nFirms, approved persons and conduct rules staff1 have an obligation to be open and co-operative with the FCA (as a result of Principle 11 for Businesses,1 Statement of Principle 4 for Approved Persons and Rule 3 of COCON 2.11). The FCA will make it clear to the person concerned whether it requires them to produce information or answer questions under the Act or whether the provision of answers is purely voluntary. The fact that the person concerned may be a regulated person does not affect this.\n\nEG 4.7.3RP\n\n2The FCA will not bring disciplinary proceedings against a person for failing to be open and co-operative with the FCA1 simply because, during an investigation, they choose not to attend or answer questions at a purely voluntary interview. However, there may be circumstances in which an adverse inference may be drawn from the reluctance of a person (whether or not they are a firm or individual1) to participate in a voluntary interview. If a person provides the FCA with misleading or untrue information, the FCA may consider taking action against them.1\n\nEG 4.7.4RP\n\n2If a person does not comply with a requirement imposed by the exercise of statutory powers, they may be held to be in contempt of court. The FCA may also choose to bring proceedings for breach of Principle 11,1 Statement of Principle 4 or COCON 2.1.3R1 as this is a serious form of non-cooperation.",

The clearing house acts as a \u2018middleman\u2019 or \u2018central counterparty\u2019, matching and guaranteeing the performance of securities ordered and placed by buyers and sellers on an electronic share trading system, i.e. the LSE SETS system. Member of an exchange must use the clearing house appointed by the exchange.\n\nTrading is carried out through members of the clearing house, either on their own behalf (referred to as proprietary trading) or on behalf of a client. The clearing house acts as an intermediary for the trades. So, for any purchase by a client of a member, the member will have an equal and off-setting purchase contract with the clearing house which will in turn have an equal and off-setting purchase contract with another member who represents the seller.\n\nRecognised Clearing Houses:\n\nIn order to provide the services of a clearing house in the UK, it is necessary to be designated as a Recognised Clearing House (RCH) or a Recognised Overseas Clearing House (ROCH) by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nIn order to be recognised, RCHs must comply with the recognition requirements laid down in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Recognition confers an exemption from the need to be authorised to carry on regulated activities in the UK.\n\nClearing houses that have been \u2018recognised\u2019 by the FCA include:\n\n  \u2022 Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited\n  \u2022 European Central Counterparty Ltd\n  \u2022 ICE Clear Europe Limited\n  \u2022 LCH Clearnet Limited\n\nRecognised overseas clearing houses include:\n\n  \u2022 Eurex Clearing AG\n  \u2022 ICE Clear US Limited\n  \u2022 SIS x-clear AG\n\nSome exchanges do not use a clearing house and are able to clear their own trades if they recognised by the FCA as a Recognised Investment Exchange (RIE).
