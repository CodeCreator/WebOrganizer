Despite its importance, troubleshooting and maintaining a reliable voice network and end-user experience has always been challenging. Irrespective of the type of voice deployment (on-premises, hybrid or cloud), the impact of the underlying network on voice performance is undeniable. Packet loss, jitter and latency influence voice quality and the sometimes transient nature of these issues makes VoIP troubleshooting tricky.\u2026 Read More \u00bb\n\nMonitoring IPv6 Networks\n\nPosted by on May 31st, 2017\nNovember 10th, 2017\n\nIPv6 has been around for two decades, and yet it is only now making up a meaningful portion of Internet traffic. Reports today find that there are between 10-15 billion Internet-connected devices (each requiring an IP address), yet only 2.8 billion routed IPv4 addresses. The conclusion? Most connected devices do not have unique, public IPv4 addresses and instead utilize network address translation (NAT) to communicate with the Internet.\u2026 Read More \u00bb\n\n2017 Update: Comparing the Performance of Popular Public DNS Providers\n\nPosted by on May 15th, 2017\nMay 25th, 2017\n\nIn May 2015, guest blogger Mehmet Akcin wrote about his findings from measuring and comparing latency to a number of popular public DNS services from hundreds of vantage points located across the globe.
