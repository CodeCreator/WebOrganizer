        "text":"The Parliamentary Activities Allowance (formerly known as the Party Leader\u2019s Allowance) is provided for in the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938 as amended most recently by the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices)(Amendment) Act, 2014.\n\nThe allowance is paid to the parliamentary leader of a qualifying party in relation to expenses arising from the parliamentary activities, including research, of the party. Payments are made in respect of members of the party elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and members elected\/nominated to Seanad \u00c9ireann at the last preceding general election or a subsequent bye-election or, in the case of Seanad \u00c9ireann, nominated to it after the last preceding general election. The legislation also provides that payments may be made to a member of D\u00e1il or Seanad \u00c9ireann who is elected other than as a member of a qualifying party- i.e. an independent member.\n\nThe conditions governing entitlement to payment of the allowance are set out in the Act. The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses. The allowance increases in line with general pay increases in the Civil Service and is not subject to income tax.\n\nThe amount payable to party leaders is calculated on a tiered basis by reference to the number of party members who are elected or nominated to the D\u00e1il or Seanad and is fixed at the time of the election, or following a bye-election, as follows:\n\n\n\u200b\u200bParty TDs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200b\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annual Rate per Member\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Government Parties *\n\n\u200bFirst 10 Members\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u20ac64,368\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200b\u20ac42,912\n\n\u200b11 to 30 Members \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u20ac51,493\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200b\u20ac34,329\n\nMore than 30 Members \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u20ac25,754\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200b \u20ac17,169\n\n\n*The legislation provides that, in the case of a qualifying party forming part of the Government, the combined allowances due in respect of TDs of that party are reduced by one third.\n\n\nParty \u200bSenators \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Annual Rate per Member\n\n\u200bFirst 5 Members \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u20ac42,089\n\nMore than 5 Members \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u20ac21,045\n\n\nThe annual rates applicable to independent members of D\u00e1il and Seanad \u00c9ireann are \u20ac37,037 and \u20ac21,045 respectively.\n\nThe legislation provides that each party leader and independent member must prepare a statement of expenditure for the allowance, to have it audited by an independent auditor and furnish it with the auditor\u2019s report to the Standards in Public Office (the Commission) Commission.

Structure and Meetings. All decision-making power rests in the membership, which shall meet at least quarterly. Members will be notified by the Secretary of the time, date, place and agenda of general membership meetings, which will normally occur in Miami \u2013 Dade County.

If consensus is still not achieved, those in dissent can stand aside and allow the group to proceed, and the essence of the dissent will be noted. If those in dissent believe the issue at hand is so fundamental that they are unwilling to stand aside, the issue will be tabled to be decided at the next general membership meeting, unless 2\/3 of those present believe an immediate decision is critical, in which case an immediate democratic non-secret vote will be taken, at which only those in attendance may vote and a 60% majority will be required before action will be taken on the proposal.\n\n5. Officers.

Regular membership shall be limited to individuals who affiliate with the Republican Party, who have paid current minimum dues and who support the purposes of the Caucus, as defined by the Statement of Principles. Regular members are qualified to serve in any official capacity in the Caucus (assuming they also meet any other specific qualifications for the position), to act as delegates at any Convention and to enjoy all the privileges extended in these Bylaws. If a question of eligibility for Regular membership is raised with the Board, the Board shall hear evidence presented by the Secretary and make a final determination by a simple majority vote.\n\nB: Student membership shall be limited to individuals who are currently enrolled as a student in an educational institution, and shall confer the same privileges as regular membership above.

Any member suspended or revoked by a State charter organization shall have the right to appeal to the National Board of Directors within 90 days, and the National Board of Directors shall render a decision within 90 days of appeal.\n\nAmendment #2\nArticle VIII: State\/Regional Charters\n\nSection 1. The Board shall encourage and certify the Chartering of state or regional Caucus organizations in the United States of America which qualify under the provisions of these Bylaws and Rules. A State Charter may be granted to any group of ten or more Regular members who are residents of the subject state and who have signed a Petition for Charter and submit it in writing to the Board of Directors. A Regional Charter may be granted to any group of 6 or more Regular members who reside in a common geographical area. The Board may certify qualified State or regional charters by a majority vote at its next regular meeting. Charters for the District of Columbia or any United States territory or possession may be approved by the Board and granted the same status as State Charters.\n\nSection 2. The Board may set such minimum criteria for State or regional Charter Bylaws and require such verification of Regular membership as it deems appropriate for certification.\n\nSection 3. The Board may suspend or revoke a State or regional Charter by a 3\/4 vote whenever a Charter is shown to be in violation of its own, or National, Bylaws and Rules.\n\nSection 4. The Board may appoint Coordinators for any unchartered state or territory of the United States for the purpose of facilitating the development of a local Caucus organization.\n\nAmendment #3\nArticle V: Officers\n\nSection 1. The Officers of the Caucus shall consist of a Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer, who shall all be voting members of Board and subject to the provisions of the preceding Article. Candidates for Officer shall have been Regular members of the Caucus for at least one year prior to their nomination. Candidates for Chairman and Vice-Chairman shall have been Regular members for at least two years and a voting or alternate member of the Board of Directors for at least six months prior to their nomination.\n\nSection 2. Elected Officers shall assume office at the close of the Convention at which they are elected. Any Officer may be dismissed for misconduct or malfeasance upon thirty days notice to the Officer and a majority vote of all members of the Board. Any Officer vacancy may be filled by a majority vote of all members of the Board. New Officers must qualify under the provisions of the previous Section and shall assume office immediately upon election by the Board. If Officer vacancies occur between Board meetings, the seceding officer listed in the preceding section, followed by At-Large Board members,\nshall serve as the acting Officer until the next meeting of the Board.\n\nSection 3. The Officers shall perform such duties as are prescribed in these Bylaws.\n\nA. The Chairman shall be the primary spokesman of the Caucus; shall execute the resolutions of the Board of Directors; shall preside at meetings of the Board and official sessions of any Convention, unless absent or replaced by an Acting Chairman, and shall ensure the administration of all provisions of these Bylaws.

The Treasurer shall be the custodian of all Caucus funds, shall propose annual and quarterly budgets, safeguard the financial resources of the Caucus and make such periodic reports of finances as the Board may require.\n\nThe following amendments were proposed to our statement of principles and positions:\n\nAmendment #4\n\nWe recognize that there are diverse and sincerely held views on civil marriage within the Republican Liberty Caucus and the Republican Party. We encourage and welcome a thoughtful conversation among Republicans about the meaning and importance of marriage.\n\nWe support an end to any government role in the definition or administration of marriage. The role of state governments should be limited to the registration of civil contracts of union. Until this becomes the standard practice, equal protection under the Bill of Rights requires that the federal government act to insure that all adult individuals have the freedom to marry and to have their marriages recognized by all levels of government.\n\nAmendment #5\nLife & Health\n\nAll individuals have an inherent right to life and to sovereignty over their own body and personal welfare.\n\nThe proper role of government is to protect the rights of the minority and, as in all aspects of health care, should be strictly limited. Government is not qualified to decide who should live, who should die, or what level of care people should be allowed to have and every person should be responsible for their own health and wellness decisions.\n\nWe favor civil discussion and robust debate of the abortion issue acknowledging that there can be honest and ethical differences of opinion and interpretation of the scientific and civil liberty aspects of the issue.\n\nIn keeping with our general opposition to government involvement in healthcare decisions, we oppose any allocation of government funds or resources to facilitate abortion, advocate in the public discussion, or to jeopardize the right of any woman to defend her own life and health.\n\nWe support resolving this issue through the proper judicial and legislative channels specified in the Constitution.",
