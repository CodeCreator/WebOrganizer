Foaming and scum formation are serious detractions from the goal of crystal clear spa and hot tub water. Spa chemicals generally do not cause foaming, although biguanide can cause some low level foaming. The most common cause is the reaction of body oils and cosmetic residues with the natural alkalinity of the water. This can lead to the formation of \"soaps\" and the possibility of a foamy water problem. While an anti-foam can help, the problem may recur. Foaming spa water can be controlled and eliminated with the use of Enzyme Products and avoiding \"soft\" water conditions. Proper sanitation requires that all foam be eliminated periodically, because the foam can support a microorganism population and may not contain adequate sanitizer.\u00a0If problems arise, refer to the Spa Problems Page, as a source of problem-solving information, broken down into various categories.\u00a0 Scroll down the page and click on the linked keywords, catch phrases or images, in the archived answers below, to access additional information, on that topic or product.\n\nSign-Up for our e-mail list, Join our E-Letter Mailing List.\nYou'll receive 1-3 E-Letters a month, featuring helpful pool and spa advice, new product information and sale announcements.\u00a0 All we require is your e-mail address and you can opt out anytime you wish.\nYour information will never be shared or sold.\n\n\u25bc\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Helpful, Problem-Solving Information, in a question and answer format. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc\n\nToo much Anti-Foam?\n\nGreat web site and I searched everywhere for a answer first. And I also asked my spa dealer and a chemical company and neither bothered to reply. By a stupid mistake I put way too much anti foam in my spa\u00a0 tub. It turned the water cloudy and two weeks later still cloudy. Is my only option to drain and refill?\u00a0 Thank you for your time.\u00a0 Best regards.BlasterAutomatic Filter Cartridge Cleaners for pools and spas.\n\nMichael G,, 10\/3\/2016\n\nThe anti-foam is pretty harmless stuff and is probably food grade.\u00a0Unfortunately, it is an emulsion and cannot be filtered out.\u00a0 Your best bet is to drain and clean the spa.\u00a0 Make sure you thoroughly clean the spa filter, as well.\u00a0 When adding anti-foam, adding more is not necessarily going to make it work better.\u00a0 I am sure that this will solve the problem.\n\nSincerely.\u00a0 Alan Schuster, 10\/3\/2016\n\nThank you Alan, You are the only one to take the time to answer my question. I have asked chemical sellers and even the place I bought the spa from. You have a customer for life on any product I need that you carry.\u00a0 Best regards.\n\nMike, 11\/4\/2016\n\nFoam In A Spa?\n\nWhat causes foamy water in a spa? What's the best way to deal with the problem?\n\nEd W., 12\/2\/2013\n\nBathers contribute body oils to the water, as a result of the warm water. These body oils can react with the natural alkalinity of\nOne of the ColorQ all-digital, pool and spa water analyzers. the water and form \"soaps.\" Add aeration and you get foamy spa water. You can use a spa formula Anti-Foam Product to help break the foam. An Enzyme Treatment can be added periodically, in order to digest or decompose the body oils and prevent the formation of these \"soaps.\" Soft water will support more foaming. Keeping the calcium hardness level in the 150-200 PPM, can help suppress foaming. Water testing is important and tests, such as calcium hardness and total alkalinity are also\u00a0important, in terms of foam control. I recommend the ColorQ PRO 7 Digital Water Tester, which does all the important tests, without color-matching or guesswork. It is important to completely eliminate all foam, for some period of time. This is necessary, in order to assure proper sanitation, because the ecology of the foam is different from that of the water. I hope that I have been helpful. Enjoy the spa.\n\nSincerely. Alan Schuster, 12\/2\/2013\n\nWhat's In An Antifoam?\n\nAlan, great site, I immediately added you to my favorites. One question regarding spa anti-foam solutions: all other products I use list their active and inert ingredients and % on the label, but not so with anti-foam products. Can you tell me\u00a0more about\u00a0the chemical is that is typically used, the %, etc, so I can look up the MSDS info, as I have done for Potassium Peroxymonosulfate, for example. Thanks.\n\nKlausen H., 1\/29\/2014\n\nAnti-foam products are not pesticides and, as such, do not require that same type of ingredient disclosure, that is required of products such as chlorine or algaecide. At least not in the U.S. The various products, currently on the market, are not necessarily all based upon the same formulation or have the same activity content. Virtually all spa antifoam products are based upon a silicone oil in a non-ionic emulsion. The silicone content will vary depending upon the packaging and marketing strategy. A 10% silicone content would be a reasonable ballpark figure. These products are used a very low levels and have a low order of toxicity. In a spa, the elimination of all foam, at least periodically, is important for proper sanitation. If you have an ozonator, it can help reduce the foaming problem, by breaking down the foaming materials. I hope that I have been helpful. Enjoy the spa experience!\n\nSincerely. Alan Schuster, 1\/30\/2014\n\nA Spa With A Head?\n\nSometimes my spa gets so much foam on top it looks like a head on a beer. I use bromine tablets and non-chlorine shock. I never use fragrances or other similar products. So which chemical is causing the foam? Thanks a lot.\n\nJack l., Erie, PA, 10\/25\/2016\n\nActually, none of the chemicals are responsible. Body oils from bathers, react with the natural alkalinity of the water and form \"soaps.\" The air jets create the foamy water. It is important for good sanitation reasons to eliminate all foam, at least temporarily. Foaming can be controlled with additions of anti-foam products. Enzyme products can help eliminate the body oils and reduce \"soap\" formation. If your spa water is soft, raising the calcium hardness to 150-200 PPM will help reduce foaming. I hope that I have been of assistance.\n\nSincerely. Alan Schuster, 10\/25\/2016\n\nStill Dealing With Foam?\n\nI know you thought you were through with me, but I still have a little issue with foaming. The spa I own has 4 pumps. On each of these pumps is a feature called therapy jets that increases the pressure of the water coming from each pump.\u00a0When I run pumps 1, 3, and 4 without the therapy jets, there is zero foaming in the spa. But if I turn on pump 2 or add the therapy jets to any of the pumps, the spa foams. I've drained and refilled and this still happens. The water is sanitized correctly, I use the stain and scale preventives and water clarifiers the manufacturer recommends, and it has the correct hardness. Now what is happening to the spa? Thanks.\n\nRick F., Cabot, AR, 6\/13\/2013\n\nThe foam is mostly likely being caused by the reaction of body oils and\/or cosmetic residues with the natural alkalinity of the water. This causes the formation of soaps. Try adding a weekly dose of an enzyme to help digest these byproducts. Make sure that the calcium hardness is about 200-250 PPM, in order to reduce foaming. Good luck and I hope that this information proves helpful.\n\nSincerely.

It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nMy kids like to play with Lego bricks on the floor, and sometimes a small piece will fall in to a heating register. Sometimes I can pull them out, but usually they fall too far, and there are sharp edges that like to draw blood.\n\nIs there something I can do to block bricks from falling in, without interfering with air flow?\n\nlego bricks peering in to the abyss\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n6 Answers 6\n\nup vote 14 down vote accepted\n\nI like the idea of a smaller grate, but make life easy and get some regular fiberglass screen material at the hardware store and wrap the register cover with it and reinstall the cover. Cheap, easy and safe.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIs there fiberglass screen which doesn't significantly affect airflow? \u2013\u00a0 wallyk Jul 16 at 19:13\n\nA mesh made of steel wire 2-3 millimeters in diameter with cells about 5 millimeters in size would solve the problem completely. If you can't find it readily available at a store you can spend some time soldering it on your own - will take time, but the result will be sufficient.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThis will also keep rodents from entering and exiting the ductwork through the registers. \u2013\u00a0 Matthew Sep 14 '12 at 15:04\nHardware Cloth is the technical name and 1\/4\" mesh (US measure) probably fits the ticket. Cut it to size to go under the register louver assembly (all the ones I've ever dealt with are lift out) and a 1 ft length will probably give you enough to protect 4 registers. The 1\/4\" mesh won't have too much restriction on the airflow, but should keep all but the littlest pieces from going down. You can get 1\/8\" mesh if you think a 1\/4\" opening is too large. \u2013\u00a0 Fiasco Labs Sep 15 '12 at 1:52\n\nGet some window screen mesh, you can buy it in rolls at the hardware store. Cut it so it forms a pocket below the register, and attach with velcro tape under the register to the side of the duct.\n\nThis should trap anything that falls through so you can lift the register and grab it easily. The window screen mesh shouldn't block the airflow in any significant way.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI worry that such a fine mesh would restrict the flow of air too much. I definitely feel the difference in breeze when a screen is over an open window. \u2013\u00a0 Jay Bazuzi Jan 12 '12 at 2:12\n\nAn Air Deflector might make it harder for the Legos to find their way into the vent, just make sure you get one that wraps all the way around the vent to prevent Legos from sliding in along the floor.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIt might also make it more of a target, like carpet putting. :-) \u2013\u00a0 wallyk Jul 16 at 19:13\n\nGrowing up, my mom never let us play with Lego on the bare floor -- we had an old queen sized blanket that we spread out, then just grabbed the corners to lift it and store in a box for storage. It was easy to notice when the Lego were getting to the edge, and thus had to be pulled back in to the middle.\n\nIn this case, if you positioned the sheet so it went over the register, it'd block the register, but nothing would fall in while they were playing.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nWhat about cutting the bottom out of a shoe box and then putting it around the register? (Kind of like those dog collars from the vet that prevent the dog from licking a wound\/part of their body.) This would protect any pieces from rolling into the register (but also might encourage your kids to put more in). It definitely would not look the prettiest but maybe it would not matter for this room.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

This shrub has red tips on its new growth and is often used for hedging although it is subject to some disease problems. Left untrimmed, this is actually more like a small tree and blooms in spring.\n\nFor summer bloom you might prefer Hibiscus syriacus or Rose of Sharon. This shrub blooms for a long period in summer and into fall and is available in a number of shades of pink as well as white and near-blue.

Hi Tonya, The Simon has not been designed with a basement floor plan yet, but a basement can be added to any of our designs. We can make them fully underground through our regular ordering process or you can modify the basement to be a walkout through our custom modifications. The designer will determine the best location for the staircase, it is common for us to move the garage forward a few feet without disruption any of the other features of the design.\n\n  14.

Is it really that hard to replace this toilet seat? Do I buy just any standard size seat or what to look for?\n\nHelp and Thanks\n\nAnswer Question\n\nAsked by Anonymous at 1:08 AM on Aug. 5, 2009 in Home & Garden\n\nAnswers (8)\n  \u2022 all you have to know is of it is round or oblong..why do women rely on men for everything?\n\n    Answer by Anonymous at 1:18 AM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 Once you get the right size seat (round or oblong), you unscrew the nuts that hold it on, put the new one on, and tighten the nuts. There's nothing to it--it's a five minute job (and that includes getting the new seat out of its box).\n\n    Answer by SWasson at 6:46 AM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 so funny. yup, you can do this. testicles not required.\n\n    Answer by jewjewbee at 8:27 AM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 measure it (or take it with you); go to a hardware store. it takes about 2 minutes.\n\n    Answer by rkoloms at 9:52 AM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 It is not hard to change a toilet seat. I do this everytime I move into a new rental property. Go to Home Depot or Lowes and pick one up. You just need a screw driver.\n\n    Duct tape on a toilet seat is kind of gross so you should do this right away.\n\n    Answer by Niki_sd at 11:21 AM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 They are easy to change...if you don't see the screws on the hinges just remove the cap over the hinge. Unscrew....remove seat...bring with you to store to make sure you get the right size....\n    go home...screw new one on toilet seat. !\n\n    Answer by jjessers at 2:39 PM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 Ive changed probably 15 toilet seats (boys are ROUGH with toilet seats.. LOL) seriously it isn't that hard.. Go to the store buy a seat that is similar to the one you have now , there really aren't THAT many choices to choose from you buy it, bring it home.. Pop up the little cap things behind the toilet seat, unscrew the screws, remove seat, throw away.. Then put the new seat down onto the toilet, screw the little screw things back in put the caps back down and voila a new toilet seat!\n\n    Oh and btw, toilet seats are fairly cheap too,.\n\n    Answer by KalebsMommee at 5:46 PM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 I just bought a new toilet seat with the child seat connected to it. They're not expenisve. You look at your toilet and see if it's a round boul or oblong bowl. That is it. Oh and the color is white if the toilet is white not bone or off white.\n\n    Answer by SylviaNCali at 9:18 PM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\nJoin CafeMom now to contribute your answer and become part of our community.
