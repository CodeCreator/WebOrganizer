Many can be prised off with a flat-bladed screwdriver they have a spring system holding them, but some have a tensioning arrangement that has to be loosened.\n2 After removing the outer clamp band, locate the inner one securing the seal to the drum and establish how this is secured. It may be necessary to loosen a clip, or you may be able to prise the band off with a flat-bladed screwdriver. Some are like very large Jubilee clips that you have to undo usually from the top.\n3 Once the clamp bands have been removed, use both hands to pull the seal away from the inner drum rim. Some machines have a water spout holes that will have to be lined up. Others have a drain holes.\n4 Rubbing a drop of washing up liquid into the groove on the door seal\/gasket that locates on the drum makes fitting the new seal easier.\n5 the new washing machine door seal should be fitted by locating the drain holes at the bottom of the seal first then push it on with both hands working opposite directions towards the top.

Remove the wire around the door seal, repositioned the seal around the edge of front panel porthole. There is a folded metal edge around the metal frame and the grey rubber gasket lips over this, once in position, offer up the metal retaining band and use a pair of long nosed pliers to stretch the spring so you can get it to sit around the seal. Sorry this a little long winded but very difficult to articulate properly, so I hope you get the gist.

I think my husband is about to throw it down the garden!! thanks\n\nthe door seal or do you mean the rubber boot that goes from outter tub to the outer frame simply seat the seal all the way around into the groved slot on the rubber boot and then attach the top of the retaining ring first and slide the left side on while holding the corner of the right side move your screwdriver from the top left furthest point in a couter clockwise direction until the metal retaining ring is half seated you can see down the bottom there is a small spring that allows the tension on the other side you would hold with a finger the last point that you seated the retaining ring and start on the top right side with your flat screwdriver and work your way clock wise until you came to the are with the spring then just put your screwdriver in the area where the spring is located and pry towards you walla this piece is also called door bellows to others as well it is termed as a rubber boot where I am currently if you have any further questions message me back and please remember when our chat has fully concluded to rank how this opinion has helped it allows me to help others in similar situations Thanks Rick\np.s tomatoes dont grow particulary well with washer machine on top on the other hand a type of berry would have no problem at all :)\n\nApr 10, 2011 | Zanussi ZWF1420W Front Load Washer\n\n1 Answer\n\nHow do I get that metal loop around the rubber gasket at the door? It is metal wire with a spring.\n\nTake a flat bladed screwdriver or similar tool then insert it to where the retainer spring connects to the wire hoop at the bottom of the door seal and pull the retainer forward and then off the perimeter of the boot. You may also use a pair of needle-nose pliers to grasp and pull the assembly at the location shown below.\n\nReinstall the spring and wire hoop assembly by starting at the top then working simultaneously around on both sides going to the bottom of the door seal\n\nAug 18, 2010 | Kenmore Elite 45986 Front Load Washer\n\n1 Answer\n\nWater leaking out of door , seems like it might be a problem with the door hinge ?\n\nNot likely that you have a hinge problem, but it can happen, especially if water has been dribbling down the back side of the front panel from the dispenser area, getting on the hinge, and causing it to bind up. Replacing the hinge is a pain because the screws are put in with thread lock, requiring heating or even drilling in some cases. If you have water dripping down the front of the machine from the door, the most common reason is that there is some lint or hair on the bottom side of the glass door, preventing a complete seal to the gray rubber gasket. Generally, just cleaning off the bottom of the glass door will fix it. If that does not do it, you can try moving the spring clamp (which holds the front of the gray tub seal) from the bottom (6 O'clock position) to the hinge area (9 O'clock position) Sometimes, the leak is caused because someone pushed the washer into place by placing their hands just below the door and actually deformed the metal front panel inward, preventing a seal between the door glass and the gray tub seal. If that is the case, it may be corrected by removing the spring retaining clamp, taking the front of the gray tub seal off, pulling outward a bit on the metal panel at the bottom of the door openings, and replacing the seal and retaining band again.\n\nMay 09, 2010 | LG TROMM WM2688H 4.0 cu.ft. Front Loading...\n\n1 Answer\n\nI need to clean between glass plate and oven door on my Zanussi electric cooker. I have drips where I've wiped the door over, also there is dust in between. Model ZBF 360W, Serial 61705615, Prod. No....\n\n\nThe following worked on my zbf360x built in Zanussi.\nFirst you need to remove the oven door. To do this open the door half way. On each hinge there are two small metal flaps. Lift both of these. Now with the door still half open pull hard on the door. You will find the hinges spring and if you release the pull now it will just spring back. When the hinges spring give an extra hard pull on one side and then the other each hinge should pop out.\nOnce you have the door off just remove the small screws on the bottom of the door to allow it to hinge open and clean the inside glass.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\nSep 29, 2009 | Ovens\n\n1 Answer\n\nZanussi washing machine door seal removal\n\nThis is quite tricky, first take off the retaining ring on the front door port, remove the seal from this rim. The back of the seal is held by a spring band. the best way to remove it is to get a good grip on the seal at the top then lift and pull (thats the easy bit), to put the new one on i always lubricate the recess on the seal with washing-up liquid and feed the seal on from the bottom with one hand whilst following it around with the other hand to stop it coming off. Once it is fully on it can then be rotated easily into the correct position. Getting the spring back on will require an extra pair of hands for obvious reasons.\n\nGood luck with it and keep the swear box handy lol.\n\nThank you for using fixya\n\nNov 26, 2008 | Zanussi ZWF1440 Front Load Washer\n\n2 Answers\n\nReplacing a rubber door seal on washer machine\n\n1.

I have occasionally spread grit over my (heavy Wealden clay) over the years and together with regular mulching with compost and manure it has helped enormously. My soil is now much easier to work. I was advised not to use sand but I can't remember why.\n\n27 Mar, 2011\n\n\nHi Lm298 and welcome to GoY. If there is any possibility of the sawdust containing varnish then you should not use on your garden. Take it to the recycling centre. The varnish will taint your soil...\n\n27 Mar, 2011\n\n\nI am not using sand as it contains no nutrients for the garden. I only use sand for drainage around bulbs. I also mix in compost and mulch - am seeing an improvement to the heavy already.\n\n27 Mar, 2011\n\n\nLimestone, bone meal, and\/or epsom salts often help, too, by \"flocculating\" the clay--that is, making the tiny particles stick together in sand-sized clumps.\n\n28 Mar, 2011\n\nHow do I say thanks?\n\nAnswer question\n\n\nNot found an answer?",

        "text":"Breaking a dog's bad habit\n\nI have a 5-year-old black lab who has a nasty habit of eating other dogs' feces if she's not carefully watched. She's in good health, eats organic dry food, and is exercised regularly. We've tried everything to break this habit \u2014 even our vet is at a loss. Any ideas?\n\nIngesting feces is known as coprophagia. It is considered normal behavior during certain life stages, e.g. it's normal for nursing mothers to eat their own puppies' feces and for a young puppy to sometimes eat it. We're not sure why healthy adult dogs that are eating high-quality food eat their own feces. It's possible that some dogs like it so much or are never discouraged from doing it that it becomes a lifelong habit and in some cases a truly compulsive behavior.\n\nYou did the right thing by taking her to your vet to rule out a possible medical reason. We can now assume this is a behavior problem. The short answer on how to break this habit: Don't let her do it. Here are some tips:\n\nSupervise your dog closely when she has access to other dogs' feces. This means you should keep her on a leash in areas where other dogs eliminate. If she lives with other dogs and\/or other dogs visit, pick up poop immediately so she doesn't have the opportunity to practice the behavior.\n\nBuild a solid obedience foundation that includes a reliable recall. When your dog is off-leash you can call her away from the feces before she gets to it. Also teach your dog the \"leave it\" cue \u2014 defined as either do not touch, ignore, or move away from that object \u2014 and the \"drop it\" cue for times you don't catch your dog in advance of her eating the feces.\n\nUse a loud sound or device to startle your dog when she gets close to the feces. If your dog is sound sensitive a simple loud clap may work. If not you can use a shake can or air horn. If you don't make progress within a few weeks, consult a professional trainer.\n\nThis weeks' expert is Certified Professional Trainer\/Behavior Consultant Pauline Houliaras, president of B-More Dog.

        "text":"Which pool will be most tolerant of dog hair?\n\n\nI am looking into starting a k9 swiiming pool. I need recommendations on which pools will be most tolerant of the hair.\n\nThanks,- Jennifer G.\n\nAnswer (by Cindy Horsfall):\n\nHi Jennifer!\u00a0You can read the following topic on the ACWT website:\u00a0What kind of pool or spa should I get?\n\nWhen choosing a pool, the filter and circulation system will be very important. It\u2019s best to work with the pool contractor or manufacturer of the spa\/pool to set up a system that will be able to handle large amounts of hair. Filter and pump sizes are all dependent on the pool or spa size you select.\n\nPools and swim spas are usually built for people and pool maintenance companies always talk about hair nets and such\u2026 so most pool contractors and companies aren\u2019t comfortable with HAIR\u2026 let alone DOG HAIR\u2026 so this is where you need to ask for them to think outside the box. You need to beef up any circulation system to push that hair through the filters. You should pay attention to the hair catch pots in your pool and can even ask for more or bigger catch pots which are designed to catch the hair BEFORE it goes to the filters. Some like the cartridge filters for hair as you don\u2019t have to clean them but just toss them away and put in another one, while sand and DE filters you have to clean and backwash.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nPosted in ACWT, Pool Basics.\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"One of my male chickens loves making trouble and gets into fight with the other gentle male chicken almost all the time. An article I read said in this type of cases debeaking the stubborn male is a viable option.\n\nBefore doing so, I want to understand the full process of debeaking, I have read some articles but I still need advice on some issues.\n\nWhat are the negative effects (health and behavioral) that debeaking will have on my chicken?.\n\n\nBeak-trimming will always cause a deprivation of sensory input in the beak, an important source of information in birds, and the end goal should be the avoidance of beak-trimming altogether through genetics, housing conditions, and management. \u2013 Philip C. Glatz, ed., Beak Trimming, 2005, p. 77.\n\nThe arguments against debeaking are:\n\n  1. Debeaking is often done improperly and in such cases has been shown to be chronically painful to the chicken.\n  2. Debeaking makes foraging very difficult.\n  3. Debeaking hinders the chicken from normal preening.\n  4. Debeaking makes eating more difficult.\n  5. Some owner's feel that debeaking can be physiologically harmful to the chicken and may make birds act shell-shocked and skittish\n\n\n\nYou've already received an excellent answer, but I just wanted to add my recommendation that I feel that beak-trimming should be avoided.\n\nI would also strongly advise against housing roosters together. While there may be some exceptions, in general, housing two males together is going to result in aggression. Beak-trimming may deprive the aggressor of his main \"weapon\", but it can lead to other problems (difficulty eating, etc.) and is by no means an optimal solution.\n\n  \u2022 3\n    This. The best answer is to not de-beak, and to only house one cock instead.\n    \u2013\u00a0rlb.usa\n    Dec 18 '13 at 18:18\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy",

We have had her for one year. She is\n\nCustomer Question\n\nMy dog is a rescue dog. We have had her for one year. She is three years old, she panics about things and she nips and bites at times. She also barks at every noise and people.\nSubmitted: 3 years ago.\nCategory:\u00a0Dog Training\nExpert:\u00a0 Jane Lefler replied\u00a03 years ago.\nHi JaCustomer,\nMy name is Jane. I have been working professionally with animals especially dogs in both health and behavioral issues for over 18 years. I have over 14,000 satisfied customers. It will be my pleasure to work with you today.\nIn order to supply you with the best information, I do need to ask for some additional information. Once I receive your answer, it will likely take me about 30-45 minutes to type up your response. I hope you can be patient.\nIs she nipping as a result of her panic or are they separate issues?\nDoes she nip and bite you (her owners)?\nIs she allowed on furniture?\nWhat obedience training has she had?\nCan you give me some details on when she has nipped or bit including what was going on before, during and what your reaction was?\nHow do you discipline her?\nWhat breed or closest one is she?\nIs she spayed?\n\nCustomer: replied\u00a03 years ago.\n\nThey are seperate issues.\n\nShe nips and bites owners and visitors when we try to leave the house or hug each other any time.\n\nShe is allowed on furniture only when we say she can.\n\nNo obedience training-not great with other dogs but knows many commands which she follows, but she ignores any commands when we leave the house.\n\nShe has bit\/nipped when shut in a separate room when the door goes, and often when my 16 year old daughter tries to stop her getting out of the front door after i leave the house- i ignore her. Bites any time somebody picks up a handbag or puts shoes\/cardigan on.\n\nTo discipline Bella, we reward positive behaviour and we ignore negative behaviour, sometimes shut the door on her when she barks so she stops instantly.\n\nBella is a Sprollie- Springer x Collie and has been spayed.\n\nExpert:\u00a0 Jane Lefler replied\u00a03 years ago.\nThanks for that information. It sounds like she is a dominant dog. Dominant dogs will nip and bite to reprimand the other pack members when they feel they are doing something the dominant dog does not approve of. IN this case, apparently she doesn't like people leaving or stopping her from leaving indicated by her biting when people do those things that indicate they are getting ready to leave her.\n\nSo to correct this situation, you need to establish all the humans as the bosses and her as the lower ranking member of the pack. The fastest way of accomplishing this is formal obedience training. YOu don't have to go to formal classes initially as you can train at home and involve everyone. However, eventually you need to finish her obedience training in an environment where there are distraction like a formal training class.\n\nThe following site is helpful for teaching you how to train your dog. Be sure and click on the link to the page on obedience at the bottom. and links on subsequent pages leading to detailed instructions.\n\nTraining works best if you train at least 30 minutes a day (two 15 minute sessions). I would start making your dog work via the Nothing in life is free program (NILF). It is outlined below.\n\nAs I mentioned, all the humans need to be involved with training. You also need to stop allowing her to be on furniture. It raises her physically to the same level as the humans so she feels equal or higher than the humans especially since she has teeth and is not afraid to use them. Keeping her on the floor will help lower her both physically and mentally.\n\nI recommend using hot dog slices or liver slivers for treats. They can be messy but are very effective at getting a dog to work (obedience train). When a dog obeys even if for a treat, it makes them just a little more submissive to that person naturally lowering the dog in the pack.\n\nShe is a herding breed so nipping comes naturally and she is likely to have a lot of energy, so you need to have an outlet for that energy. Try at least two 30-45 minute fast paced (not strolls) walks. You can get a back pack and add cans and water to exercise her even more.\n\nI would keep a short leash on her at all times to help with training. While I agree with positive training techniques, I also believe a dog should have consequences for misbhaving. You will be reprimanding her. A reprimand would be a short tug on the leash to break her concentration and a firm low toned, growl like \"NO\". This lets her know that the behavior is unacceptable. Rewarding her for the desired behavior is important as well. So if she doesn't bite when she would have previously. This helps her see what behavior you expect out of her instead of the bad behavior.\n\nYou can set up situations where she bites so you can use reprimands to correct her. Practice over and over such as someone putting on their shoes in front of her. Someone elses gives the reprimand if she goes to nip and rewards if she doesn't. She'll learn quickly how to get the treat and stop the nipping.\n\nYou can use the same reprimand and reward system to stop the barking. While you have been rewarding some behavior, you have no reprimands for bad behavior except shutting the door. Bark collars are very effective but the contacts have to be able to touch the throat, so the hair might need to be trimmed if you decide to try one.\n\nOnce she is pretty much trained, go to a formal class. In addition, teach her to sit when you are leaving. Have her sit while you open the door and reward her. Then have her sit while you walk out and back in so she starts to see you leaving as not necessarily being gone for a long time. She'll also start seeing that as an opportunity to receive a treat sinc eyou will be rewarding her. Of course over time, the treats will be reduced and praise used instead still throwing a treat in now and again to keep reinforcing the training.\nThese techniques should take care of the problems. I hope this information is helpful to you and you are satisfied with my response.

I am looking for some kind of bush\/shrub that gets fairly tall and also blooms in the summer time with pretty blooms. I need something to act as a barrier into my backyard. Any suggestions?\n\nAnswer from NGA\nJanuary 9, 2000\n\n\nYou may be thinking of Red Tip or Photinia serrulata. This shrub has red tips on its new growth and is often used for hedging although it is subject to some disease problems. Left untrimmed, this is actually more like a small tree and blooms in spring.\n\nFor summer bloom you might prefer Hibiscus syriacus or Rose of Sharon. This shrub blooms for a long period in summer and into fall and is available in a number of shades of pink as well as white and near-blue. It can be trimmed back hard each winter to control its size and keep it dense so it will provide a good barrier.\n\nYou must be signed in before you can post questions or answers.

        "text":"Possible Duplicate:\nHow can I get rid of a mouse in my house?\n\nOur first child is due any day now, and we've got a mouse infestation. We noticed it for the first time at my girlfriend's baby shower (lots of cakes and crumbs out), and since then we've started seeing it more frequently. I say \"it\", but we suspect more than one of them, based on other people's comments.\n\nThis was upgraded from \"something to deal with\" to \"major problem\" when my girlfriend found mouse droppings in the baby's room. We've put down poison traps in the kitchen, where the thing's been seen most often, but we're wondering what else we can do.\n\nOur principal concern is to keep the mice away from the baby's room (other end of the flat to the kitchen, but it doesn't seem to help). Obviously we'd like them gone completely, but it's terraced accomodation (shared walls), and we can't control our neighbours behaviour.\n\nWe're also concerned about leaving poison or traps in the baby room.\n\n  \u2022 3\n    Did you search before posting? The problem of mice has been covered before - diy.stackexchange.com\/search?q=mice \u2013\u00a0ChrisF Apr 20 '12 at 11:43\n  \u2022 Sure, but all of those are about keeping them out completely, and while we'll try, it may not be practical due to our neighbours, and the old rented accomodation not allowing us to bring down cupboards, etc. This is about keeping them away from \"high-value\" rooms like the nursery. \u2013\u00a0deworde Apr 20 '12 at 11:49\n  \u2022 see also diy.stackexchange.com\/questions\/6504\/\u2026 \u2013\u00a0BMitch Apr 20 '12 at 13:00\n  \u2022 Lots of the traps listed in the linked answers are non-poisonous, some are even non-lethal, which seems like a good solution when you have children around and don't like the idea of killing mice. \u2013\u00a0BMitch Apr 20 '12 at 13:04\n  \u2022 1\n    Keep in mind that an infant won't be crawling around on the floor for many months. Not to say you shouldn't be cautious about putting poison out near a baby, but be realistic about his\/her (in)ability to get into anything for at least 3-6 months. Or, get a cat. \u2013\u00a0Jason Apr 22 '12 at 23:22\n\nIf you look carefully the problem may be worse than you estimate.Remove drawers from kitchen cabinets and check inside for droppings.Check the lower shelves of cabinets and any where food is stored.Try to eliminate food sources,crumbs,pet food etc. should be cleaned up and stored in sealed containors.I would contact the property owner and the local health dept.In multi unit dwellings treating one unit doesn't stop the problem.You could try an plug in electronic pest controller although I don't know if they are available in your area.They emit a tone that the pests don't like but people don't hear.It would eliminate chemical exposure to the baby.Keeping the mice out of the babies room is only part of the solution as you may contact the mouse feces and then handle the baby.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n\nCall an exterminator, or if you rent, insist your landlord call an exterminator.\n\nPersonally, I feel a mouse infestation where they are in the main areas of your house crosses the line from \"pest annoyance\" to \"serious health issue.\" There are of course many things you can do on your own to repel or even eliminate mice, but if you have a baby on the way, you need the problem solved correctly, and quickly.\n\nTherefore this is one time when I would definitely get a professional's help.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n\n3 basic things to do:\n\n  \u2022 get rid of food access (put cereal in plastic tubs, grains in glass jars, etc.)\n  \u2022 block access (plug all holes in the structure...permanantly, if you can...otherwise use stainless steel wool)\n  \u2022 trap existing mice (I'm a fan of the glue traps...though they may not be the most humane, they do work)\n\nUnfortunately, in a shared structure, #1 and #2 are hard to do completely. I'd probably consider the exterminator as well (as the landlord can have them do the entire building...not just your unit).\n\n| improve this answer | |\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
