        "text":"The Application of Societal Marketing in Egyptian Travel Agencies\n\nGhada Hammoud, Soha Abd-Elwahab, Takwa Essawy\n\n\nThe concept of societal marketing emerged to promote a more socially responsible, moral and ethical model of marketing. It is an approach that adopts a holistic, integrated view of marketing, considering social equity, environmental protection and economic livability.\n\nSocietal marketing aims at marketing sustainable products and services which satisfy customer needs and significantly improve the humanistic marketing and the ecological marketing.\n\nThe past few years have seen a steady growth in the claims of adopting the principles of societal marketing as a new approach which has led to the creation of many initiatives to address concerns such as environmental conservation, social issues - such as poverty reduction and local and community economic development\u2026\u2026etc- and companies' responsibilities towards their employees. Promoting growth that respects culture and environment and supports the well-being of local communities is a crucial issue for the evolution of modern tourism. This requires the increase of awareness and the adoption of responsibility behavior by tourism businesses. Although there are opportunities as well as challenges to adopt societal marketing strategies in tourism business scale, there is a lack of awareness in Egyptian travel agencies of the meaning, principles, importance, requirements and activities of its applications. Thus, there is a need for tourism industry to be more aware of the meaning of CSR, its principles, benefits and its requirements to move the agenda forward (Momtaz, 2008).\n\nThis research aims to; Highlight the importance of the application of societal marketing in the tourism sector.Identify the practices of corporate social responsibility in tourism companies.Determine and analyze obstacles for the application of societal marketing in the Egyptian tourism sector Evaluate the application of societal marketing in tourism companies to set recommendations to fulfill the effective application to societal marketing and CSR.Provide suggestions for a successful implementation of societal marketing in Egyptian travel agencies.\n\nIt is concluded that although most tourists make purchasing decisions based on such factors as price, weather, type and range of facilities and quality, more and more tourists are also concerned about the ethics of travel and more likely to book a holiday with a company that has a written code guaranteeing good working conditions, protection of the environment and support of local charities in the tourist destination. The lack of CSR awareness, the absence of governmental support to adopt CSR programs, the lack of the budget that is needed for its activities, rare of experts in CSR field and the disbelief of the management in CSR importance and benefits were considered to be barriers that affect CSR engagement in tourism companies.\n\nField study indicated that Egyptian travel agencies tend to take some form of societal marketing applications but they are not familiar with the real meaning of this term and its practices.\n\n\nSocietal marketing, Responsible tourism, Corporate social responsibility (CSR)\n\nFull Text:\n\n\n\n  \u2022 There are currently no refbacks.\nScroll to Top",

[Dissertation (University of Nottingham only)] (Unpublished)\n\n[img] PDF - Registered users only - Requires a PDF viewer such as GSview, Xpdf or Adobe Acrobat Reader\nDownload (1MB)\n\n\nThe destination brand is defined as a \u2018name, symbol, logo, word or other graphic that both identifies and differentiates the destination; it conveys the promise of a memorable travel experience that is uniquely associated with the destination; it also serves to consolidate and reinforce the recollection of pleasurable memories of destination experience\u2019 (Ritchie and Ritchie, 1998, p.277).\n\nFurthermore, the destination brand is also defined as \u2018a unique combination of product characteristics and added values, both tangible and non-tangible\u2019 (WTO, 2007, p.45). Moreover, a destination brand is not just a trademark or logo, as products and brands are, but an experience and an image that indicates a value system and positioning. In other words it is a \u2018Promise\u2019 which establishes the experience that the tourist can expect from the destination (op. cit.).\n\nHankinson (2004) states that destination brands are strategically important since they communicate the identity of the destination, they improve value and they build relationships with visitors or suppliers. In addition, Cooper and Hall (2008) claim that a successful destination brand should be credible, deliverable and different while it should convey powerful ideas, enthuse destination partners and resonate with the visitor.\n\nThis project explores issues regarding destination branding and its importance. The research conducted for the purpose of the project focuses on the Greek island of Rhodes and on its branding procedure. Through the research the author managed to investigate and compare the image that the visitors of the island have with the image that the tourism authorities promote. Additionally, the logo of the island was analysed and investigated. The research produced interesting findings and they should be useful for the local authorities of the island and for the tourism sector in general.\n\nItem Type: Dissertation (University of Nottingham only)\nDepositing User: EP, Services\nDate Deposited: 05 Mar 2010 14:24\nLast Modified: 24 Jan 2018 01:15\nURI: http:\/\/eprints.nottingham.ac.uk\/id\/eprint\/23105\n\nActions (Archive Staff Only)\n\nEdit View Edit View",

A step-by-step conceptual model, based on Hollywood\u2019s scriptwriting formula, is developed, contextualised and employed for the case study destination of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. The model offers destination management organizations an innovative new method of developing a destination brand centred on storytelling while the findings demonstrate that the scriptwriting approach creates a narrative for the destination that connects the various experiences in an experiential framework which carves out a brand that promises strong emotional and experiential benefits for tourists. This paper provides an original and novel rethink of how to construct the destination experience and formulate the destination brand, employing scriptwriting capabilities, rather than traditional marketing concepts.\n\nItem Type: Article\nDivisions : Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences > School of Hospitality and Tourism Management\nAuthors :\nLund, Niels Frederik\nDate : 13 February 2020\nDOI : 10.1080\/13683500.2020.1739005\nCopyright Disclaimer : Rights managed by Taylor & Francis\nUncontrolled Keywords : Storytelling, Hollywood scriptwriting process, experience economy, myths, destination branding\nDepositing User : James Marshall\nDate Deposited : 16 Mar 2020 10:42\nLast Modified : 16 Mar 2020 10:42\n\nActions (login required)\n\nView Item View Item\n\n\nDownloads per month over past year\n\nInformation about this web site\n\n\u00a9 The University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, United Kingdom.\n+44 (0)1483 300800",

Today, tourists consider urban areas as tourist attractions since, in addition to the body which has its own charm,every space is dominated by an identity. In this descriptive, comparative study, the criteria determining the urban space identity are attempted to be specified through documentary studies. Then, 105 questionnaires were distributed among various user groups of the space including the residents and shopkeepers at Imam KhomeiniStreet, the citizens of Qazvin, tourists coming to the city since the beginning of the year 2014 and experts on Qazvin urban area. The urban space identity was specified by analyzing the questionnaires. Moreover, the main criteria determining such an identity were determined according to each group\u2019s view point using the Friedman test. The results of the study indicated that Imam Khomeini Street and its micro spaces had strong cultural and religious identities in the past. Furthermore, it was revealed thata historical identity had been also added to them over time. However, for various reasons, the identity dominating such urban spaces has declined in recent years, and have somewhat been forgotten. Based on the findings of this study,we can hope to attract historical and religious tourists into the city as well as urban spacesthrough putting an emphasis on historical and religious identity of Imam Khomeini Streetand its micro spaces.Among the proposed approaches, sufficient funding for the presence and accommodation of tourists, turning historic houses adjacent to Imam Khomeini Street to traditional accommodation for tourists and transforming abandoned spaces adjacent to Imam Khomeini Street to cultural spaces for attracting tourists, such as crafts workshops, theater, indigenous art gallery, traditional restaurant with local music, etc. can be named. Other approaches also include holding special programsfor introducing Qazvin such as festival of Qazvin Day in form of some various programs including music, theater, local festivals, etc. UR - http:\/\/soij.qiau.ac.ir\/article_526889.html L1 - http:\/\/soij.qiau.ac.ir\/article_526889_1d4fbd6cc02c18aa197eafc83786086b.pdf ER -",

        "text":"Benchmarking best practice in hotel front office: the Western European experience\n\nT. Baum, P. Odgers\n\nResearch output: Contribution to journalArticle\n\n\nDuring the past decade there have been significant changes in the hotel sector, the marketplace and its operations. This paper reports a research study across a number of western European countries into the changing functions within front office operations and the role of personnel in a range of hotels and locations. Issues addressed include the flattening of organisations; the increasing expectation of multi-tasking and multi-skilling; and creating a balance between technological solutions and the delivery of quality customer care. These issues are linked to wider findings on the growth in the need for the more generic skill types together with the importance of personal attributes as key selection criteria and the growing emphasis of the employers role in providing training for vocational skills. Work in these areas has seen a decline in routine activities and has become increasingly complex, involving the use of a wide range of software, maintaining in-house systems and the expectations of faster response to more complex methods of communications. Industry has realised the importance of customer care and the subsequent increase in focus by operators on its provision. These issues have led to the setting of procedures and benchmarks for the various functions and services of front office and the empowerment of employees in their implementation. The paper provides an insight into changes in front office and the manner in which technology is acting as an enabling force rather than replacing traditional roles. The paper addresses education and training implications for the hotel sector and education providers by examining current curricula and training provision and questions the relevance of some \u201csacred cows\u201d that have traditionally been taught. The paper concludes with recommendations for future education and training provision.\nOriginal languageEnglish\nPages (from-to)93-109\nNumber of pages17\nJournalJournal of Quality Assurance in Hospitality and Tourism\nIssue number3-4\nPublication statusPublished - 2002\n\n\n  \u2022 Benchmarking\n  \u2022 personnel selection criteria\n  \u2022 training\n  \u2022 front office\n  \u2022 technology\n\nFingerprint Dive into the research topics of 'Benchmarking best practice in hotel front office: the Western European experience'.

Little is known of the socio-economic contribution of these parks to their respective local economies. The purpose of this research was to determine the socio-economic impact of the Karoo National Park (Karoo NP) in South Africa, especially the economic impact of the Karoo NP on the local economy, the impact of tourism business development in the Karoo district, and how the park affects the community. Three surveys were used to determine the socio-economic impact: a community survey, a business survey and a tourist survey. The results show that the park has an impact in terms of production, income generation and employment in the area, but this impact is not as significant as that of other national parks in South Africa. A small percentage (4%) of businesses in Beaufort West owe their existence to the Karoo NP, but most rely on tourist spending. For the park to have a greater impact, it is imperative to increase accommodation capacity, offer more activities and promote activities and attractions in the region.\nCONSERVATION IMPLICATION:The importance of this article lies in the economic value that conservation management generates as well as identifying the benefits that communities derive from the existence of a national park. It also supports the notion that conservation entails more than just conserving fauna and flora and highlights the interdependence of conservation, tourism and community participation.\n\nKeywords: SANParks; South Africa; tourism; economic value; community perceptions\n\n\n\n\nNational parks in South Africa have three fundamental spheres: firstly, to conserve the biodiversity of the country; secondly, to maintain a relationship of community upliftment and capacity building with people living in the areas in and around the parks; and, lastly, to provide a recreational outlet for people to experience and enjoy the wonders of the parks (Saayman & Saayman 2006a).\n\nWhile the main emphasis of national parks has traditionally been on conservation, there has been a shift towards economic sustainability and the upliftment of local communities (Myburgh & Saayman 2002). It is the latter that provides the rationale for this research and, although South Africa has some of the greatest protected areas in the world, little is known about the socio-economic impact of these parks.\n\nSocio-economics is the study of the relationship between economic activity and social life (Van der Merwe 2008). The goal of a socio-economic study is generally to assess socio-economic development, usually in terms of improvements in metrics such as gross domestic product (GDP), life expectancy, literacy and levels of employment (Van der Merwe 2008), with the aim of enhancing the benefits received by the society. A socio-economic impact study therefore goes beyond assessing income generated by the park, and also involves the contribution of the park to the quality of life of the community (Saayman & Saayman 2006a).\n\nEadington and Redman (1991, cited by Walpole & Goodwin 2000) state that tourism, as a development tool, holds many potential economic benefits for host communities, including increased employment opportunities, improved socio-economic conditions and greater market stability than are provided by traditional commodity exports. The magnitude of the economic benefits is dependent on the amount that remains in the area. Adding to this, Saayman and Saayman (2004) express their concern about leakages, both in the form of imported goods and imported skills, which will reduce the benefit for the local community because most national parks are situated in rural areas.\n\nPage (2007) identified four economic benefits of tourism, namely the generation of income for the local community; the creation of new employment opportunities; improvements to the structure and balance of economic activities in the locality; and the encouragement of entrepreneurial activity. The attitudes of residents towards tourism represent an important way in which participants contribute to policy and public support for, or dissent towards, tourism (Page 2007).\n\nStudies that were conducted on socio-economic and economic impacts include those of Loader (1994) and Pelser (2003), who argue that social involvement is an integral part of conservation in South Africa. Macleod (2001) and Fauzi and Buchary (2002) suggest that the alleviation of poverty and marginality in the case of residents of the Kepulauan Seribu Marine Park, Del Este in the Dominican Republic, should receive priority, and that park management should be based on consensus building and participation by all stakeholders. Therefore, the community should play an important role in maximising the local socio-economic benefits (Govender et al. 2005). An example of how the local community has focused efforts on maximising benefits from tourism activity as the result of a national park can be found in Mpumalanga Province. There, towns adjacent to the Kruger National Park have started to focus on offering additional tourism products, which contribute to income and employment and thereby increase the impact of the Park in the region (Saayman & Saayman 2006b).\n\nThe Karoo National Park (Karoo NP) is located in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, on the outskirts of the town of Beaufort West, and can be accessed via the N1 highway. The Karoo NP serves mainly as an overnight park for visitors and tourists en route from or to the Western Cape\/Gauteng Province (Figure 1). During the late 1950s, Mr William Quinton, a local farmer and keen birdwatcher, began campaigning to have a conservation area declared in the vicinity of Beaufort West. In the 1970s, the South African National Parks Board put forward plans to establish a national park that would be representative of the Karoo Biome. After considering a number of potential suitable areas, it was decided that this new park would be established in the vicinity of Beaufort West (South African National Parks 2007). The Town Council of Beaufort West donated 7 209 ha of vacant communal land northwest of the town to the South African National Parks Board (currently known as SANParks). This formed the nucleus of the Karoo NP, proclaimed in 1979. Since then, additional land purchases have increased the Karoo NP to its present size of approximately 96 000 ha (South African National Parks 2007).\n\n\n\nThe aim of this research was to estimate the socio-economic contribution of the Karoo NP to the surrounding communities, with an additional focus on the community's involvement in the Karoo NP, guided by the following questions:\n\n\u2022 What is the economic impact of the Karoo NP on the local economy?\n\n\u2022 What percentage of business development in the region is as a result of the park?\n\n\u2022 How many people are employed as a result of tourism activity due to the Karoo NP?\n\n\u2022 How satisfied is the community with regard to the Karoo NP?\n\n\n\nSaayman & Saayman (2006a) created a framework to assess the socio-economic impact of national parks in South Africa (see Figure 2). They identified five issues of importance when assessing the socio-economic impacts of parks. Firstly, there must be an understanding of the area and the main economic activities in the area \u2013 the spatial area must therefore be specified and all the communities in the specified area should be included in the research. Secondly, the magnitude of visitor spending and the distribution of the spending throughout the local economy should be determined. This could be done via visitor (demand) and business (supply) surveys, especially in local areas, where business and spending information is not readily available. Thirdly, and if possible, these should be complemented by a community survey. Fourthly, the spending by the national park on employees and local products should be included to obtain a complete picture of spending activities resulting from the existence of the park. Fifthly, the social impact of the park on the community must be determined. In areas where no local input-output model is available (which is usually the case), a proportional multiplier analysis could be used to determine the values of the income and sales multipliers, and to estimate the economic impact of the national park on income and employment. Finally, the change in the nature of business and employment opportunities in the area due to the national park should be determined by comparing it to previous business surveys of the area (Saayman & Saayman 2006a).\n\n\n\nBased on the above, three surveys were conducted: a community survey, a business survey in Beaufort West and a visitor survey of tourists visiting the Karoo NP. Secondly, a partial input-output model was developed to estimate partial multipliers and thus the economic impact of the Karoo NP. In general, multipliers indicate the magnitude of economic benefits in terms of sales, income and employment generated by the initial spending in the economy due to the tourism activity. Input-output models are often used to generate these multipliers. Yet regional input-output tables are often not available (als... (truncated)",

Tourism provides all transportation system, services, recreational facilities, accommodations, consumer products and specialized services. Indonesia has a lot of tourism destinations where it is important for the economy to gain income sources, create employment and economy development. First, tourism could gain income sources. Indonesia, as a developing country, makes tourism as the main income for the economy. Indonesia is rich of their traditions, culture and the nature beauty. These are all the major things that attract tourist to come and visit Indonesia. The more tourists come to Indonesia, the more income that government will get. To conclude, this will increase the economy. Second, create a lot of needed employment. There is more job field opened related to tourism industry. This will increase the number of employment and decrease the joblessness in Indonesia. Tourist will be more confident to visit Indonesia where the decreasing of joblessness would create less crime in the country. In conclusion, higher safety will materialize. Third, it\u2019s an opportunity for economy development. Association for Indonesia\u2019s tourism always create something new to attract more tourist to come and more destinations opened up. Many of tourists are from out of Asia\/overseas where they have bigger currency of money than Rupiah (Indonesia\u2019s money). To conclude, tourism Indonesia had develop economy in Indonesia where Bali is being the most tourist destination. In conclusion, tourism industry has become an important key role for Indonesia\u2019s economy where income sourced is gained, create job field to increase the number of employment and for economy development. All people should keep and preserve all the nature wealth to attract more tourists to come and develop Indonesia\u2019s economy itself.\ntracking img",

Having so many parks in such a small amount of space gives us a variety of amusement choices. Here we have theme parks, water parks, and animal parks, guaranteeing that there will be something to cater to your interests. The most popular of all the Central Florida attractions are the theme parks. These are most appealing to the children, who usually have the final say in the selection process, mainly because they are geared toward younger kids. That's why they have the popular characters, and the child oriented themes. But these parks are also very entertaining for adults with the big roller coasters, live shows, and other attractions. Theme parks have a little bit if everything, making it possible for everyone for to have a good time. That's why they are usually the best bet for the whole family. People come from all over the world, just to visit the theme parks. Theme parks are perfect for vacations. Another extremely popular attraction of Central Florida are the numerous water parks. In an area known for it's hot, humid weather, these fit in perfectly. A nice water ride will cool you off pretty quick on a warm, summer day. That's why water parks are most popular with the people from this area. We appreciate them the most because we live with this weather every day. These parks are like a mini \u0091oasis.' Vacationers often visit water parks, but are usually not the main attraction for their trip. But they do make a great addition to one. They may see a flier for one in their hotel and decide to go cool of. Water parks bring us all the relaxation and sun of our famous beaches, but also give us many entertaining rides, wave pools, and other water attractions.

Spending the annual holiday away from Saudi is normal for most Saudi\\ud families and it is estimated that the total expenditure on domestic tourism in Saudi\\ud Arabia is only 16.7% of total tourism expenditure. International expenditure was\\ud estimated (in 1995) to be US$ 7.6 million US$ and this increased to more than US$\\ud 8.2 million in 1997 which is about 17.3% of total oil revenue estimated in 1998 and\\ud nearly 5.6% of the Saudi gross domestic product. Consequently, foreign tourism is a\\ud substantial drain on the current account, so the government has been trying to\\ud persuade more of its citizens to holiday at home. This situation will require tourism\\ud marketer to understand fully the need of tourists. Under increasingly competitive\\ud conditions, effective tourism marketing is impossible with out an understanding of\\ud tourists' motivation to choose a Saudi travel destination.\\ud \\ud \\ud The purpose of this study is to describe and analyse the status of domestic tourism\\ud motivation. The research took place in Saudi Arabia, concentrating on the motivation\\ud 'push' and 'pull' factors of tourist behaviour towards domestic tourism in an Islamic\\ud and Arabic culture.\\ud \\ud \\ud Data were collected by means of a questionnaire using a 5-point Likert-scale. Out of\\ud 1400 questionnaires distributed, in two tourism cities Jeddah and Abha, 505 usable\\ud questionnaires were verified and prepared for the final analysis. In view of the\\ud intensive and extensive data and interdependent relationships between variables, the\\ud statistical techniques used in this research include reliability analysis, frequencies,\\ud cross tabulation, mean, standard deviation, chi-square, factor analysis, Pearson\\ud correlation, multiple regression and one-way ANOVA.\\ud \\ud \\ud The results of the analysis of push motivation indicates nine factors: (Fl) cultural\\ud value factor; (F2) utilitarian factor; (F3) knowledge factor; (F4) social factor; (F5)\\ud economical factor; (F6) family togetherness factor; (F7) interest factor; (F8)\\ud relaxation factor; (F9) convenience of facilities factor.\\ud \\ud The result of the factor loading for pull motivational items presents nine pull factors:\\ud (Fl) safety factor; (F2) activity factor; (F3) beach sports\/activities factor; (F4)\\ud nature\/outdoor factor; (F5) historical\/cultural factor; (F6) religious factor; (F7) budget\\ud factor; (F8) leisure factor; (F9) upscale factor. This study found that the most\\ud important push and pull factors as perceived by Saudi tourists are 'cultural value' and\\ud 'religious'.\\ud \\ud \\ud The major findings of the study were that the push factors positively and strongly\\ud related to pull factors. Also, the study found that no significant correlation existed\\ud between push and pull motivation items and the social demographic variables,\\ud educational level, income level and age. The only significant correlation was found\\ud between pull motivation items and the gender.\\ud \\ud \\ud In the case of the push factors the test found that there is no significant correlation\\ud between push motivation factors and the educational level, with one exception, a\\ud significant correlation between social factor and the educational level in Abha. The\\ud study found that there are significant correlations between the economical push\\ud motivation factor and the income level, while the remaining eight factors are not\\ud significantly correlated with the income level in Jeddah. Also, there is a significant\\ud correlation between the knowledge factor and the income level in Abha.\\ud \\ud \\ud The results indicate that there is significant correlation between push motivation\\ud factors and age as follow: cultural value factor and age in Jeddah, interest factor and\\ud age in Abha and social factor and age in Abha.\\ud \\ud \\ud The study found that there is significant correlation between push motivation factors\\ud and the gender. A significant correlation is found between the interest factor, social\\ud factor and the gender in Jeddah. In addition, a significant correlation is found between\\ud the interests, the cultural value, the utilitarian factors and the gender in Abha.\\ud \\ud \\ud Relating to pull factors, the results indicate that there is no significance correlation\\ud between pull motivation factors and the educational level with the exception of a\\ud significant correlation between the upscale factor and the educational level in Jeddah,\\ud and a significant correlation between the activity factor and the educational level in\\ud Abha. A significance correlation exists between the upscale factor and the income\\ud level in both Jeddah and Abha.\\ud \\ud There is no significant correlation between pull motivation factors and age in Jeddah.\\ud However, there is significant correlation between the activity factor, the beach sports\\ud activities factor, the upscale factor and age in Abha. There is no significance\\ud correlation between pull motivation factors and gender in Jeddah, except the activity\\ud factor. In Abha there is significant correlation between the nature\/outdoor factor, the\\ud activity factor, the safety factor and gender.\\ud \\ud \\ud The results indicate that educational and income level have no significant correlation\\ud with the kind of accommodation, while tourist age and the length of tourist stay have\\ud significant and strong correlation with the kind of accommodation. In respect of the\\ud family number and the kind of accommodation the result shows that there is a\\ud significant correlation between the kind of accommodation and the number of adults\\ud and number of children under 11 years group. The study indicates that there is no\\ud correlation between the kind of accommodation and the number of children in the 11-\\ud 16 years group.\\ud \\ud \\ud The complex interdependent relationships mean that providers of tourist facilities\\ud have to have a deep understanding of the motivation of potential markets to provide\\ud the required facilities and activities\n\nTopics: GV, DS\nOAI identifier: oai:eprints.hud.ac.uk:4664\n\nSuggested articles\n\n\n\n  1.

The first part of the article describes the four models of family decision-making and identifies the determinants of making joint and individual decisions. The second part discusses the profiling of a tourist whose tourist-trip-related family decisions are made jointly and of a tourist whose decisions in this respect are dominated by the family member whose income is the highest. Moreover, the areas of tourist decisions were recognised showing that decisions made by families with dependent children were on the one hand similar whilst on the other different from those made by childless families. Similar analysis was conducted among the families with dependent children who play the role of initiator, advisor and decision-maker in terms of organizing a tourist trip and among those families where children do not play such roles.

The\u00a0tourism\u00a0industry, effortlessly tries to create a blend of leisure, ensure enjoyment and also provide a support system. Due to the emerging tourism industry in a far fetched places, it has brought wealth to remote rural communities, and also provided support during the financial crashes, ensured to provide endangered species and restored crumbling historic cities. Tourism's potential benefits are clear. However, the mistake is to think that it can only bring good. Many of us do not believe this myth and have been speaking out against it for decades. Our concerns were dismissed, until very recently. In summer 2017, the media and the travel industry finally began to turn their gaze to the negative impacts of the holiday industry, and the term 'over-tourism\u2019 was coined. Overtourism is a phenomenon wherein primarily due to the excessive advertisement of a destination, we witness a huge number of tourists visiting and thus outing extra pressure on limited resources and also adding to chaos and problems faced by all including locals and visitors and administrators. Due to over-tourism, there is also a problem of waste pile up in the tourist destination and other pollution as well.\n\nRelevant Theory and models\n\nAlthough the problem of over-tourism is new, the devastation caused by it is humongous and thus the authorities and planners need to take swift action to control the same else the impact could be devastating. \u00a0As per the \u201cSustainable-Responsible Tourism\u201d, it could not be foolproof control or solution, planners could determine the number of visitors touring every day at a specified location (Milano, 2019). This approach would control the situation on an immediate basis but could have a ripple effect as well as it would lead to the gradual decrease in visitors and revenue in that area and thus this requires careful planning and thinking and should be applied to few locations.\u00a0\n\nSource (Oklevik, 2019)\n\nsustainable responsible tourism\n\nAs per the \u201cNew Tourism Phenomena\u201d \u00a0theory, the approach could be of dispersal approach wherein the administrators need to develop certain other lesser-known locations wherein the tourists can go and thus there would be lesser footfall in a certain location at a particular point of time and thus saving chaos and pressure on resources and would also help in minimizing the pollution levels. Such an approach is a better approach s visitors get to know of different off locations and planners get more revenue as spending increases and new venus gets ready as well. This approach augurs well as it is tourists friendly and adds up to the economy and leads to the development of newer locations. By this approach, tourists are dispersed and there is a lesser load on limited resources. This approach has a shortcoming and is not as easy as it sounds. It is to be taken into account that all alternate locations cannot handle tourists pressure and there could be chaos if there are over-tourism in such alternate locations and things could become difficult as those locations would not be equipped to handle such heavy footfall and would not have adequate resources to take care of all. Thus this approach requires careful and thoughtful planning.\n\nSpace planning is another approach that needs a thought beforehand and this requires a thought that what is the number of hotels and restaurants available to arrange for a stay of tourists. It also requires a thought on medical facilities in case of any medical emergency, planners should understand the contours of the destination as places up the hill would have a delay in arranging resources or would face difficulty or crisis in arraign supplies or alternatives and thus here could be a panic amongst tourists in case of any mishap thus leading to misfortunes of the destination. \u00a0Due to recent global warming, there are hours of traffic jams in hilly areas in summers due to excessive tourists' footfall and also there is the crisis of potable water and thus all these basics require careful planning and alternate arrangements(Oklevik, 2019).\n\nResource planning is of utmost importance as a tourist or guest omes to a destination to relax and enjoys and to have some fond memories. In case resource planning is not done, they could have a horrid time and bad memories thus leading to a downfall in tourism and economy. It is to be understood that tourism is a global phenomenon and certain economies or countries have tourism as the biggest contributor to their economies hence all these factors need careful and thoughtful planning.\u00a0\n\nStakeholders can help to address the over-tourism problem\n\nDodds, 2019 has mentioned the\u00a0tourism is a global phenomenon and contributes as a big revenue source to any country, the planners and administrators need to address the concern of over-tourism in an organized manner and keep reviewing the situations at regular intervals. Stakeholders not only include planners but also travel planners, local shopkeepers, guides and of course the tourists. One should think of sustainable tourism methods and thus stop dumping wastes in a destination. All should wor to have a pleasant and relaxed stay and thus should keep traffic coming in and pollution under check at all times. Also, it is important to have sufficient supplies of consumables and better medical facilities as visitors could also transmit an epidemic.\u00a0Goodwin, 2017 has mentioned, how over-tourism\u00a0at least, there should always be backup of everything planned at all times and there should be a backup and disaster recovery plans ready and awareness levels should be high for the local people to act and help in case of any contingency. Also, vehicles carrying a huge number of tourists like cruise\/ships need to be more cognizant of sea pollution caused by them. Packaged tour planners should work in sync to avoid heavy traffic and chaos and understand that it is in their interest as well to have the destination well maintained and also this would give rise to newer destinations where traffic could be diverted to.\u00a0\n\nKoens, 2018 has mentioned how the\u00a0town planners also need to understand the demographic changes and keep certain areas as reserves and standby in case they need to develop other destinations so it could be done in a planned manner. \u00a0Also, they should note that various modern-day ailments are caused by visitors these days which are epidemic in nature and thus they need to understand that safety of all human beings and nature and historic sites are of utmost importance and they should have proper resources and staff to take care of them and should have proper measures to understand the condition of uncontrolled tourism and its havoc to their land and thus plan better and ensure the safety of geology at all times (S\u00e9raphin, 2019)\n\nTo keep revenues flowing from tourism, there is a need for sustainable growth and development of resources and a monitoring system needs to be in place to control the footfall and its impact on resources (Peeters, 2018). \u00a0Milano, 2018, has mentioned how\u00a0we have surged in pollution worldwide and with an increase in spending, we witness a trend of global tourism which is a great source of revenue for a nation and locals and thus needs to be promoted as well. We have outlined various approached to control over-tourism and such measures need to judicious planning and execution and review after a prefixed timeline to assess its relevance. Also, for a destination to have sufficient resources, hotels, medical facilities, and most important backup or all sorts of contingencies at all times to be considered and remembered as the favorite place of destination wherein a tourist would come again and would have fond memories back home.\n\n\nAs we all know that excess of everything is bad tourism is a wonderful event for any country and the ts economy and also for visitors and local people and thus we see a surge in global tourism across. However, due to increase in advertisements, package tours and global trend of vacationing and exploring new places, there is new phenomena or problem of over-tourism which technically tantamount to excessive tourists visiting a destination so much so that particular destination or its natural resources cannot hold or handle such massive visitors and thus adding to the pressure of economy its resources. Also, it is to be noted that such excessive tourism comes at a cost of depletion or erosion of natural resources and an increase in pollution levels. Be it increased awareness of no dumping of plastic in sea or water or thrust on recycling and reuse theory, depletion of resources is bound to happen in such scenarios. Thus there is a need for planned tourism across and governments, planners need to sort such issues and if required, restrict the number of tourists or restrict the issuance of visas during a particular period of destination. It is to be noted that natural beauty restoration needs to be of prime importance as it is the only source that could bring additional visitors and is required to maintain balance in ecology.",
