Are you able to address this topic outside of the political rhetoric that you listen to? Does the Bible inform you or CNN or FoxNews?\u00a0\n  2. Pastor Keith said that we often mishandle power in our brokenness. What power has God given you that you can use to serve others? In what way are you tempted to use your power for you?\n  3. Pastor Keith suggested that we listen before we talk. I am reading a couple of books that make me uncomfortable. I am learning. I am reading \u201cWhite Awake\u201d written by a white Christian Pastor. It is his journey of understanding God\u2019s heart for a New Humanity and the struggle to see his own prejudice. From another (opposing) point of view, I am reading Thomas Sowell\u2019s book \u201cIntellectuals and Race\u201d. He is an African American economist and social theorist who advocates for an understanding of racial inequities along social and economic lines rather than ethnic identity wars that have been made commonplace by intellectual elites. My suggestion: turn off CNN and FoxNews and read for yourself. So, the question: what are you learning?\u00a0\n  4. Lastly, let\u2019s pray together.\u00a0\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.\n\n%d bloggers like this:",

        "text":"First Confession Advice\n\nby Jimmy Akin\n\nin Sacraments\n\nA reader writes:\n\nMy husband is in RCIA, and he thinks he has to be in the Confessional for 6 hours, relaying every horrid thing he ever did in his childhood, like the one time he killed a bird out of meanness, and all those times he didn\u2019t keep holy the Sabbath growing up, etc.\n\nOkay, just to make sure you know: Your husband doesn\u2019t need to confess anything from before he was baptized. Baptism wipes out all sins prior to it, so if he wasn\u2019t baptized until sometime after he was an infant then he doesn\u2019t need to worry about that chunk of his life.\n\nAnd he keeps asking me for an example of a venial sin. Believe it or not, I can\u2019t think of an example.\n\nWell, killing a bird out of meanness and not keeping the Sabbath holy as a non-Catholic strike me as two good examples.\n\nKilling a human is a grave sin, but killing an animal is not\u2013unless by killing it you somehow gravely damage a human being (e.g., by killing the horse of a man who needs the horse to earn his livelihood or killing a very expensive purebred pet or something).\n\nSimilarly, non-Catholics are not obliged by canon law to attend Mass or to refrain from servile labor on Sundays. Their obligations for Sunday observance are much more general and, not being bound by a specific standard, they generally do not sin mortally if they fail to go to church or otherwise observe Sundays. This is especially so for those raised in households where Sunday observance was very lax.\n\nSecond, our pastor and instructor, whom I love and respect, kind of laughed and said, \"I\u2019ve been a priest for 35 years and I haven\u2019t yet met someone who\u2019s broken all ten Commandments.\"\n\nI was thinking to myself, \"Oh, yes you have. You\u2019ve met me.\"\n\nFurther, my husband has also broken all ten. All one has to do is read one of those Examination of Conscience books to figure out that most people have broken all ten.\n\nTrue, but you have to realize that the things listed in an examination of conscience aren\u2019t all mortal sins. For example: \"Have I stolen the property of another?\" is only mortal if you gravely harm the person from whom your steal. If you take a box of pens home from work then that\u2019s going to be venial (unless for some really weird reason the existence of your place of employment hinges on its having that box of pens or something).\n\nIf you steal a thousand bucks from work, though, that\u2019s going to be mortal since that thousand dollars represents a thousand dollars of damage that was done to some person or persons (like your fellow employees) who would otherwise have it (the loss of a thousand bucks being a serious matter for anyone who isn\u2019t very wealthy).\n\nMy husband was raised in a single parent home where religion was not a priority. I asked him the other day, \"When you (stole the candy, killed the bird, missed Church) did you know it was a sin?\" He replied that he knew in his heart those things were bad, even if he didn\u2019t know they were \u2018sins\u2019. So, does he have to confess them?\n\nThe fact that he couldn\u2019t articulate the word \"sin\" in connection with them doesn\u2019t of itself mean that he\u2019s off the hook, because he still knew they were wrong and did them anyway. But the fact that he was raised in this kind of religiously lax family (in the case of missing church) and that he\u2019s talking about very small things (stealing candy, killing a bird) mean that the grave matter needed for mortal sin is not there.\n\nAm I going to be an old woman before my husband emerges from the Confessional?\n\nThat would depend on whether there is a mini-black hole or other extreme gravitational force in the confessional that could warp spacetime while your husband is making his confession.\n\nI mean, we\u2019re trying to have kids, for crying out loud.\n\nGood luck with that! We need more kids around!\n\nCan you, at your leisure, please explain \u2018First Confession: What to Say, What not to Say\"?\n\nIn a post I did earlier today (by a strange coincidence), I talked about how the process of making a confession generally works, and I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll give your husband additional guidance in his RCIA course.\n\nI would say this, though: It is clear that your husband is currently suffering from a case of confessional scrupulosity, by which I mean that he\u2019s overestimating what sins he needs to confess. This is a normal thing in persons just coming into the Church, because he hasn\u2019t yet had a chance to learn what does and does not need to be confessed. As he learns more, this tendency should go away.\n\nA standard piece of advice for people who have scrupulosity is that they are to confess ONLY those sins which they are CERTAIN were mortal sins and to refrain from confessing everything else, simply saying \"And for all my sins I am sorry.\"\n\nI would therefore look through the Ten Commandments, with a knowledge of the different ways one can offend against them, and say, \"Can I remember any cases where I KNOW that I GRAVELY offended against one of these DELIBERATELY and KNOWING that it was a grave violation at the time?\"\n\nSince he was raised in a religiously lax family, he likely did not know that many of the sins he may have committed in his life were grave violations, even if they were.\n\nMaking this kind of confession will suffice. As long as he doesn\u2019t deliberately hold back something that he KNOWS to be a mortal sin then the absolution will be valid, and if he later comes to the conclusion that something he failed to mention was mortal then he can confess it at that time.\n\nI\u2019d also be patient with him. First confessions of adult converts can often take a while. I think that my first one lasted for something like 45 minutes (though that may be a bad memory and it may have been considerably less). It took so long not because I had that many mortal sins to confess, but because I was new to confession and was in the same situation as your husband.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to confess and I wasn\u2019t efficient at it, so I went into too much detail and confessed all kinds of things I didn\u2019t know to be mortal, just to be sure. I didn\u2019t know, for example, that I could just say \"I have THIS to confess and THAT to confess\" and move through things swiftly. Today the same initial confession would take me five minutes\u2013ten tops, depending on any questions the priest wanted to ask me.\n\nAlso, if it is going to take a long time, you can simply stay home while your husband does it. He also might want to make a special appointment for it rather than making other people wait in line during a really long confession.\n\nOne thing that might help your husband get through it would be to write out a list of what he needs to confess. If he does this, he should do it BY HAND (NOT on a computer, where there could be an electronic record of it created accidentally or by spyware).\n\nIf he thinks he may be overcome by emotion, he can also hand the list to the priest and say \"I confess THIS.\" If he does that, he should afterwards get the list back from the priest and DESTROY it (tearing it into little bits and flushing it down the nearest men\u2019s room toilet would be a good way).\n\nMeasures such as these should allow him to get through the confession more quickly and get back to your marriage . . . already in progress.\n\n\n\nIf you liked this post, you should join Jimmy's Secret Information Club to get more great info!\n\nWhat is the Secret Information Club?I value your email privacy\n\n\nDenise Downing February 27, 2006 at 12:44 pm\n\nIs you have been through your First Reconciliation (as an adult convert), confessed mortal and venial sins as best as you can remember, are not all your sins absolved then? This is what I have been taught, but if that is not so, then guess I better go back through the list of mortal\/venial sins and see what else I can remember.. don\u2019t want to end up in hell over something I simply forgot to mention\u2026\nOr am I totally wrong in this?\n\nBillyHW February 27, 2006 at 12:49 pm\n\nIf he thinks he may be overcome by emotion, he can also hand the list to the priest and say \u201cI confess THIS.\u201d\nI had no idea you could do that.\nIf he does that, he should afterwards get the list back from the priest and DESTROY it (tearing it into little bits and flushing it down the nearest men\u2019s room toilet would be a good way).\nSo that\u2019s why the church toilet never works right.\n\nCathy Ward February 27, 2006 at 1:24 pm\n\nThat\u2019s great advice.\nI also had no idea one could write their sins down, so as to avoid being overcome by emotion.\nExcellent post!\n\nBreier February 27, 2006 at 1:44 pm\n\nJimmy can correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I believe his advice applies to situations where would LOSE YOUR POWER OF SPEECH because of severe emotion. The mere feeling of shame or tears of contrition (which are a gift of God) are not a sufficient reason to write your sins down and had them over.\nFor a concrete example, the written list of sins is used to make an ORAL and AUDIBLE confession of one\u2019s sins. If you become too choked up and can\u2019t continue, then you could hand the list over.\nBut he\u2019s not saying that you can generally just write your sins out instead of confessing them orally. Writing them out is an aid to memory for an oral confession.\nBut clarification on Mr. Akin\u2019s views would be appreciated!\n\nTheocoid February 27, 2006 at 3:45 pm\n\nWhen I was in RCIA as a revert (they didn\u2019t have a program for returning Catholics at that church), they encouraged us to attend a reconciliation service. Now this wasn\u2019t simply a communal penance service. There were many priests, and each person was supposed to go up to one and whisper their sins to the priest in the presence of everyone else. Needless to say, the context didn\u2019t encourage anything more but a general recitation of sins by category.\nI went to reconciliation one on one a few weeks later to make sure I dotted my T\u2019s and crossed my I\u2019s. I\u2019ve also recounted a few incidents about which I have felt a great deal of guilt in separate sessions. So I think that first general reconciliation set me up (as one with some... (truncated)",

        "text":"According to evolution science, all life on earth started as a bunch of molecules that accidentally coalesced in a lifeless puddle of mud to form a complex little biological machine that we call a cell. All forms of life then evolved for this first cell, through a process that is completely mindless, blind and purposeless.\n\nIt can argued that some forms of morality are a result of evolution, since they provide a survival advantage to the species. But there are many other moral decisions that make no sense at all from an evolutionary point of view. For example, nothing is more antithetical to the propagation of the species than homosexuality, so how does supporting same-sex marriage provide a survival benefit to the species? Reproduction is rather important to survival, so how does abortion provide an advantage? How does caring for the elderly increase the species' chance of survival?\n\nFurthermore, it can be argued from evolution science that:\n1. Humans beings are as meaningless as the process (evolution) that produced them ;\n2. Humans beings are just one species amoung millions of other different species of biomachines that evolution mindlessly produced, so humans are no more important or meaningful than a virus, a cockroach or a rat;\n3. Humans are really just machines made from rearranged mud, so a human with morals is as meaningless as mud with morals.\n4. When a human dies, he is demoted from being glorified mud to being just ordinary mud.\n\nIn light of the above facts (at least, according to evolution science), why should any human being bother with something as ultimately meaningless as morality? If the human race became extinct, the universe wouldn't even notice. And the universe, which is mindless and meaningless, doesn't care if you live your life as a monster or as a saint. You can live like Ted Bundy or Mother Theresa; it doesn't matter, since everything is meaningless.\n\nAll codes of morality can be ignored, since we are mud, and to mud we shall return.\n\nViews: 379\n\nReplies to This Discussion\n\n\"As for morality, it has nothing to do with the above in any way shape or form.\n\nIt seems to me that what Anthony Blair is stating is the religious position that if you don't believe God made the living world, you believe evolution made it, and I think this does have real and central implications for morality.\u00a0 If evolution made us, then there is no central governing force, in the religious sense.\u00a0 This matters in theory, and also in practice as it used to be religion that governed society.\u00a0\n\nWhen religion governed our morals, before there was an effective police force, society was in relative chaos.\u00a0 (In the UK at least.)\u00a0 Probably a combination of the two is the most effective way to go.\u00a0 For example, religion emphasises the need to behave oneself even when nobody is watching.\u00a0 On the other hand, this also comes from a secular \"love of goodness and the effects of good behaviour\" and the idea that \"no good comes from no good\" - a love of virtue for its own sake.\u00a0\n\n\"when you compare the religions of the prison population, against the general population, you find religious people are extremely over represented...\n\n- surely this is largely because people \"find God\" in prison, as a way to put their lives on the right track.\u00a0\n\nOr it's\u00a0just to bullshit the parole boards\n\nPrisoners DO pretend to \"find god\" because they DO think it will go over better with parole boards, etc...but, what they \"find\" is almost always whatever god they say they had all along, they just pretend its more meaningful to them NOW, because they had a vision\/felt his presence\/realized the error of their ways, etc.\n\nThat doesn't mean however that ALL of them were atheists.\u00a0 In fact, statistically, about none were atheists...they were practicing whatever they were raised with, and, committed crimes anyway...even though they believed in god.\n\nArch-typically, they assumed they would go to hell...and, the idea of \"being saved\", was a \"get out of purgatory for free card\"...and they find that attractive for obvious reasons.\n\nSo, the parole boards are quite aware of the BS, and ignore it for the most part, as everything most of these inmates says is assumed to be a lie as the default anyway.\n\nThe boards mostly look at actions not words.\u00a0 IE: Did they keep their noses clean when in, or were they dealing or fighting, they have a written job offer, family who signed off that they'd take them in, etc.\n\nMost inmates, if asked why they committed the crimes that landed them there, respond \"I didn't think I'd get caught\".\n\nThe Judaeo-Christian morality taught them that being good for its own sake was not the issue, and that being good to go to heaven, and to not be bad to avoid hell WAS the issue.\n\nSo, rewards and punishment for behavior from third party monitoring so to speak.\n\nThat has a statistical and historical tendency for those raised that way to assume, bizarrely, that people would commit a crime if they thought they would get away with it.\n\nIE: No God = Kill people if you won't get caught, etc.\n\nWhen an atheist, etc, says, wait, I would not commit the perfect murder even if I could, because it would cause pain to the family and friends of the victim, etc...and they know how that might feel, and, that it would be a bad thing to do, and, it would feel bad to do it, etc.\n\nPeople KNEW it was bad to kill or steal way before bibles or stone tablets distributed by burning shrubberies, etc.\n\nWhen codifying morals, they didn't invent the morals, they just wrote what they thought at the time morals should consist of, based upon the conditions at the time.\n\nPeople invented morals for themselves, and, those morals changed as the times changed.\n\nHow to treat a slave morphed into slavery being a moral person who treated his slaves more humanely was a good person at the time, and, would be considered evil today...because he had slaves in the first place.\n\nRaping captured girls was normal...and not immoral, in biblical times.\u00a0 Now, capturing girls w\/o even raping them is considered immoral, and raping is not considered moral.\n\nBEING raped was considered immoral, and as having disgraced her family...and still is in parts of the world...but the rapist was considered to sort of be along the lines of \"Boys will be Boys...\" etc.\n\nThat too is slowly changing.\n\nAnd so forth.\u00a0 We make our own morality.\u00a0 That means \"Anything goes, and you might as well kill and rape and steal because there's no god to punish you for it\" those raised to not be good because its right, but only to avoid punishment.\n\nTo the rest of mankind, raised to be good because it is right, it means \"We have collectively decided that the following is wrong\".\n\nSo, the prisoners who were Christians from birth are there mostly because they have poor judgement and a poor sense of consequence...hence risking Hell...and not having empathy for their victims, and being raised to think that if there was no god, or way to get caught, they SHOULD commit the \"perfect crime\".\n\nEssentially, the over arching mindset is along the lines of, after they commit the first crime\/bad deed...\"Well I'm going to hell anyway, so fuck it...I can do whatever I want to now because I'm already fucked\".\n\nInstead of seeing each opportunity to be good, or bad, as a free standing choice unconnected to what came before.\n\n\"The Judaeo-Christian morality taught them that being good for its own sake was not the issue, and that being good to go to heaven, and to not be bad to avoid hell WAS the issue.\n\n- somehow, I think it teaches both, or perhaps they are related.\u00a0 If I displease God, He may forgive me instead of sending me to hell.\u00a0 But I just don't want to displease God, so I will behave myself even if nobody (apart from God) is looking.\u00a0\n\nI certainly find with the Christians that I usually meet that they are sincere in being good for its own sake.\u00a0\n\nIt's interesting that Michael Tomasello has found that humans are far more interested in how they are seen by others than are chimpanzees.\u00a0 From this paper:\u00a0 \"Five-Year Olds, but Not Chimpanzees, Attempt to Manage Their Reputations\" - Jan M. Engelmann, Esther Herrmann, Michael Tomasello, we see these results:\u00a0 I hope they are self-explanatory.\n\nStudy of 5 year-old children:\n\nStudy of chimpanzees:\n\nThe interesting question to ask is why do humans care so much more about their reputations than chimpanzees?\u00a0 I don't think it's just that we can talk, and therefore have reputations.\u00a0 I think it's also, ultimately, to do with interdependence - we are more valuable to each other than chimpanzees are to each other, because we cooperate more closely in order to survive.\u00a0\n\nAll morality is local. What is wrong varies from place to place. So, there really is no such thing as a morality, if by that you mean some universal fount of right and wrong. Sure, because we are human with human concerns and fears, you find some commonalities from place to place like \"don't kill people\" and \"don't steal\" and \"don't tell self-serving lies,\" but a lot of it is just local customs.\n\nAs far as I know, there are a lot of universals and there are local variations as well.\u00a0 I think the main difference between the West and the rest of the world (maybe you could say, the tribal world) is in the dimension of individual liberty and personhood versus respect for one's place within the rigid scheme of society.\u00a0 In the West, each person is an \"I\", in the \"old world\" each person is more of a \"we\".\u00a0\n\nThis dimension influences how the universals are played out.\u00a0\n\nI can go along with \"universal\" in a kind of statistical sense, but not if it implies a metaphysical level somehow dictating ethics.\n\n\nDiscussion Forum\n\nAll Morality is Relative\n\nStarted by Andrew Brown.

I too missed Katie&#39;s article. Given her engagement with Hutchison, I feel I must read it now! I&#39;d be curious to hear more though on the point about modernists not sharing theological beliefs or doctrines, but that they somehow had a &quot;shared understanding&quot; of religious belief and experience as an ongoing process. That needs a little unpacking for me. I&#39;m curious why no one has brought up Christopher White&#39;s excellent &quot;Unsettled Minds.&quot; The call for a more capacious understanding of &quot;liberal Protestant&quot; is part of his project, but his attempt to link the rise of liberal Christianity to personal experience (especially the desire for spiritual assurance in a cultural context where Calvinist parents and preachers emphasized this is a necessary aspect of attaining a deeply personal &quot;true religion&quot; is particularly illuminating. The turn to psychology to validate or explain stages of religious development, if I remember White correctly, was part of this broader effort at grounding religious experience in the verifiable or empirical. Perhaps one basic point is that &quot;liberal&quot; or modernist as a generic reference is not all that helpful unless it is placed in a specific historical moment and especially when it is used as a self-identifier or term of opprobrium (by critics) in heated moments of debates and cultural transition. That way of examining is clearly not sufficient, but one necessary part of a broader analysis.Curtis J Evansnoreply@blogger.comtag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37589721331585843.post-9307894209068722013-02-05T10:29:40.576-07:002013-02-05T10:29:40.576-07:00Thanks so much for this introduction to Lofton&#39...Thanks so much for this introduction to Lofton&#39;s article!<br \/><br \/>Personally, I&#39;m skeptical of old uses of the &quot;modernist&quot; label within the study of American Protestantism. It works well enough when the subject is (like Lofton&#39;s) the turn to &quot;empirical&quot; methods of inquiry. Really, it&#39;s the pragmatist method that was so thoroughly embraced by turn-of-the-century religious educators and seminarians. However, historians of liberal and mainline\/ecumenical Protestantism still have not come to terms with what David Bains has called the &quot;liturgical impulse&quot; in those churches. How do we square modernist methodology with the all-too-evident traditionalism of self-described twentieth-century &quot;Catholic Protestants&quot; or &quot;Evangelical Catholics&quot;?Mark T.

        "text":"Join Our Members List For Exclusive Reports\n\n\n    This is an excellent podcast by Tyla and Douglas Gabriel about the multidimensional aspects of the epochal change and the mass genocide that we are living through, drawing from Christian and Eastern theology and the work of Rudolf Steiner.\n\n    It\u2019s both extremely interesting and important to have a higher perspective of what\u2019s now happening, which is akin to the Great Flood of Noah. Whereas it said that Atlantis was destroyed by Water and the age previous to that, referred to as \u201cLemuria\u201d was destroyed by Fire, our current world is in the process of being destroyed via the Element of Air; through 5G, chemtrails, psychotronic warfare and the spread of bioweapons.\n\n    Douglas goes into a detailed description of Ahriman and Lucifer, which I won\u2019t get into here.\n\n    As Tyla says, \u201cWe\u2019re going through hyperinflation, the veils are being lifted, everything that can\u2019t be tied down to Earth has been shorted. The banks are short, the stock market is short, silver\u2019s short, all of the lies \u2013 everything \u2013 is being exposed and it\u2019s all going to collapse. But we\u2019re trying to nudge it so it collapses on the Evil Ones.\n\n    \u201cAnd those of you who\u2019ve been listening, paying attention, you\u2019re been fortifying yourselves, both spiritually and around you, physically with the things you need to survive as we go forward.\n\n    \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to paint a doomsday picture, because we know that those who\u2019ve prepared, we\u2019re going to be fine, we\u2019re going to make it out. But you\u2019re going to be on your Arc. You\u2019re going to see the people out there, in the water drowning and there\u2019s nothing you can do.\n\n    \u201cIf a loved-one has already taken the vaccine, you can\u2019t un-do that. So, we\u2019re just going to just have to come to grips with what this means for our future incarnations and our evolution as a species and stop looking at it as these individual losses, because there will be so much suffering, to have to watch this.\u201d\n\n    Douglas agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s like the image of Lot and his wife and children leaving the city, as hellfires [rain down].\u201d\n\n    Tyla continues, \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see so many Trump supporters, who are saying, \u2018Hell, no, we\u2019re not taking the vaccine and we don\u2019t care what Donald Trump says at his point. We don\u2019t see that he is free to speak the truth. He could be handled. His kids could be in a hostage situation, he could be threatened to have to come out and say these things.\u2019\n\n    \u201cSo, at this point in history, Fellow Citizens, we have to follow the path of truth and not follow anyone in particular, like a Jim Jones at Jonestown and drink their Kool-Aid.\u201d\n\n    Douglas finishes by saying, \u201cVaccines, vaccine companies, Big Pharma, they are not trying to help you. It\u2019s like the hospitals. They\u2019re just there as a business. They want to do procedures, they want to make money. They want the next test, because it\u2019s all part of the flow of money. But when it comes to Big Pharma, when it comes to the National Institutes of Health and the Centers of Disease Control \u2013 no, no, no \u2013 they are outright \u2013 this is a pogrom. This is genocide. This is a global genocide, literally run from the World Health Organization, from the United Nations and those two organizations \u2013\u201d\n\n    Tyla interjects, \u201c\u2013 And the World Economic Forum. Don\u2019t forget those evil people!\u201d\n\n    \u201cOh, they planned it, remember, they\u2019ve actually had meetings to prepare for this, begged for it \u2013 Fauci threatened that it was going to happen, threatened when it was going to happen and then brought the hammer down.\u00a0 They knew that it was the only thing they had left to create the Big Bang for the \u2018Reset\u2019.\n\n    \u201cAnd the Reset is America no longer exists. We are taken over by global forces. And America will probably be paired-up with Canada and Mexico, in the way that the United Nations plan wants to work. They want to have these economic zones. So, there\u2019s going to be no more nations.\n\n    \u201cBut before that, there has to be this war of All against All. So, what happens? Syria gets bombed. As soon as Syria gets bombed and Damascus, that\u2019s it, Folks. It\u2019s the rain coming down on Noah. And remember, even in the Fatima letters, with Noah or with Lot, they didn\u2019t get to take everybody. A lot of the people didn\u2019t make it.\n\n    \u201cAnd so, when we\u2019re talking about consciousness, are people going make the leap of consciousness that is coming in because of all of these things that we\u2019ve mentioned, the Maunder Minimum, the cosmic rays that are coming in from the stars, stronger now, probably than at any time that they can remember in history? There\u2019s just about the greatest number we\u2019ve ever had of earthquakes, volcanoes, strange storms and so on and so forth.\n\n    \u201cSo, as this Minimum is happening, we can expect all these things; magnetic anomalies. People say that Earth\u2019s axis is going to shift, North to South, South to North. This is has happened before; paleomagnetism proves that. Well yeah, it is is. I\u2019ve been watching the gigantic hole. It gets bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n    \u201cSo, where are we headed? Consciousness. No matter what, humans are a precious thing to the Divine. And they are not going to let a single person be wasted. Even if you are in the lower third and you become an animal-human and then it takes you a little bit longer to become a human\u2026that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s all made in the big plan\u2026\n\n    \u201cJust wake up, look around. Look inside, look outside and create a coherent cosmology. And if you can do that, then no matter what is happening, you can understand it, you can put it in place. You can eventually digest it; that right now, the things that are being stuffed down our throat are just about the worst that I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, just as the four years before were the best that I\u2019ve seen coming out of the White House and Washington DC.\n\n    \u201cBut now, any evil you can think of is becoming a law\u2026\u201d\n\n    Contributed by\n\n\n    You Might Like\n\n    Alexandra Bruce\n\n    View all posts\n\n\n    Leave a Reply to Terry Garrett Cancel reply\n\n    \u2022 Actually most of her explanation of ADE is technically wrong. And there is no way the RNA construct integrates into human DNA. Bold, untrue statements. Exogenous mRNA is degraded by natural processes, so it\u2019s not an \u201con button with no off button\u201d, as she claims. Very misleading statements soley to support her view and unsubstantiated opinion.\n\n    \u2022 Dealing with wokesters\u2026\n      How to deal with a narcissistic gaslighter (AKA militant \u2018Anti-racist\u2019):\n\n      1. Learn to trust your own opinion about yourself: if you don\u2019t trust your own judgement about yourself then you will depend on others to tell you who you are. A narcissist can realise that you care a lot about other people\u2019s opinions then decide to take advantage of that by putting you down to make sure that you never feel good about yourself.\n\n      2. Play indifferent: Gasligting may also involve the narcissist trying to get an emotional reaction from the victim by harshly criticising them or being verbally abusive. When the abuse fails to get the emotional reaction from you that he was looking for, it can demotivate him to keep the gaslighting.\n\n      3. Don\u2019t be defensive: one of the mistakes you can make while dealing with a gasligter is to turn defensive and start giving explanations for your actions or behaviour. Being defensive only gives the gaslighter strength to keep gaslighting you because that\u2019s exactly what they expect. Instead understand their intentions and show them that you give no weight to their opinions, criticism and judgement.\n\n      4. Confront them: confronting a narcissist and telling him that you understand his bad intentions behind his gaslighting behaviour can put him on the defensive. Most narcissist usually try to prove you wrong by not repeating the behaviour. Although this should be your last option and you will need courage to do this because narcissists don\u2019t take confrontation well.\n\n    \u2022 Thank you very much Ms. Bruce for your continuing effective effort in bringing important information into Consciousness. Particularly appreciated this transmission and related podcast in dealing with the currently pertinent Rudolf Steiner teachings.\n\n    \u2022 Thank you, AB, for posting this. This was a great summary of what I have been intuitively putting together myself. The information from the Douglasses will resonate or not. Probably five years ago I would not have been able to accept all of their theories so you may have to keep an open mind and allow yourself to keep growing. Don\u2019t know how accurate they may be, but right now I align with what they are saying.\n\n    \u2022 Do not comply, and buy silver.\n      I\u2019ve been following A.I.M. for a while now.\n      Don\u2019t take an experimental vaccine and become GMO!\n\n    \u2022 Can\u2019t believe it, I just listened to this! It\u2019s what I have come to understand in my own situation. I used to think it was my job to wake people up, but no one is listening. So I decided awhile ago what the Gabriels say here\u2014I must be one who will be on the Ark, a survivor, and all I can do is stand back and let God\u2019s plan fall out the way it\u2019s supposed to, and mourn the ones who blindly followed, or did not Search for the Truth. God gave us a mind and free will, and some people will not put either to good use. A hard sad road ahead.\n\n    \u2022 The Douglas\u2019s are fine people. But they like most DO NOT address the Jewish influence in our society.\n      We cannot win this war if we don\u2019t know who are our true enemies.\n\n    \u2022 \u201cAnimal Humans\u201d\ud83d\ude12I don\u2019t know what that means but it applies a set of humans that you feel superior to..\u270b Now,Bible does say some are written in the Book,some not,some written that WILL be blotted out of the Book of Life!It is NOT from taking this vaccine however,as I assume you rambled about \u201cmark of the beast\u201dthat would be a compact willingly taken knowing it\u2019s evil!!Now about the big big hole you refer to watching CLOSELY,the ozone hole is smaller than any time in my life.You letter gives fear and no solutio...

        "text":"Thursday, January 23, 2014\n\nRoe v. Wade 41 years later\n\nI'm buried this morning and don't have time to develop a post. Yesterday was the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Please keep any discussion civil--I won't have time today to interact much but here are some questions you might discuss:\n  \u2022 What assumptions are involved in the positions Christians take on this issue on both sides? Are they good assumptions?\n  \u2022 What Scriptures are used in this discussion on both sides? \u00a0How good is the exegesis?\n  \u2022 What tactics are most effective in reaching the long term goals on this issue? \u00a0How effective is prohibition? How effective is addressing the causes?\n  \u2022 What are the political implications for whom you support with your vote? Does this issue trump all others when you come to the polls? Why should it or why not?\n  \u2022 To what extent might experiential and anecdotal inputs (e.g., Heaven is for Real) have an impact on our thinking, maybe even over the Bible itself? Are there dangers here?\n  \u2022 Are we consistent in our positions? What would it mean to be pro-life in a thoroughgoing way?\n  \u2022 What exactly did Roe v. Wade say? To what extent are Christian positions on abortion positions that involve religious assumptions? To what extent can they be argued in secular categories?\nI don't have time to participate much in any discussion today. Please don't eat each other alive in your thoughts. Angry responses are often a sign of insecurity in your own position...\n\n\nJohn Mark said...\n\nMy denominational manual says we oppose abortion for the purposes of population control or personal convenience. Life is sacred and should be valued. As we look at the history since Roe; we see over 50 million abortions--it would seem the primary use of abortion is birth control. In a conversation this week with someone whose family has been involved in crisis pregnancy centers and personal ministry to post abortive women I was told that many clinics could be closed by a visit from the local health department. It is a grisly business. The Gosnell case in Philly may be an extreme example, but makes it clear that this is an unregulated 'industry' to say the least. There is a desperate need for oversight.\nProlife people have looked to Ps 139 (yes, a poem) and to Jeremiah's testimony that God called him before birth to support the idea that life begins at conception. I realize these are not proof of viability. But advocates of abortion *on demand* are not concerned with viability.\nAs for complete prohibition, it may not be possible. Abortion was legal in several states before Roe, and to overturn Roe might just send decision making powers back to the states. But 50 or 55 million abortions since Roe should be chilling to anyone. The voting issue is thorny. The 'pro-life' party is the war party, and the anti war party is the pro-abortion party. Apples and oranges, some will say. But our history of totally unrestricted abortion is shameful, and has hurt women in many ways.\n\nAngie Van De Merwe said...\n\nIn an evangelical or fundamentalist (biblical) Christian worldview, there is a Creator that creates specifically and directly in the created order. The created order is specified within scripture, as literal and historical event.\nThere is a distinction made between human life and other life forms, just as a distinction is made between a man and a woman, in a \"Christian biblical worldview\".\nScientific invention, whether through genetic engineering or social engineering, in surrogate parenting, same sex parenting, etc. is against the \"biblical\" interpretation in fundamentalist's camps.\nHuman sexuality is seen as a sacred, instead of a natural human desire. Therefore, the sanctity of marriage, the protection of sexual boundaries, and the marriage as \"useful' for procreation is an ultimate value for 'bibilcal Christians\".\nThe full purpose of marriage cannot be experienced apart from the biological purpose of procreation for a \"biblical Christian\".\nHuman sexuality is not a matter of consent, but a matter of social boundaries\/norms.\nTherefore, there is no such thing as an \"unintended pregnancy\". Even those pregnancies that are unplanned are \"planned by God\", as God is Sovereign (allows what happens, either directly or indirectly). Anyone that prevents the implantation of a fertilized egg, or disturbs the attachment of the embryo has killed a life \"created by God\".\n\nThe assumptions are theological, as well as bibilical, about God's Sovereign intervention in the world and in human affairs and \"His Plan\" or \"standard\".\n\nAngie Van De Merwe said...\n\nOur Country allows for religious liberty, but does not require a religious test for holding office, as religious tests define religious faith, which limits religious liberty!\n\nOur country was to provide Liberty and Justice for ALL, not just a religious person. Individual liberty was protected by Constitutional gurantees against expansive Government oversight. Roe v. Wade was decided because the SCOTUS believed in a woman's protected right to privacy.\n\nPrivacy is about the personal, which protects religious liberty, as well as \"choice\".\n\nPrivacy is also about \"property rights\", which our country also believes to be of value and importance. Many Pro Choice people believe that a woman's right to her body, involves consent as to the reproductive aspects of her body. Self reponsibility is a conservative value, which Pro Choice people believe is an aspect of \"reproductive rights\".\n\nTherefore, our country's values of religious liberty, personal liberty and private property rights, defy the Pro Life arguments.\n\nIt is true that the \"natural rights\" argument used by Aquinas have been used for \"human rights\", but these are irrelavant practically, if Government doesn't acknowledge or grant them.\n\nAngie Van De Merwe said...\n\nJohn Mark,\nThough you do point out that the Democrats and Republicans differ as to what\/whose rights and how they want to protect them is, don't you set up a false dichotomy? As both self defense and choice is necessary for survival and liberty? That is a realistic perspective. Our Country defends the right to self defense (personally and nationally).\n\nYou must believe that \"peace\" (anti-war) and \"all life\" (pro-life) is important to protect. Isn't that an \"idealistic\" perspective? I'd much rather be realistic, then, each entity (individual and nation) can be mutual in relationship\/contract.\n\nAs to respect for \"all life\", death is a part of life, as we must kill in order to eat. Otherwise, WE die!\n\nMartin LaBar said...\n\nI know there are passages that indicate that God knows individuals before they are born. But there are also Old Testament passages that indicate that little children were not specially protected, at least not in war, and also that some people said they wished they had not been born (quotations from World English Bible, public domain):\n\nNumbers 31:15 Moses said to them, . . . [about the Midianites] 17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.\n\nDeuteronomy 2:32 Then Sihon came out against us . . . 34 We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining.\n\nPsalm 137:8 Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,\nhe will be happy who rewards you,\nas you have served us.\n9 Happy shall he be,\nwho takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.\n\nIsaiah 13:13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place in Yahweh of Armies\u2019 wrath, and in the day of his fierce anger. . . . 16 Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be ransacked, and their wives raped. 17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not value silver, and as for gold, they will not delight in it. 18 Their bows will dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb. Their eyes will not spare children.\n\nJeremiah 20:14 Cursed is the day in which I was born.\nDon\u2019t let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.\n15 Cursed is the man who brought news to my father, saying,\n\u201cA boy is born to you,\u201d making him very glad.\n16 Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew,\nand didn\u2019t repent.\nLet him hear a cry in the morning,\nand shouting at noontime;\n17a because he didn\u2019t kill me from the womb;\nand so my mother would have been my grave\n\n(Job said about the same thing)\nHosea 9:14 Give them\u2014Yahweh what will you give?\nGive them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. (This idea is repeated in this chapter.)\n\nGod\u2019s people carried out the killing of babies, as part of warfare against the enemies of Israel. Is that consistent with abortion being sinful? I'm not sure.",

        "text":"The Obamacare 'scandal' you haven't heard about\nFew Bible Belt pastors mention what's in their backyard, millions of poor people trapped in the Obamacare \u201ccoverage gap.\u201d\nNovember 8th, 2013\n10:01 AM ET\n\nThe Obamacare 'scandal' you haven't heard about\n\nBy John Blake, CNN\n\n(CNN)\u00a0- The Rev. Timothy McDonald gripped the pulpit with both hands, locked eyes with the shouting worshippers, and decided to speak the unspeakable.\n\nThe bespectacled Baptist minister was not confessing to a scandalous love affair or the theft of church funds. He brought up another taboo: the millions of poor Americans who won\u2019t get health insurance beginning in January because their states refused to accept Obamacare.\n\nMcDonald cited a New Testament passage in which Jesus gathered the 5,000 and fed them with five loaves and two fishes. Members of his congregation bolted to their feet and yelled, \u201cC\u2019mon preacher\u201d and \u201cYessir\u201d as his voice rose in righteous anger.\n\n\u201cWhat I like about our God is that he doesn\u2019t throw people away,\u201d McDonald told First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta during a recent Sunday service. \u201cThere will be health care for every American. Don\u2019t you worry when they try to cast you aside.\u00a0 Just say I\u2019m a leftover for God and leftovers just taste better the next day!\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s congregation cheered, but his is a voice crying in the wilderness. He\u2019s willing to condemn state leaders whose refusal to accept Obamacare has left nearly 5 million poor Americans without health coverage. But few of the most famous pastors in the Bible Belt will join him.\n\nJoel Osteen? Bishop T.D. Jakes, and other prominent pastors throughout the South?\n\nLike McDonald, they preach in states where crosses and church steeples dot the skyline yet the poor can\u2019t get the health insurance they would receive if they lived elsewhere. All declined to comment.\n\nWhen people talk about the Affordable Care Act, most focus on the troubled launch of its website. But another complication of the law has received less attention: a \u201ccoverage gap\u201d that will leave nearly 5 million poor Americans without health care, according to a Kaiser Health Foundation study.\n\nLearn more from Kaiser about the coverage gap in states that refused Obamacare\n\nThe coverage gap was created when 25 states refused to accept the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare. The people who fall into this gap make too much money to qualify for Medicaid and not enough to qualify for Obamacare subsidies in their state insurance exchanges. If they lived elsewhere, they would probably get insurance. But because they live in a state that refused the new health care law, they likely will remain among the nation\u2019s uninsured poor after Obamacare coverage kicks in come January.\n\nThe coverage gap has been treated as a political issue, but there is a religious irony to the gap that has been ignored.\n\nMost of the people who fall into the coverage gap live in the Bible Belt, a 14-state region in the South stretching from North Carolina to Texas and Florida. The Bible Belt is the most overtly Christian region in the country, filled with megachurches and pastors who are treated like celebrities.\u00a0 All but two Bible Belt states have refused to accept the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\n\nShould Bible Belt pastors say anything publicly about the millions of poor people in their communities stranded by the coverage gap? Is it anti-Christian for state leaders to turn down help for the people Jesus called \u201cthe least of these\"? Or should pastors say nothing publicly about such issues because they are strictly political?\n\nCNN's Sanjay Gupta explains who falls into the coverage gap\n\nWho speaks for the poor in the coverage gap?\n\nWhen these questions were sent to many of the most popular pastors in the Bible Belt, they hit a wall of silence. Virtually no prominent pastor wanted to talk about the uninsured poor in their midst.\n\nJoel Osteen, pastor of the largest church in the nation, declined to be interviewed about the subject. So did Bishop T.D. Jakes. Their megachurches are both in Texas,\u00a0the state with the nation\u2019s highest number of people without health insurance.\n\nMax Lucado, the best-selling Christian author who is a minister at a church in Texas, declined to speak; Charles Stanley, the Southern Baptist pastor in Georgia whose In Touch Ministries reaches millions around the globe, declined to speak; Ed Young Sr. and Ed Young Jr., a father and son in Texas who pastor two of the fastest-growing churches in the nation, also declined to speak.\u00a0\n\nBishop T.D. Jakes declined to talk about the millions of poor people stranded in the \u201ccoverage gap.\"\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nThe silence is not hard to understand. Obamacare is a polarizing political issue in the Bible Belt. A pastor who publicly weighs in on the subject could divide his or her congregation or risk their job. And some prominent pastors like Osteen are popular in part because they\u00a0 do not alienate fans by taking political stands.\n\nThe Rev. Phil Wages, senior pastor Winterville First Baptist Church in Georgia and a\u00a0blogger, was one of the few Bible Belt ministers willing to speak on the subject.\n\nHe says he won\u2019t preach about the coverage gap created by the state\u2019s rejection of the Medicaid expansion because he has what he calls theological differences with the thrust of the new health care law.\n\nWages says the Bible teaches that the care of orphans, widows and the sick are given to the church, not to the government. Early Christians were the first to create hospitals, orphanages and hospices.\n\n\u201cI have an issue with the government coming in to get money through me - through taxes - to take care of people, when my argument is that I should be free to give to charities or to my church in order to take care of the sick and destitute,\u201d he says.\n\nWages says he has no doubt that lack of health insurance is a monumental problem, and that many people are poor because of circumstances beyond their control. Yet there is no New Testament example of Jesus trying to shape public policy on behalf of the poor.\n\n\u201cI do not see any biblical precedent where Jesus ever went to Herod or Pilate and said you should be taking care of the poor,\u201d Wages says. \u201cJesus told his disciples to take care of the poor and the apostles said the same thing to the early church.\u201d\n\nWages\u2019 position is impractical and unbiblical, says Ronald Sider, a longtime advocate for the poor and author of \u201cThe Scandal of Evangelical Politics.\"\n\nChurches and charities don\u2019t have enough resources to take care of an estimated 48 million Americans who don\u2019t have health care. The Bible is filled with examples of God's fury over economic oppression of the poor, which Christians should regard as scandalous, he says.\n\n\u201cIf you are not sharing God\u2019s concern for the poor, it raises huge questions about whether you are a Christian at all,\u201d he says about pastors who say nothing about the uninsured poor.\n\n\u201cAs God\u2019s spokespersons, you ought to be talking about God\u2019s concern for the poor as much as God. In the richest nation in world history, it\u2019s contradictory to have millions without health insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt absolutely stinks\u201d\n\nThe coverage gap may inspire a religious debate, but for its victims the issue is raw and personal.\n\nA recent New York Times article about the coverage gap revealed that many of its victims are the working poor: cooks, cashiers, sales clerks and waitresses.\n\n\u201cThese are people who are working people but they haven\u2019t been able to afford health insurance or their employers don\u2019t offer it and they\u2019re stuck,\u201d says Andy Miller, editor of Georgia Health News, a nonprofit news organization that covers health news in the state. \u201cA lot of these folks have chronic health conditions.\u201d\n\nThey are people like Shelley \u201cMyra\u201d Mitchell, a single mom with four children who makes $9 an hour working at a Chick-fil-A in Georgia. She makes $18,000 a year \u2013 too much for Georgia\u2019s existing Medicaid program, but not enough to qualify for subsidies to sign up for Obamacare\u2019s insurance marketplace in Georgia.\n\nMitchell\u2019s voice grew edgy with frustration when asked to describe her health needs. She rang up about $20,000 in emergency room bills because she has no health insurance. She can\u2019t afford to get pap smears, go to the dentist or get surgery for a two-year-old hernia. She can\u2019t take medication for her depression and anxiety because she can\u2019t afford it.\n\nShe thought she could get help under Obamacare but recently learned she can\u2019t because Georgia did not accept the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cIt stinks,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with this hernia for two years now, and I can\u2019t get anyone to help me because I don\u2019t have health insurance. It absolutely stinks.\u201d\n\nWhy pastors should stay silent about the coverage gap\n\nMitchell\u2019s plight may stink. But at what point should a pastor go public on such a complex issue, and what could he or she actually say?\n\nTwo prominent evangelical pastors openly wrestled with those questions.\n\nAndy Stanley is one of the most popular evangelical pastors in the nation. He is the senior pastor of North Point Community Church in Alpharetta, Georgia, a megachurch with at least 33,000 members. He is also the author of the forthcoming book \u201cHow to be Rich,\u201d which urges Christians to be \"rich in good deeds\" instead of wealth. His church recently announced that it donated $5.2 million to Atlanta charities and provided another 34,000 volunteer hours.\n\nJoel Osteen has the largest church in America. He also declined to speak about the coverage gap.\n\nStanley says the coverage gap disturbs him. The church cannot handle the needs of millions of uninsured people alone and should quit taking shots at government involvement, he says. But he adds that it\u2019s not anti-Christian for political leaders in states like Georgia to turn down the Medicaid expansion for the poor.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to know how concerned someone is for the poor ask them what percentage of their personal money they give to organizations that help the po...

Before He even created the universe, GOD knew that Ted Bundy and Jeffery Dahmer would be His followers.\n\nHe also knew that their sin nature would lead them to commit horrible crimes prior to their conversion. GOD knows the future and He allowed those sins to be committed. If GOD doesn't know the future, then He's not GOD.\n\nThis should be an encouragement to any true Christian, because it only helps to underscore the fact that we are never too far gone for GOD's forgiveness while we are still alive.\nReply With Quote",

A troll had repeatedly posted garbage and I was responding to this sick individual.\n\n\u201cMohammad the deceiver was a pedophile, and, his misguided followers to this day still revere him as the \u201cperfect example\u201d. Pedophilia runs rampant throughout Islamic history and into the 21st century.\nThe Hadith explicitly details Mohammad\u2019s grooming of a nine year old girl which started when he married her at six. He consummated the \u201cmarriage\u201d \/raped Aisha at age nine, but, was \u201cthighing\u201d this young child for roughly three years. She was still playing with dolls when this perverted 54 year old man raped her.\nSahih Bukari 7:62-64\nSahih Muslim 8:3311\nSahih Muslim 31:5981\n\nIf we refer to the Hadith, Mohammad is recorded to have \u201cprophesied\u201d through dreams about Aisha when she was a toddler (more accurately, he fantasized about raping a toddler). In fact, he justified his direct intention to rape the child through these particularly disturbing \u201crevelations\u201d of which he is quoted to have said to Aisha\u2019s father, \u201cshe has been made lawful to me\u201d\nSahih Bukari Vol 9 , Book 87, Hadith 140\nSahih Bukari Vol 7, Book 62, Number 18\n\nAs you can imagine, Aisha\u2019s father was disturbed by this and objected, trying not to unleash Mohammad\u2019s wrath upon his family; he said, \u201cBut I am your brother\u201d. Mohammad the pedophile rebuked him and maintained his \u201cdivine\u201d position to commit pedophilia by saying, \u201cYou are my brother in Allah\u2019s religion and his book, but she (Aisha) is lawful to me to marry\u201d\nSahih Bukari 7:62:90\n\nThen there is a graphic description of Mohammad sucking the tongue of his cousin\u2019s son, his name was Ali Hassan. It\u2019s unclear how old the child was when Mohammad molested him, though it\u2019s probable he was under eight years old, as Mohammad died in 632 AD aged 63, and Hassan was born in 625 AD\nMusnad Ahmad Hadith Number 16245\n\nChildren tend to be a good judge of character and there is a Hadith which records one particular occasion when a child was brought to \u201cthe prophet\u201d, and made to sit on his lap, where immediately the child urinated all over Mohammad.\nSahih Bukari 1:4:224\n\nYoung children can and do wet themselves when frightened. Perhaps this child sensed Mohammad\u2019s evil intentions to harm him.\n\nThe Hadith also confirms pedophilia by recording \u201cthe prophet\u201d admonishing a soldier for marrying an older woman, insisting \u201cyoung girls are better to fondle\u201d. This Hadith story also exposes Mohammad as he hinted his preference for all wives to shave their pubic region, little girls do not possess pubic hair.\nSahih Bukari 7:62:16 &17\n\nIslamic pedophilia, like all pedophilia is a horrific crime against children; and humanity as a whole. Ayan Ray, there is no defending the indefensible.\"\ncommented 2017-12-29 21:10:07 -0500\nI posted this about 8 months ago, there was an apologist posting on a thread, so I responded with,\n\u201cAccording to the Hadith, Mohammad told Aisha\u2019s father when she was a small toddler that Aisha is lawfully his. Mohammad was a pedophile, and children cannot give consent. Islamists always refer to Aisha consummating her marriage at age 9; making it sound like this child had a say in the matter. He raped her at age nine, but, engaged in a sick sexual practice when she was six until age nine. It is called thighing, he used her thighs to masterbate with. He also had a bath ritual too!\nIt is absolutely astounding Mohammadans continue to rationalize his arranged marriage with a child bride and the ensuing sexual abuse. She was 18 when he was poisoned. She endured the sick sexual behaviour of an old man, and Mohammad\u2019s other wives were jealous of the \u201cattention\u201d he bestowed upon her. Unbelievable and deplorable. It is my understanding in pre-Islamic times in Arabia, children did not marry & \u201cconsummate\u201d.\u201d\ncommented 2017-12-29 20:33:54 -0500\n\u2026was a pedophile?\nHow can they say he was the perfect man?\nYou know I wouldn\u2019t give a rats ass except that the west is now expected to live beside\/with this barbarism. Islam can do what ever it wants as long as it stays out of the west.\nHere already? Then you can\u2019t do what ever you want.\nMerry Christmas, Happy New Year Tommy.\ncommented 2017-12-29 20:17:19 -0500\nMohamed = the evil personification of Islam that every Muslim absolutely worship.\nIn the Christian Bible he is called \u201cThe Devil\u201d, \u201cSatan\u201d, \u201cBeelzebub\u201d, \u201cBeast\u201d and many other descriptive evil names, all of which fit him perfectly.\ncommented 2017-12-29 20:05:23 -0500\nSince 9\/11 \u2013 IN THE NAME OF ISLAM (SATAN): 34,561 Attacks, 224,584 Killed, 303,991 Injured that we know of.",

I have bookmarked this topic for further examination.\nAugust 06, 2017, 02:22:46 am\nRe: The Symbol of the Serpent\nSince the Serpent is the symbol of our own order, I thought it would be good to begin a discussion of the Serpent as a symbol in various religions and cultures.\n\nTo begin with, the most obvious example is, of course, the Genesis Serpent.\u00a0 After being warned that if they eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil they will \"surely die,\" the serpent tells Eve (or Chava, as I prefer the Hebrew names) that she will not die, but rather that they will become like god, and god does not wish that to happen.\u00a0 Sure enough, once the fruit is eaten, the Angel says \"Now he is like us.\"\u00a0 In this, arguably the central myth of the Judeo-Christian mythology, the Serpent tells the truth, and God lies.\u00a0 Genesis makes no attempt to obfuscate it.\u00a0 This makes it clear to me that the Genesis Serpent is not intended to be a stand-in for evil, but rather is used as the Serpent is often used in mythology and symbolism, to represent knowledge and wisdom and, in the case of the Genesis myth, as the supplier of isolate consciousness and self awareness; to place it into our own terms, the guardian of Xeper, and the custodian of the path to godhood.\n\nThere are many other examples of the Serpent as a symbol for wisdom.\u00a0 The Caduceus and Rod of Asclepius are two more well known examples.\u00a0\n\nThe Egyptian netjer Wadjet takes the form of a Serpent, and is the protector of Lower Egypt, associated with other netjeru including Bast, Sakhmet, and Mut (the World-Mother).\u00a0 In this role she takes on a solar aspect, as Bast and Sakhmet are Eyes of Ra, but Wadjet is also associated with the eclipsing binary star Algol (meaning \"The Demon,\" appropriately enough), which represents the eye in the severed head of Medusa in the modern constellation Perseus.\u00a0 I've been interested in Wadjet as a stellar netjer for a while and may put together an essay on the subject.\n\nWhat are some other favorite instances of the Serpent in mythology?\n\nBolded by me. I'm so glad I came across this thread, because this is exactly what I'd hope to learn - why is the Christian view of the serpent in the garden, 'evil?' As a former Christian, I'd say that one of the main tenets of faith, has to do with not being self-important. To be concerned with self, to want to care for ourselves independent of a god, would be considered sinful. The truth though is, self awareness is empowering, and positive. It's not evil. It's not negative. But, the Christian slant is that it negates the need for a god to guide our lives, if we think that we can control our own thoughts and actions.\n\nAs a former Christian, I remember thinking that the story was absurd and that anyone who would take it literally, was gullible. But, Christianity also passes the serpent off to be god-like. On the same par with God. Which when we think about it, that makes no sense, really. If I'm self aware, I'm god-like? But, God from the stories I've read in the Bible, is thought to be omniscient and omnipotent. So, how could eating the forbidden fruit turn us into almighty powerful gods?\n\nThe story at best, is an allegory for morality, or perhaps, to scare Christians into thinking that if you disobey God, horrible things will happen. Any way we view this story, it sounds ridiculous at the least, and horrifying at its worst. Genesis was where I lost my respect for Christianity, and that's what would be the beginning of the end for me, with religion in general.\n\nThe serpent was telling the truth, that is mind blowing for someone like me, who always was taught that the serpent was the liar of the story.\u00a0 :rolleyes:\n\n@Deidre I agree that all of what you have said in response to this thread is metaphysically correct. It is difficult to come to terms with it especially from a Christian background. This was similar to my situation as I was raised with a Catholic upbringing. I resolved that it was better to investigate than to believe falsely. Whatever choice you take, make certain that it is you that determines it for yourself rather than someone or something else that is not you.\n\nAugust 06, 2017, 03:55:01 am",

        "text":"Saturday, January 12, 2008\n\nThoughts on racism (part 11)\n\n[To read the entire series, click on \"racism\" on the sidebar under \"POSTS BY CATEGORIES\".]\n\nEldest Son recently attended a prayer meeting where he was the only \"white\" person there --- every other person was Asian in heritage. His descriptions of the passion that his fellow Believers brought to intercessory prayer made me so thankful that he is worshiping with believers outside of just his narrow ethnic and social boundaries. As I told him, the wonderful thing about fellowshipping cross-culturally is that we are able to see Jesus a bit more clearly, without our own cultural baggage --- baggage that we are usually incapable of realizing that we carry.\n\nAs the Body of Christ, what unites us is Jesus Himself. Culture and race should never divide us. Yes, there is something of great value in hearing the message of salvation in our \"heart language\", in being able to pray and fellowship in our native tongue. But there is something wildly freeing about stepping outside of our culture, outside of our race, and seeing Jesus as we've never seen Him before.\n\nI fear that my words are woefully inadequate in expressing what I mean. Input, anyone? I'd love to hear about your experiences of cross-cultural church and christian fellowship.\n\nEdited slightly for clarity.\n\n\n  1. I think it was Martin Luther King who said something like the most segregated hour in all of America is 11 am Sunday morning. And that is still true. I struggle with that. My own church is about 97% white. There is a lot of economic diversity, which I think is a plus. Anyhoo.....\n\n    Last Sunday was one of the most meaningful services I have ever attended at my church. We've been sponsoring a congregation in Maputo, Mozambique, for many years. Our guest preacher Sunday was a young man we've sponsored through Africa University, and now he's attending divinity school at Emory. He, his wife, and young child particiated in our services -- his wife sang a solo in an African language. The national language of Mozambique is Portuguese. And sort of spontaneously, our music director, a Brazilian of Italian descent, decided to offer to sing a version of the Lord's Prayer in Portuguese in response to the sermon, as a gift to the family. We were all in tears by the time he was done. And then the African pastor gave us our benediction in Portuguese. Nobody quite got it all, but it was so clear, through the service, that there was such a desire to please God and to offer up gifts of love, service, and tribute to each other that it was as meaningful as any service I have ever attended.\n\n  2. Well, Rebecca, I remember once when we went to all black church, except for our white family. The music was VERY different. The women ran up and down the aisles with these long, colored scarves. Then everyone got up on the pews to dance. After about 4 hours of this, we had to take the last bus home because we didn't have our car yet, so we didn't get to stay for the sermon. It was definitely an unforgettable experience!\n\n  3. Well said!\n\n    Having just moved to the St. Louis area, I was very lonely for my family and friends. In other words, I would rather have curled up in a fetal position and cried all day long and I probably would have if it weren't for my many responsibilities which make me keep on keeping on.\n\n    A few weeks after moving here, one of our neighbors, a couple from the Philippines invited us over for a Saturday lunch. I couldn't believe they wanted our whole family to come over but they did. We arrived at their home and were stunned by the amount of food he had cooked. It was amazing and I felt rather bad since our \"little\" family wouldn't even put a dent into it. He used to be a chef in a Chinese restaurant before he became a doctor so he loves to cook and it is the best I have tasted. Soon after we arrived, others started arriving until there were 50 or more of their friends and relatives there, too. I was amazed at the whole thing and the dynamics of the families that were so close since many generations live together instead of apart.\n\n    As we were leaving, I thanked him for such a lovely time. I told him how much this had brightened my day since I had been missing \"home\" so very much. He told me that we were now part of his family and we were welcome there anytime. Well, that did it. I started to cry. And he stood there apologizing for making me cry even though I was explaining that it was not him at all.\n\n    I can't imagine what I would be missing if I was only around people just like me. I would be missing so much beauty. I am also very pleased that my children have friends who are from the various different ethnic groups.\n\n    Our church has many various ethnic groups and they have ethnic potlucks where the tables are dressed in colors from a certain country and then authentic dishes are brought from each of those countries. Wow! We have a Korean lady and a Japanese lady in our church who make some awesome sushi among other authentic dishes. I enjoy talking to them about their lives in these countries and getting their perspective on some of the issues that we face here. A lot of wisdom can be found there, for sure!\n\n  4. We used to go to a large church in Milwaukee, WI where they truly blended the various different cultural aspects and it was done beautifully. Every Sunday was a bit different as far as the worship. The pastor there was a doctor who had served in Africa for many years. It was on Milwaukee's East side so we had many different ethnic groups represented along with the very \"artsty\" crowd. They were some of the best years of my life.",

        "text":"Thursday, August 16, 2007\n\nBack Where I Began\n\nAfter ten years in exile Lisa & I have finally crossed the Tiber back to Rome. The years spent in Protestant pastures have been quite an adventure. If I've learned anything during our sojourneying it's that the grass is not necessarily greener on either side of the fence. There is much that Catholics can learn from their separated brothers and sisters and vise versa. Having said that, I'm convinced that the best show in town is in the Catholic Church in spite of its own weaknesses and shortcomings.\n\nIt has been a difficult journey back to Rome, yet now that we've made that choice and been received back into communion it feels like a giant weight has been lifted off my shoulders. We've come out of the Catholic closet to just about all of our friends and have been blessed by their encouragement. I still don't know for sure what will happen to our community, Matthew's House. For our part we've decided to continue gathering on Sunday evenings with our small group and continue sharing our lives with one another while supporting each other in our pursuit of Jesus.\n\nWe've been warmly welcomed back into the fold by Fr. John Caulfield at St. Joseph's here in Lakeland. I'm sure there could have been a temptation for some finger wagging & \"you should've known betters\" but that didn't happen. He has been very understanding and encouraging to our great relief.\n\nMy hope & resolution is to stay more current and consistent with this new blog, althoughI think I've made that promise before with less than encouraging results. I want to post about our experiences over these past years to share what we've learned and how it translates into where we're going. Of course, I also want to be a little more proactive on posting about theology and current events as well. The name of the new blog, Mysterium Dei, loosely translates as the \"Mystery of God\". I can't help but think that it will come into use again if\/when we ever realize our dream of developing an lay monastic community--yet another blogging topic.\n\n\n+ Alan said...\n\nWell alright then. One more secret I don't have to keep. ha! Grace and Peace to you and the family. The journey continues...\n\nTiber Jumper said...\n\nHey Tom:\nI found your blog via the Creech Man.\nWelcome home!!\nI was left the Church as a 14 year old and it took me 31 years to navigate back.(Though it was the holy Spirit that brought me back, it's all grace!) I look forward to hearing your perspectives.\nThank the Lord your community was encouraging. That has been the hardest part for me, the shunning by friends and folks we were once close to.\n\nGod bless you.\n\nonionboy said...\n\nWelcome home. I am a former protestant minister of about 20 years. I moved from the evangelical mega church thing to toy with emergent but the logical and honest path was to Rome. I am still paying for it in terms of not yet having landed solid employment and a loss of many who were friends, however I would do it all again if I had too. Peace be with you.\n\nO | |\n\nMMajor Fan said...\n\nWelcome home! Cradle Catholic here, looking forward to the creche filling up again.\n\nTom Mohan said...\n\nI share the mysterious experience of being clearly led by the Holy Spirit to live and work as part of Christ's mystical body apart from my original life as a Roman Catholic only to be just as clearly led back again. I think we share in some small way in the apostolic experience of St. Paul.\n\nI have followed the Holy Spirit and found myself clinging to driftwood wondering if the decision that led me there was correct (speaking of my own experience here not yours of which I am only partially familiar), but in the context of time it turns out to have been all part of God's full mission for my life.\n\nMy own return to full communion as a Roman Catholic came in the midst of training to be a Vineyard church planter - and I am certain that I received a rich deposit of teaching and training that I could not have received any other way.\n\nI sense we live in a time where Christ's prayer for unity in St. John's gospel is coming to pass.\n\nI am very encouraged when the experience of other families parallels our own because it gives me a sense I am moving in the right direction.\n\nJP Manzi said...\n\n\nI pray you find the peace that we all hope for!\n\nAntonio said...\n\nY E S !!!!!\n\nWelcome home!!!\n\ntom said...\n\nThanks everyone for your support.\n\nJoyful Catholics said...\n\nWelcome Home. I never tire of reading and listening to Journey Home stories, such as yours.\n\nDrop by sometime.\n\n\nCraig said...\n\nTOM!!!! I have been trying to get a hold of you for months. Lots of internet searches with dead ends. Today Bernie told me about your blog and your return to the Church. I can not tell you how excited I was to hear!\n\nyou can e-mail me at\n\nPax et Bonum,\n\n\nJennifer said...\n\nThis is the best news of the year! Thank you so much for sharing your journey all along the way. I've followed some of it online.. If you and Lisa and fam ever want to come to Rome italy, please get in touch!! Im living here and working on a phd in theo. My love to you all. God bless you!!! In Christ, Jennifer Coffey, fus '96",

        "text":"Darwin\u2019s 200th Birthday\n\nOn February 12, 1809, two hundred years ago today, Charles Darwin was born. It\u2019s difficult to overstate the impact that his theory of evolution has had over the last 150 years.\n\nThe book by which he is best known, Origin of Species (or On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life), is available in our Harvard Classics and Fiction Collection (71 Vols.), which is currently on Pre-Pub. If you haven\u2019t yet pre-ordered this set, be sure to check it out. It\u2019s an incredible value\u2014about $1.41 per volume!\n\nIn light of this important day and the impact Darwin has had on the relationship between science and the Christian faith, we put together a Creation and Science Product Guide, which features all of our titles on creation, evolution, and science.\n\nIn the product guide you\u2019ll find three collections and almost 30 individual titles:\n\nThe titles are written from a variety of perspectives and will help you grapple with the relationship between faith and science. So be sure to check it out and see which ones might be good additions to your library.\n\nBy the way, if you purchased the B. B. Warfield Collection (20 Vols.), you might want to read Warfield\u2019s article \u201cCharles Darwin\u2019s Religious Life: A Sketch in Spiritual Biography\u201d (The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Volume 9: Studies in Theology [Bellingham, WA: Logos, 2008], 541-81). It\u2019s a fascinating look into Darwin\u2019s spiritual journey.\n\n\n  1. It\u2019s amazing how every time I post a link back to stilltruth.com the post never seems to get through. Such as the link to the Darwin PBB I posted this morning. Not to mention a few others I\u2019ve posted on the blog.\n    I\u2019m thinking an overzealous spam filter is killing them.\n\n  2. Sorry about that, TC. Yes, our filter doesn\u2019t like links very well. If you send something and don\u2019t see it come up, just drop me an email and I\u2019ll go looking for it in our spam comments.\n\n  3. Were you planning to port some of ICR\u2019s (Institute for Creation Research)works such as Henry Morris\u2019 books and others?\n\n  4. I second Jim\u2019s request for som ICR material\n\n  5. Scott Bearer says:\n\n    You must buy the Harvard Classics 71 vols. It is an amazing buy! $1.41 per volume. We will improve our ministries so much by being conversant with the Classics of Western Civilization. By knowing the great ideas of the Bible and philosophy we will be able to preserve our political heritage of freedom in order to preserve the ability to freely speak the Gospel. This pre-pub is only about 60% ready to go, so we need alot more buys. Trust me, my life has been changed by the Bible and the Great Books! We need the education of the Reformers and the Founding Fathers. Please consider buying this pre-pub. You will not regret it!\n    God Bless, Scott Bearer\n    p.s. call with any questions about buying this: 954-464-0088\n\n  6. Henry M. Morris book the Genesis Flood would be a great addition.\n\n  7. I would love to see ICR material along with Anwers In Genesis resources.\n\n  8. Thanks for the suggestion, Jeremy.\n\n  9.

        "text":"The Official Writing Challenge\nThis article has been read 1433 times\nMember Comments\nA gripping read. A clever twist to make the word 'enter' an imperative.\nWe (the reader) are not clued in to where this couple may be trapped and why. The scripture you gave Rev.3:20 is used but misquoted to fit the theme of \"enter\", take care not to use scripture to fit your purposes. You have good imagination though.\nThere are so many parallels in this one...captivity, darknses, hopelessness...the things that crush the hearts of those without Christ. Then there is the need for quiet so they could figure out the answer and also so they could hear the knocking. Reminded me of Psalm 46:10...\"Be still and know that I am God...\"\n\nThe gradual awareness and then the desire to cry out to God are indicative of someone beginning to hear the voice of truth. Then the understanding of the only way to freedom.\n\nThere are a few things that you might consider tweaking. I agree with the comment about the designer jeans...I wasn't sure what the meaning behind that particular description was. And if you decide to use the passage of scripture about Jesus knocking and entering, you might consider reworking the end a little bit so it will fit better.\n\nOne other suggestion (just a thought)...somehow weave the working of the Holy Spirit into the descriptive mix.\n\nGood work! You are a good writer.\nYou already have good comments, so I'll just leave quietly.\nClarissa's comment is precisely what I was thinking.\nThis is a good writing, but it is working so hard to stick to topic. The way out of this room (\"ENTER\" to Exit - you should work for start to turn off)... focus... umm, the way out is 10,5,19,21,19.\nDialogue is very good.\nNote from author:\n\nI feel I need to explain a little to me fellow readers. 1). This is an allegory of \"entering\" into a relationship with Christ. Before salvation a person is surrounded by hopelessness, doom, filth etc...Only by entering into that relationship with Christ can one be free.\n2). The verse is not misquoted it's taken straight from the NIV version. I acknowledged that \"enter\" (found within the verse) was mine, but I put that in there to further communicate the point that entering in a relationship with Christ is a two way street. \"...I will come in...(to come in can mean \"to enter in) and \"...he with me..\" We have to be willing to enter into that relationship and the code was there to reinforce the point that when we look, when we reach out to Him, He's there waiting and willing to reveal Himself to us.\n\nAll that to say, sorry if I was too abstract. I honestly didn't think I was.Thank you all for your encouraging and helpful comments!\nAn intriguing blend of allegory and realism, and an interesting read.\nYou had my full attention, wondering exactly what prison this couple was in and how they got there. I, too, had difficulty understanding the comment \"Her favorite designer jeans bore the imprint of an untimely fate with an almost certain death-this room.\" What imprint? But for that, the article worked for me all the way up to the last paragraph. After their anxiety and despair, I don't think Jesus quoting Revelation 3:20 would 'do it' for them. Al and Clara wanted to be released. You didn't show that they were. Suspenseful writing up to the end.\n\nI just reread that sentence about the jeans. Opps! I accidently deleted the sentence I had written before it. I had written about how they(jeans) were ripped, dirty etc...And that(the current condition of the jeans) was the imprint. I was referring to the dismal state the jeans were in and comparing them to thier hopeless situation.\n\nI must have missed that when I was trying to shorten this story in fit in the word limit.\n\nJessica, I really like this!\n\nWhat made you choose metal walls instead of tradional ones?\n\nYou planted a pretty clear picture in describing circumstances while giving voice to the characters.\n\nAND, I can't help but laugh while reading your response to the delete. Makes me feel more human in my errors.\nAn interesting read. Good visual and dialogue.\nVery cool - and congrats :)\nThis was a very creative one Jessica, and scored high marks with me last week. the best part was when the guy said it was so easy, yet they had been trying to figure it out for so long.\nI was with you! All the way! I know the feeling of entrapment, and the reality of something that seems like a secret code, and just not \"getting it\" - then realizing freedom is all about God's reaching out to us, and our receiving it! Nicely done! I really, really enjoyed this one. :-)",
