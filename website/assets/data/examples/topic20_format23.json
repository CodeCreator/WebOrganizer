I initially entered my tree by importing a .ged file from MyHeritage. Apart from over 40 errors about unreadable lines with no explanation, Gramps appeared to import a lot of my data OK, including spouses and dates and places of marriages. However trying to enter a spouse with a data and place of marriage using Gramps menus proved impossible for me to fathom. I could enter a spouse, and separately enter an event called Marriage with a date and place, but could not get Gramps to list the spouse and the marriage details in the same way as the imported data from MyHeritage. this leads me to conclude that Gramps stores them as separate unrelated data items? In any case, the help is useless, since it says that next to the Family lable there is an [Add] button or [+], when in fact there is only a [-] (minus) button. I eventually found the Add Partner button on the (Mac) top menu bar, but even this does not have the functionality described in the Help files.\nI\u2019m sure this is a powerful tool, but\u2026 (a) is its data structure compatible with other tools so that imported data is represented in the same way as in-tool entered data? and\u2026 (b) I get the feeling after an hour or two plugging away that the best way to enter data is to use another tool (e.g. MyHeritaage) and import to Gramps using .ged flles\u2026. Or (hey) I could just use another tool.\n\nBiggest Pro: looks powerful\nBiggest Con: impossible to use with any confidence I am doing it right.\n\nGramps Review by rci,\u00a0 Sep 29, 2016\n\n1 out of 51 out of 51 out of 51 out of 51 out of 5\n\nthis has to be the most UN-intuitive program I\u2019ve ever seen. Whoever maintains this dinosaur needs to think\u2026\u2026. the very first thing a person needs is a way to start a family tree but instead of naming a file and starting to fill in the info on the person you\u2019re starting with, it takes you on some round about journey that isn\u2019t clear nor intuitive. The help file isn\u2019t very helpful either. Linux needs a genealogy program but this one needs to be rebuilt or rearranged or something to make it usable\u2026..\n\nBiggest Pro: free\nBiggest Con: how do you get started ???\n\nGramps Review by Gail T,\u00a0 Aug 21, 2016\n\n4 out of 54 out of 54 out of 54 out of 54 out of 5\n\nWorks really well, no installation issues both Gramps 4.2.3 and Gramps 5.0.0-alpha1. For those of you reviewing I suggest mentioning what version you tried as older version do suck a bit.\n\nBiggest Pro: Free, wide range of reports and addon\nBiggest Con: Workflow could be improved, too many clicks (So do yourself a favor and install the 3rd party \u201cForm Addon\u2019s\u201d\n\nGramps Review by J T Waterfield,\u00a0 Jun 20, 2016\n\nNot Rated\n\nSo I tried this after the Windows version (which didn\u2019t work, see other review). I\u2019m sorry, I reckon I\u2019m pretty good with software, but this just proved impossible to set up. I\u2019m full of admiration for those who build and maintain software that is good enough for others to use, and I\u2019m sure this is as good as lots of people report, but it just isn\u2019t going to work for me.\n\nBiggest Pro: Free?!\nBiggest Con: Couldn\u2019t get it installed.\n\nGramps Review by Martin H. Watson,\u00a0 Jun 15, 2016\n\n4 out of 54 out of 54 out of 54 out of 54 out of 5\n\nMark Twain said something like \u201cWhen I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.\u201d\n\n6 months ago, as a total novice genealogist but with a lifetime in IT tech support behind me, I looked at GRAMPS and thought it looked slick but bewildering. I put it to one side and started using \u2018My Family Tree\u2019 by Chronoplex, which was simple, and easy for me to input my limited data, 90+ records. 6 months later I was finding it a bit limited, and wanted greater customisation, and web publishing options. I imported my GEDCOM data into GRAMPS and after just an hour, experimenting with it, and generating reports and HTML pages, populated with my own real data, I am stunned. It will take a long time for me to fully understand and exploit all the functionality, but I am totally converted to GRAMPS. Remember to keep a initial GEDCOM file, so that when you are fully familiar with it, you can start again from the GEDCOM file, after trying lot of experiments. If you\u2019ve tried it before and not liked it, try it with your current GEDCOM data file. I never give 5 stars to any review unless it comes with free beer. 4\/5 is as good as I ever give.\n\nBiggest Pro: Free and sophisticated, and well worth persevering with.\nBiggest Con: Hard on beginner genealogists and\/or those with limited IT knowledge, but one day, you see the light. Wow!\n\nGramps Review by Ben Weston,\u00a0 Apr 20, 2016\n\n5 out of 55 out of 55 out of 55 out of 55 out of 5\n\nI migrated my family tree from Family Tree Maker to Gramps recently and I have become very impressed with it. At first it felt a bit clunky but after a very short while I started to appreciate its depth and power. It is very flexible and now I have learnt the basics using it is very straightforward. I am quite a light weight in the world of genealogical research but I get the feeling that Gramps is suitable not only for relative novices, such as myself, but also contains features that will satisfy serious researchers.\n\nBiggest Pro: The ability to tailor the views of almost every screen using gramplets.\nBiggest Con: Takes a while to discover all its features and how to access them (thanks be to Google).\n\nGramps Review by Dawn Dove,\u00a0 Feb 21, 2016\n\nNot Rated\n\nWell after reviewing the web for a couple of days I thought to load Gramps and give it a whirl..After 5 hours I have given up.\nConsistently locked my file and secondary pop windows are hidden behind the main screen. Not intuitive for this old dog although I grew up with DOS and have upgrade my knowledge for 20 years.\nThis may be a great program but I ended up wiping off my system.\n\nBiggest Pro: sorry too frustrated to give a thumbs up.\nBiggest Con: Wanted a simple family tree on digital to give to kids.\n\nGramps Review by Peter,\u00a0 Jan 26, 2016\n\n5 out of 55 out of 55 out of 55 out of 55 out of 5\n\nGramps is a very sophisticated full featured genealogy software programme, with many more features and capabilities that what I have seen in commercial products. For example, sources are managed at three levels (citation, source and repository) and places are managed in a hierarchy structure (town, county, state, country). Reports and charts are very good. The Gramplet plugins bring more features.\nBest of all, it is open source, so your data is not locked in come proprietary file format.\n\nBiggest Pro: lots of functionality for the serious genealogist\nBiggest Con: all those functions can make it difficult to learn\n\nGramps Review by Peter,\u00a0 Jan 15, 2016\n\n4 out of 54 out of 54 out of 54 out of 54 out of 5\n\nStarted somewhere with version 2.x and upgraded continuously to current version. No problems, no data losses. Has lots of possibilities to enter sources and media as well as graphical and text reports and web sites of your family tree.\n\nBiggest Pro: Free, runs on Linux and Windows, very flexible\nBiggest Con: takes time to find out\/discover all the possibilities and ways of working\n\nGramps Review by Mathieu,\u00a0 Jan 11, 2016\n\n5 out of 55 out of 55 out of 55 out of 55 out of 5\n\nTo benefit from this soft, you must be well organized for your photos and sources management. But when it is, Gramps greatly helps to work your trees.\n\nBiggest Pro: Freedom Software; Sources management\nBiggest Con: GUI using many popup-windows requires a screen of great size\n\nGramps Review by Colin,\u00a0 Dec 21, 2015\n\n3 out of 53 out of 53 out of 53 out of 53 out of 5\n\nNeither intuitive nor easy to learn.\nI am sympathetic to open source software, but this really does feel like its been cobbled together by a committee who set out to design a horse and came up with a camel.\nI finally gave up when I bought a new computer and tried to load my backup into the new download of Gramps. It was really hard to find out how to do this basic task. While I managed it in the end, as far as I was concerned, that was the end. Software this difficult to use has no place on my computer.\n\nBiggest Pro: Free. Does the job\nBiggest Con: Difficult to learn. Not at all intuitive\n\nGramps Review by Doug E,\u00a0 Dec 19, 2015\n\n1 out of 51 out of 51 out of 51 out of 51 out of 5\n\nI agree. Incomprehensible. It is supposed to have \u201cshared events\u201d. Input an event, such as a family reunion, then try to share the event among the six participants. Good frickin\u2019 luck. And if it is in fact easy, why is there no procedural help? The help file, in the form of a Wiki, is essentially useless in identifying the steps that o... (truncated)",

        "text":"Craig Wilson | Rando: one picture, one person\npost-template-default,single,single-post,postid-83,single-format-standard,edgt-core-1.1.2,ajax_fade,page_not_loaded,,vigor-ver-2.1, vertical_menu_with_scroll,smooth_scroll,transparent_content,wpb-js-composer js-comp-ver-4.12,vc_responsive\n\nRando: one picture, one person\n\nIt\u2019s Rando\u2018s contrarian premise that first led me to download it for iOS in June (it\u2019s since added versions for Android and Windows Phone).\u00a0You take a picture (cropped to a circle) and it gets sent to another, random Rando user. In exchange for each picture you send you receive one, also from a random user.\u00a0That\u2019s it.\n\nThere are no options to share sent or received images to social networks or email them. There\u2019s no way to communicate with the recipients of your images, or the senders of those you receive. A recent update added the ability to manipulate a smiley face between a smile and a frown, but that\u2019s the extent of the interaction on offer.\n\nThe only data Rando gives you about an image \u2014 if a user agrees to it when they install the app \u2014 is its location.\n\nMost of Rando\u2019s charm lies in the location information shared by its users, so it\u2019s disappointing when someone turns off location sharing during setup. The company\u2019s hinted it might nudge such users down the line to reconsider.\n\nI\u2019ve received images from a Fox News studio in Chicago, one of a man in Iceland with a pencil up his nose and all sorts of photos from South Korea \u2014 undoubtedly home to the Rando\u2019s most active user base (and it\u2019s biggest, according to a TechCrunch article in May).\n\nOriginally Rando only offered a stream of received images (with sent ones saved to your phone\u2019s photo library) and their origin, but the addition of a stream of sent images means you can now see where yours land up, too. There\u2019s a lot of potential for Rando to expand this functionality to interactive maps of sent and received images without removing the anonymity that sets it apart from conventional sharing and social services.\n\nIncredibly, despite Rando being incredibly suited to inappropriate imagery, I haven\u2019t received any. Seriously, not a testicle, nipple or anything else remotely adult. That said, I have seen a few pairs of trousers around ankles and a wider variety of toilet rolls and holders than anyone needs to.\n\nI\u2019ve seen plenty of interiors, food, trinkets and pets. This may be on account of the inability to use existing images \u2014 each has to be captured using the app. There\u2019s the temptation, especially when exploring the app for the first time, to take lots of images quickly, and that usually means lots of crummy ones. Add to this other people doing the same and the number of excellent photos, of the sort it\u2019s easy to find on services like Instagram or Flickr, isn\u2019t high.\n\nBut then, that\u2019s not the point with Rando. The great pictures you do receive with it are more enthralling than those of other photo sharing services. Not only do you only know, at best, the city of origin \u2014 which adds a mystique most images lack thanks to metadata and share-everything culture \u2014 but you know that the image exists only with you and the sender.\n\nThe service\u2019s immediacy is also enticing. It can take a minute (or a few) to receive an image after you send one, but when something grand or beautiful or inspiring arrives from a foreign country in the midst of a mundane day in your part of the world it doesn\u2019t have the same jealousy-inducing tendency that pictures shared to social media do.\n\nIf social media\u2019s mantra is \u201cLook how amazing my life is!\u201d \u2014 and many argue that\u2019s the way things are heading \u2014 Rando\u2019s is \u201cHere\u2019s my ordinary life, show someone yours\u201d.\n\nOf course, Randos (as developer UsTwo would like their users to refer their circular snapshots) have begun popping up on traditional social media thanks to people taking screenshots of them. I\u2019ve done so myself, but it doesn\u2019t put me off the service any more than sharing my city with a random stranger does. Frankly, the idea of someone sharing one of my more carefully-composed images with their social networks without my ever knowing about it makes me want to use it even more.\n\nIf it\u2019s peer approval you\u2019re after in the forms of \u201clikes\u201d or \u201creshares\u201d Rando will infuriate you.\n\nSince launch the ability to delete images from your streams has found its way into Rando, something I\u2019d recommend doing because, in the absence of any way to view or select images en masse, the two streams can quickly become cumbersomely long.\n\nRando refers to itself as \u201can experimental\u00a0photo exchange platform\u201d. It remains to be seen how many people will take to, and more importantly stick to, the service \u2014 I find I forget about it for weeks at a time \u2014 but there\u2019s no doubt closed social sharing services are on the rise and people are increasingly interested in their own privacy. Suddenly, anonymity is sexy again. \u00a0\u2014 CW\n\nAbove: a timelapse of two Rando billboards being put up (presumably, going on the busses) in London, bearing the peculiar messages \u201cYou have no friends\u201d and \u201cNo one likes you\u201d respectively.\n\nNo Comments\n\nPost a Comment\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Informal and flexible presentation, but didn't get bogged down\n12910502Surprised it didn't get boring at all. 4 hrs is usually a long time to sit and listen.\n12910683I'm not an Oracle DBA and therefore I was concerned about the content of the workshop, however I was pleasantly surprised how business & architecture oriented the content was. It was a great session and I found it very valuable. Thank you!\n12915027I really enjoyed. Frank is obviously an expert in his field so it was well worth the time to spend listening to him on this very current topic.\n12926050Time well spent.\n12926174Fantastic :-) I should have googled about Frack before getting down there and should have asked my collegue to do so. I thoughly enjoyed. It should have been for a day.

Direct the lights with a finger.\n\n  \u2022 New handcrafted Frames tool. Pinch to adjust the frame size.\n\n  \u2022 New design let you edit quicker and easier than ever\n\n  \u2022 New adjustments tool with faster and more robust experience\n\n  \u2022 New direct sharing to Flickr\n\n  \u2022 Full support of Exif data\n\nThe ability to preserve Exif data (your photo\u2019s metadata including gps, resolution, time of day etc) really is a great addition and for those iPhoneographers out there who like to move their images from app to app making more and more refinements without having this stripped, this is most welcome.\n\nThe Spotlight filters which are available as a $1.99 IAP (in-app purchase) are pretty neat and offer an intuitive way of highlighting an area of importance in your scene, but subtle they ain\u2019t, so how often you will actually want to use them is another question:\n\nRepix 1.3 adds new spotlight filters.\nRepix 1.3 adds new spotlight filters.\n\nThe feature that sets this app apart from the hundred of other photo editing apps for iOS is the fx brushes and these really are pretty amazing. Now these are not image adjustment brushes like those found in iPhoto for example, but are entirely effects based so this is an app for creative experimentation rather than every day image adjustments\/correction.\n\nSome brushes are included in the free version of the app but others are available as in-app purchases with the following pricing:\n\nTop In-App Purchases\n\n  1. Light Brushes$1.99\n\n  2. Master\u2019s Collection$4.99\n\n  3. Jazzy Filters$0.99\n\n  4. Spotlights Filters$1.99\n\n  5. Artistic Brushes$1.99\n\n  6. Color Brushes$1.99\n\n  7. Grunge Brushes$1.99\n\nAs IAP go, for the money you do get some really useful tools, and Repix allows you to test each fully before purchasing to make sure you really want it, something we wish all developers would do, so kudos to the developers for this.\n\nThe app is intuitive with a very short learning curve and breaks the editing options into 5 distinct categories:\n\n  1.

Having said this they were few and far between.\n\nAlso the maximum export resolution is 11.2 megapixels. We tested this by importing a 21mpx image from a Canon 5D mkii and edited it which was smooth and snappy, but it was down-sized upon export. With other editing apps like Handy Photo supporting up to 32mpx images, we hope Repix will increase the export size in the next update.\n\nOverall this is a great app an example of what makes the iOS platform great for creative artist. We can easily recommend it and will give it 4\/5\n\nRepix - Inspiring Photo Editor - Sumoing Ltd\n\n\nLeave a Reply",

This timestamp app is a great way to add pertinent details to your trips and photos. Even better, it's a very simple to use date stamp app that will ensure you always know when and where you took a specific picture.\u00a0\n\nThe best iPhone apps for photo editing\n\nI prefer to have these details\u00a0turned on for my iPhone's camera\u00a0and I have been looking for an easy to use date and time stamp app that will do this on my iDevice. I believe that this app hits the mark.\u00a0\n\nTimestamp It - Make your Photos Memorable\n\n\nKnow When You Took Your Photos\n\nTimeStamp It is a date and time stamp app that allows you to take the photo straight from the app, or look it up afterwards. You can additionally put in a caption such as the location, your family vacation, or whatever else you\u2019d like.\n\nBest iphone and ipad apps\n\nI am an organized person, and really like this app because I no longer have to guess at when my photos were taken. My iPhone has quickly become my primary camera, and now sharing photos including when they were taken has become much easier.\n\nI also enjoy the caption option. Often you will be out and about on vacation, and forget which photos are from which location when you are visiting several castle ruins, for example. This is so easily fixed with this app because you not only have the date to look up and figure out where you were, but you can also add a caption like \u201cNorth side of the Castle of Joe Black\u201d or whatever will forever be stamped on your photo.\n\nIf you prefer to be able to cut it off for developing for some reason, then just make sure it is on the side of the landscape that will be cropped off.\n\nKnow When You Took Your Photos image\n\n\nAs mentioned above TimeStamp It allows you to put the date, time, and caption on your photo. There are six color options for your stamp to stand out: white, slate grey, blue, red, green, and yellow. You can move the caption, and you are supposed to be able to adjust the font, but after purchasing the add-on for $0.99 I couldn\u2019t get the ads off to access this feature.\n\nTo adjust the size of the stamp if it appears to be too small, large, or you need it to fit a specific spot, you just pinch your fingers as you would to zoom in to a photo in your Camera Roll.\n\nThe app saves your dated photo in your Camera Roll as a new image, so you won\u2019t lose the original unstamped image. If you wanted to print the photo for a frame, this would be handy, otherwise you can just delete the unstamped one at your leisure.\n\nFeatures image\n\nTimestamp It - Make your Photos Memorable\n\n\nPros & Cons\n\n\n  \u2022 Free\n  \u2022 Remove ads for $0.99\n  \u2022 Six colors to choose the most visible one for your photo, such as white for dark photos or slate for snowy photos\n  \u2022 Easy to use\n  \u2022 Saves directly to your Camera Roll as a new photo\n  \u2022 Select your album for narrowing down photos\n  \u2022 Share to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and more from app\n  \u2022 Set date and time in the order you want or no time at all\n\n\n  \u2022 Settings not always accessible\n\nPros & Cons image\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nTimeStamp It - Make Your Photos Memorable is an iPhone and iPad app that will put a time and date stamp on your photo to help you remember when you took photos, and with the use of the caption feature the location or event too.\n\nI have been waiting for Apple to add a date stamp option to the camera feature, but this app helps. Overall, it\u2019s easy to use, and does the trick.\n\nTimestamp It - Make your Photos Memorable\n\nShare this article:",

I love video chats in Skype, Facebook, Oovoo, and Google + Hangout. The trouble with video chatting is the fact there is a long delay and it\u2019s not a so cool experience if you got to wait for the person to pause while they are talking to get the full message. In this Glide App Review I am going to share with you my story of how it all started and show you how to download and use this app for personal conversation and in business.\n\nHow I discovered the Glide App\n\nLate one night while I was chilling on my bed I was messing around inside the Google Playstore, you know the area on your Android that houses all the free and paid apps for your smartphone. Well, while waiting for Rich to come home from work he was texting me alot that night and I text him back asking him if he was in the car texting while driving.\n\nOf course, he said, I am texting you because I miss you and want to see what your up to. Okay, so like I have a real problem with that as it\u2019s really totally not safe to text and drive. I felt uneasy knowing he was texting me and driving at night tired from working in the field all day. This was my motivation as I had enough of this texting and really wanted to see his face and talk to him so I started searching under the keyword Video Chat in the Google Playstore.\n\nThe results that came up were 1. oovoo, 2. Tango, 3. Skype, 4. Camfrog Video Chat, 5. Video Chat by FriendCaller, 6. Paltalk Video Chat Free, 7. TK Video chat for Facebook, 8. Rounds Video Chat, and 9. Glide App -Video Texting. How interesting as I was scrolling down with my finger I dug up this holy grail of video texting and I didn\u2019t realize how powerful it can be. I pressed the app and reviewed the reviews first of course before downloading it and then I watched the preview video commercial and that is what sold me!\n\nThis is definitely the app I was searching for so I can stay connected with the love of my life Rich Guzman and it\u2019s completely safer than texting while driving. Now we see eachother every day while he is traveling and doing business at the same time I am making his day and he is making my day feel great. Suddenly, a friend of mine on Facebook asked what the heck is Glide Video Texting? and that is when I thought ooh! I could also share this app for fun with my online buddies, friends, and customers to stay in real-time connection with me like a walkie-talkie but with video. Soo Cool! to talk to a Facebook new or old connection that I haven\u2019t talked or chatted with since 2008 and see their face and hear their voice as if I am right there in the room with them. \u00a0Awesome! way to establish and build relationships online.\n\nYou can download Glide to your smartphone to communicate with us here.\n\nWhat is Glide App-Video Texting\n\n(Demo on iPhone) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Demo on Android)\n\nFounded and created by an Israeli communication company, Glide Talk. (Pretty neat name) This technology had the attention of two special and powerful men in the technology industry. The project raised up to $2 million dollars and thanks to the contribution of these two men who funded the project former ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger CEO, Orey Gilliam and Philippe Schwartz, founder and CEO of OoVoo instant messaging.\nFirst of all, Glide App is an awesome free video messenger android app that will allow anyone who downloads it to send each other short video chat messages that can be seen live in real-time conversation or later on if you missed it. The Glide App has a special chime that lets the user know there is a message incoming as well. Even though Glide Video Texting is new it\u2019s still patent pending with a few delays and bugs but it works great with Wifi and 4G areas.\n\nGlide App Video Texting is currently available to use in connection to your Facebook, but the founders have announced recently that new updates are coming soon where it will be integrated on other most popular social networks. All the videos you record are saved and stored in a cloud based technology and you can always re-play them later to catch up on missed video calls. The Glide App has unlimited talk and unlimited text so unlike Twitter where you limited to 140 characters right\u2026this doesn\u2019t have that and you can send longer conversation text to your companion or friend.\n\n\nHow to Start A Chat on Glide App in Android\n\nHow to Start A Group Chat In Android\n\nHow to Refresh Your Page If It Get\u2019s Stuck\n\nHow to Delete A Video Text Message\n\nHow to Leave A Conversation And Return To Home Screen\n\nPros to having Glide App Video Texting\n\nHere are the pros to having this kind of app:\n\n  \u2022 Safer to than texting and you can show yourself hanging out with the family or at a business meeting rather than text \u201cHey, I am at a meeting today!\u201d\n  \u2022 Faster than instant messaging with just a tap of your finger, send a instant video text message to your friend or client even if offline.\n  \u2022 There is no need to wait for a green available light icon that tells you your contact is a online to talk like in Oovoo and Skype\n  \u2022 Great conversation starter with old friends you haven\u2019t spoken to in a long time.\n  \u2022 You can create group chats of unlimited size.\n  \u2022 No need to upload videos or download a video message.\n  \u2022 Cloud technology so no need to take up data space.\n  \u2022 Re-play saved videos anytime.\n  \u2022 Now available for iPhone and Android users. 100% Free!\n\nCons to having Glide App Video Texting\n\nHere is what I found to be the cons to this app:\n\n  \u2022 Not compatible with all phones especially it doesn\u2019t have iOS app\u2019s function such as the flip of the camera.\n  \u2022 Currently available for Facebook account users and syncs with all of your friends and contacts with your permission.\n  \u2022 Must be in a Wifi area or 4G as the better the signal the best recordings.\n\n\nMy final conclusion with the Glide App Video Texting download is that I have been using this for over a month and I am totally addicted that now I use it for personal to stay in contact with friends and family as well as for business communication. \u00a0How do you like the Glide App so far?\n\nAnastacia Hauldridge & Rich Guzman\n\n\nIf You\u2019re Struggling To Generate Leads & Sign-Ups in Your MLM, Direct Sales or Affiliate Business\u2026 CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO WATCH MY FREE TRAINING.

But I was never into music theory much.\n\nI tend to just try and see what sounds good. That works for me, but I also recognize it kind of limits the things I come up with.\n\nSo here is the Scaler creative chord composer, a plugin that aims to help you find chords and progressions with ease.\n\nAs you can see in the welcome screen above, Scaler can help you in several ways.\n\n  \u2022 Detect what key and scale you are in by playing some notes\/chords.\n  \u2022 Explore tons of scales and chord sets from various genres and artists.\n  \u2022 Create, edit, save and export your own chord sets.\n\nSo let\u2019s say you have a melody or some chords you want to work with. While in detect mode, Scaler shows what you play (which can also be a MIDI sequence in your DAW) and lists matching scales.\n\nThe plugin comes with a few built-in sounds, but you can also route it to another virtual instrument as well.\n\nThe amount of notes and chords that match a particular scale is displayed. In case multiple scales match your input, you can check the scale style description of each of the scales to determine what suits you best.\n\nOnce you select a scale, the Scale Explorer will show the diatonic chords for said scale. Chord variations allow you to navigate through the degrees of the scale, with all chord variations by note.\n\nYou can give your progression more character by using substitutions as well. Furthermore you can navigate 12 predefined voicings that fit the selected scale.\n\nMoving to the bottom of the interface we find the progression builder. Simply drag and drop chords in the slots and play them or export the MIDI to your DAW.\n\nSince the version 1.1 update of Scaler you can also record the output directly to a MIDI track, which is great because the regular MIDI export simply dumps the chords with a preset note length and velocity.\n\nNote that not all hosts support the pass-through recording though. In FL Studio, for instance, you\u2019ll need to use a MIDI loopback device.\n\nThe builder has controls for changing the octave and inversion of chords, and you can save your own chord sets. With the bind MIDI buttons in the interface you can play chords with a single note, and at the same time play bass or melody.\n\nAnother way to find chords is by simply exploring scales.\n\nSelect notes or scale types, or check some of the songs in a wide variety of genres and contributions by artists, including Carl Cox, Josh Abrahams, MJ Cole, and more.\n\nWith the onboard bank of 1,728 scales and modes including genre and artist presets, there\u2019s more than enough to keep the juices flowing.\n\nScaler is available for Windows and Mac (VST\/AU\/AA), priced at \u00a339.95 GBP.\n\nSo what do I think?\n\nI am really impressed by Scaler. It took only a few minutes from launching it the first time to coming up with a nice chord progression.\n\nYou might think things get complicated with so many scales and voicings, but in fact Scaler is incredibly easy to work with. This plugin is likely going to speed up your workflow, boost creativity, and educate you along the way.\n\nDo yourself a favour and check out the free demo, I think you\u2019re going to like it!\n\nReview Overview\n\n  \u2022 Features - 4.5 \/ 5\n  \u2022 Ease of use - 5 \/ 5\n  \u2022 Value - 4.5 \/ 5\n\nSummary - 4.7 \/ 5\n\nScaler is a brilliant tool for anyone looking to create chord progressions. Great workflow, intuitive and easy to use!\n\nOriginal Source -\n\nTry before you buy\n\nDownload Scaler trial version for free!\n\nOther Plugin Boutique products\n\n  \u2022 hot!\n  \u2022 award\n  \u2022 bundle\n620x320 scalerbundle new pluginboutique\nyour price$59.00\n  \u2022 hot!\n  \u2022 award\n  \u2022 bundle\n620x320 scaleradvancedbundle new pluginboutique\nyour price$69.00\n  \u2022 hot!\n  \u2022 sale\n  \u2022 top rated\n620 x 320 pib sylenth cinematic downtempo pluginboutique\nyour price$9.50",

        "text":"Product Information\n\nSaint Saint Suite\n\n\nby Peter Stephenson May 01, 2009\n\n\n\nSaint Suite\n\n\n\n$2,695 for a Class C\n\n\n  \u2022 Features:\n  \u2022 Ease of Use:\n  \u2022 Performance:\n  \u2022 Documentation:\n  \u2022 Support:\n  \u2022 Value for Money:\n  \u2022 Overall Rating:\n\n\n  \u2022 Strengths: Full-featured vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.\n  \u2022 Weaknesses: Documentation could be stronger, especially for a product of this type.\n  \u2022 Verdict: A top performer with a solid pedigree.\nThe SAINT scanner and penetration testing software is just what it says it is. This product does not only do vulnerability scanning across a vast number of platforms, as well as routers and basically anything else with an IP address, but it can also try to exploit and penetrate those vulnerabilities using a penetration tool. This provides an all-around overview of network vulnerabilities.\n\nWe installed the product in just minutes on our Fedora Core 6 machine and we were ready to go. The interface of the console is easy to use and intuitive to navigate. The only place where we found ourselves a little confused was in creating the license key. The key is created by logging into the Saint website, filling out a form, and then saving the HTML page as a .key file and putting it into the Saint directory. This seems like an awfully lengthy process just for a license key.\n\nHowever, the rest of the product is a solid performer. Setting up and running the scans is easy and scans can be customized in various ways. After a scan ran, we were able to go directly to a full set of pre-defined reports and report templates. From there, reports could be created quickly and easily.\n\nDocumentation is a single PDF document that provides information for the product from installation through using and configuring its features. While this document is well organized and easy to follow there are no real visuals or step-by-step instructions. It is written in paragraph format and at times it can be difficult to extract how to use the product.\n\nSaint provides 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. phone and email technical support included in the base price. Customers can also get 24\/7 support at an additional cost of 10 percent of the product price. There is also a large support area on the website.\n\nAt a price just under $2,700 for a full Class C license, we find this product to be an excellent value for the money. It provides not only vulnerability scanning, but also penetration testing, along with an easy-to-use console. We have watched this product evolve from a freeware product ages ago. If the documents were a bit more complete, this would have been a top contender.\n\nSign up to our newsletters",

But, don\u2019t take it from us, take it from them!\n\nHere are a few 5 star reviews from our Chrome Webstore:\n\nI love WiseStamp, and their support team. The moment I needed help, they were on it immediately and sorted it for me at the speed of light! Not to mention how professional and memorable my emails now are\u2026 great way to be remembered as a person and as a pro. Highly recommend it to everybody! \u2013\u00a0Gianluca G.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been using WiseStamp Pro for about six months now and love it! I have everything set up for my business, so all my emails are sent with FREE advertising of my business. And of course, the expense can be written off on my taxes as an advertising expense. Win-win situation. Support is top-notch, responding almost immediately, or at least within 24 hours at most. Sure beats trying to make up my own signature file that was blah, blah, blah! \u2013\u00a0Cathryn P.\n\n\nI love my Wisestamp! I have 4 different signatures that I\u2019ve created to use and it was so easy. Also, when I\u2019ve needed help they\u2019ve been great and very helpful. \u2013\u00a0Janeen B.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been using it for several weeks now with no problems Love it and it makes my emails look a million times more professional. I\u2019m using the free version, with Gmail. (As I was writing this I suddenly decided to upgrade to the PRO version, that\u2019s how much I like this program.) I\u2019m very busy re-branding myself and this tool is helping me immensely in that effort. \u2013\u00a0Eric D.\n\n\nI LOVE how professional my Wisestamp signature looks and how quick & easy it is to update. Most of all, the support team is friendly and very accommodating. \u2013 Maria F.\n\n\nThis is my second year using wisestamp and I am hooked. The personal branding options are first class.\nI did encounter a couple of hiccups but support always responds (via email) in a timely and personal manner.\nThe pro-version is a wise investment (in your branding to use WiseStamp. \u2013 John C.\n\nUpdated on November 21, 2016\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\nAll rights reserved WiseStamp 2018\n[contact-form-7 id=\"380\" title=\"contact\"]",

Putting it near the bottom of the options tab would be a useful place for it. ;) I keep forgetting the keys and keep having to search for them.Otherwise it's an excellent extension.\n\nInformation to BlueBerry938:\n\nIt does work like the pictures suggest. You can even watch a video to see how it works. Click the toolbar icon and the available emoticons will show in a sidebar where you can double click them to insert into the text area.\n\nOr type the assigned shortcut into the text area and press the convert key (Ctrl+Shift+F) to replace the shortcut with the image.\n\nIt works perfectly and it's an excellent extension.\n\nThis user has 2 previous reviews of this add-on.",
