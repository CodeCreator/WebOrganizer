I am very satisfied with new Windows Live Messenger, its lets you to chat and share folders and files with friend that are using Yahoo IM. The only thing that i don't like is that there is unnecessarily extra stuff. But there is several very good games that you can play whit you friends (Tic-Tac-Toe Classic, Solitaire Show Down, Checkers, Bejeweled, Minesweeper Flags, and more). Like the previous the chat window is full customizable so you can pick a color scheme or choose from themes. There is option that allow user to connect services such as Facebook, Linkedln and MySpace using Windows Live Profile. There is several improvements since Messenger 7. The sounds are way better then the last version and it have a new sleek look whit a nice pattern up the top.\n\nFollow Us\n\nCopyright VIRTUALSOFT.COM \u00a9 2011 - All rights reserved - Privacy Policy - Terms of Service - About Us",

Sort by Price (desc) doesn't work.\n\nWhat's the point... If it doesn't work?\n\nGetting stuck at the checkout page\nBy , for WP 4.2.2\n\nWoo commerce looks a very nice plugin but fails to do a very important task for me- accepting payments. On my website, which uses Customizr theme and a Payu money plugin with woo commerce, the check out page will keep on loading. Some other users has also reported the issue, I read through forum but could not find any solution.\n\nHas some problems\nBy , for WP 4.2.2\n\nThis is a good plugin for selling your products. Posting your products is easy. It works!\n\nHowever,I have multiple problems with this plugin. Changing images in the CSS is confusing and takes at least multiple hours. Even with just getting the buttons to line up is a hassle. I have at least 3 other plugins just to make up for what Woocommerce is lacking.\n\nSetting up the shipping is a little easier, but it does not show on your website shipping if you have shipping built into your paypal (I need to look at a plugin for this).\n\nAlso the support is horrendous. Two WEEKS ago, I posted a question regarding the shipping, and no one replied until yesterday. And it wasn't even the plugin creator.\n\nOverall I'm not too thrilled with it, but I've already set up all my products(500+) and am not sure if they would move over into a different ecommerce plugin. We've already put so much work into what we've done and I would hate to lose it all.\n\nGoog job\nBy ,\n\nThank you to the developer, excellent plugin.\n\nVery useful free plugin\nBy , for WP 4.2.2\n\nThank you to the developer, excellent plugin. If for somebody the alignment of the pictures does not work, just use their storefront theme.

        "text":"28 reviews for this add-on\n  \u2022 Doesn't work. It says \"There is no time yet recorded today\". This is your first visit on this site today. I have at least 10 tabs on this site today. It says that a possible cause is that I didn't use my computer for enough time today, but that's not true. Whatever the duration, it shows the same thing. And on the site: \"There is no time logged for this period\".\n  \u2022 Doesn't work with firefox developer edition. RescueTime shows everything under \"firefox developer edition\" activity without displaying visited websites.\n\n    Tested with firefox developer edition 64.0b6 and latest RescueTime under Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS\n  \u2022 Worked like a charm!\n  \u2022 It helps you be productive\n  \u2022 doesn't work\n  \u2022 Simply does not work. Very disappointing for paying members.\n  \u2022 Still doesn't work on Firefox Developer Edition. The *title\/name* of the page is shown individually, but the *site address* isn't actually identified! All my activities are lumped together under \"Firefox Developer Edition\". The customer support has also been totally unhelpful on solving the issue.\n\n    Strangely it does work on Firefox.\n  \u2022 Don\u00b4t use this addon, mines your data as you can read in it\u00b4s policy.\n  \u2022 Excelente aplicacion que me ayuda a ser conciente en ue uso mi tiempo\n  \u2022 After a long time, I can finally confirm it is working on macOS and Firefox with a cookie whitelist (cookies disabled by default, only user-specified pages are allowed to set cookies). Thanks to the developer to create an actual support document for this edge case.\n\n    If you are a Firefox user who likes to whitelist cookies instead of accepting everything by default, here is your guide:\n  \u2022 Simple, concise, works well, helps me saving time\n  \u2022 Works well in standard Firefox Quantum 58.0b3, but not track sites in Firefox Developer Edition 58.0b5. I tested addon on Kubuntu 17.10.\n    Are you using the add-on in standalone mode, or in conjunction with the RescueTime desktop app for Linux? If the latter, please make sure you have the latest version: https:\/\/www.rescuetime.com\/get_rescuetime\n  \u2022 Since Firefox 57 I've switched over from Chrome. This extension initially did not log correctly even though the notes here said it added support for Firefox 57. However, I recently received an update to my rescuetime OSX app and now everything works perfectly as expected. Thanks rescuetime. This is now a 5 star extension.\n  \u2022 Best way to keep track of what you actually get up to on the internet all dang day - warning: may be eye opening.\n  \u2022 Using the latest 57.0b9 on both standard and developer editions of Firefox for Mac, after installing the RescueTime add-on I can link it to my account just fine, and if I click on the icon in the toolbar the summary does correctly identify which site I'm on.\n\n    *But* it never logs any time on these sites. If I visit a site I've not seen in Chrome that day it always reports it as being my first visit. If I visit a site I've seen in Chrome it reports the previous total time spent there but never increments.\n    If you're using the add-on in conjunction with the RescueTime desktop app, you'll need to make sure you have the latest version of the desktop app for the recent add-on updates to function properly.\n\n  \u2022 can't track browser time\n  \u2022 Causes problems with e10s and will stop working in Fx 57, need to be ported to WebExtensions.\n  \u2022 After install, icon is not showed on the bar. One need to go do adjusting options and drag icon onto the bar. Then click it and it works.\n  \u2022 If you're encountered the problem mentioned in a number of these reviews where you attempt to login to the RescueTime add-on and you can't type in the email field, the work around from the add-on developer is mentioned here ( https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-us\/firefox\/addon\/rescuetime-for-firefox\/reviews\/804290\/ ) stating \"We've been able to reproduce the issue. As far as we can tell, the problem with not being able to interact with the window ONLY happens when the RescueTime icon located on the menu panel (under the hamburger icon on the far end of the toolbar). If the RescueTime icon is directly on the browser toolbar, the window works. While we work on a fix, the workaround is to move the icon to the browser toolbar. If you do not want the icon on the toolbar, you can put it there temporarily, sign in, then move it back to the menu panel and the site tracking should work just fine.\"\n  \u2022 Just like the others complain... it does not pop up after install.\n\n    Glitch in the system and I am surprised that the DEV with such low ratings.. is not fixing this issue.\n  \u2022 It causes issues with other extensions (Tab Groups in my case) because it has not been updated to work with multi-process Firefox.\n  \u2022 After adding the extension button to the toolbar I was able to click the button, log in, and start tracking.\n\n    My only wish is a, user definable, option to combine websites and apps as one. For example, I'd like messenger.com from the web and Facebook Messenger from Android to be counted as the same RescueTime Activity.\n  \u2022 It works just fine. Remember to put the icon somewhere visible after installing by going to \"customize\" on Firefox. Signed in without issues.\n  \u2022 Would be great if it worked. It didn't.\nPage 1 of 2",
