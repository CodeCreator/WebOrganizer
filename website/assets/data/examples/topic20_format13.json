        "text":"Smart SEO Hosting\n\nSmart SEO Hosting Explains the Benefits of HTTP\/2 for SEO\n\nConsidering major benefits to site performance and support by Google, SEO experts believe HTTP\/2 should be the used by all serious online businesses.\n\n\nSan Jose, CA -- (SBWIRE) -- 03\/14\/2016 -- Smart SEO Hosting, a multiple industry award winner, encourages all its clients to move to HTTP\/2 from HTTP\/1.1. This announcement is in line with the 2 new major upgrades in their global networks that provides Free SSL and Free HTTP\/2 migrations.\n\nGoogle search engine team has previously mentioned their intention to change Googlebot protocol to HTTP\/2 by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Considering the fact that HTTP\/2 is backward compatible there is no risk in migrating to the new protocol while the obvious performance boosts provided by the new protocol should impact SEO ranking of sites that provide their contents on the new and more advanced protocol.\n\nMoving to the new protocol is something that has to be done on the web server level and should be enabled on SSL layer. Although HTTP\/2 is not specifically designed for HTTPS, all major browsers only support this protocol on an encrypted channel. As a result it is important that the websites that want to benefit from this protocol have to already be on HTTPS.\n\nSince January 2016 Smart SEO Hosting has been providing free SSL certificates to all its clients and for as long as they stay as their active clients which should provide a good base for any migration to HTTP\/2.\n\nSince February 2016 all SSL clients of Smart SEO Hosting has already been moved to HTTP\/2 automatically and free of any charges. Majority of those clients have already seen a better and faster user experience and boost in their search engine results ranking.\n\nIt is important to remember that for browsers that do not support HTTP\/2 the protocol automatically switches back to HTTP\/1.1 making it comp lately transparent and backward compatible with old browsers.\n\nAbout Smart SEO Hosting \u00a0is a dedicated and professional SEO hosting company that provides services to SEO agencies in USA, Europe and Australia. The company offers variety of hosting plans for different countries, ISPs and IP classes. The company operates from more than 120 data centers scattered across the globe. To accommodate further SEO needs, now offers hosting on IPs and load balancers that are owned and operated by Google itself.",

        "text":"HomeNews EventsPress ReleasesOnline Trust Alliance Reports Doubling of Cyber Incidents in 2017\n\nOnline Trust Alliance Reports Doubling of Cyber Incidents in 2017\n\nThu, Jan 25, 2018\n\nReston, VA \u2013 The Online Trust Alliance (OTA), an Internet Society initiative with the mission to enhance online trust, today released its Cyber Incident & Breach Trends Report. OTA\u2019s annual analysis found that cyber incidents targeting businesses nearly doubled from 82,000 in 2016 to 159,700 in 2017. Since the majority of cyber incidents are never reported, OTA believes the actual number in 2017 could easily exceed 350,000.\n\nIn the report, OTA analyzes data breaches, ransomware targeting businesses, business email compromise (BEC), distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), and takeover of critical infrastructure and physical systems over the course of a year. It highlights the Internet Society\u2019s concerns around how large-scale data breaches, uncertainties about how data is being used, cybercrime and other online threats are impacting Internet users\u2019 trust in the Internet.\n\n\u201cSurprising no one, 2017 marked another \u2018worst year ever\u2019 in data breaches and cyber incidents around the world,\u201d said Jeff Wilbur, director of the OTA initiative at the Internet Society. \u201cThis year\u2019s big increase in cyberattacks can be attributed to the skyrocketing instances of ransomware and the bold new methods of criminals using this attack.\u201d\n\nOTA found that in 2017 there were 134,000 ransomware attacks on businesses, nearly doubling that of 2016. In mid-2017 another type of ransomware attack emerged\u2014the ransom denial-of-service attack (RDoS). In this attack, criminals send an email to domain owners threatening a DDoS attack that will make a website inoperable unless a ransom (usually via Bitcoin) is paid. OTA recommends proactive planning for crisis management, forensics specialists and law enforcement, and suggests that organizations be prepared by setting up a Bitcoin wallet in the event ransom payment is deemed necessary for a given incident.\n\nBreaches Easily Avoidable\nAs in past years, OTA found most breaches could have been easily prevented. It calculated that in 2017, 93 percent of all breaches could have been avoided had simple steps been taken such as regularly updating software, blocking fake email messages using email authentication and training people to recognize phishing attacks. Of the reported breaches in 2017, OTA found 52 percent were the result of actual hacks, 15 percent were due to lack of proper security software, 11 percent were due to physical skimming of credit cards, 11 percent were due to a lack of internal controls preventing employees\u2019 negligent or malicious actions and eight percent were due to phishing attacks.\n\n\u201cRegular patching has always been a best practice and neglecting it is a known cause of many breaches, but this received special attention in 2017 in light of the Equifax breach,\u201d said Wilbur. \u201cIn 2018 we expect patches to play an even more integral role due to the recently discovered Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities where nearly every computer chip manufactured in the last 20 years was found to contain fundamental security flaws.\u201d\n\nOTA came to its conclusions in the report by tracking and analyzing threat intelligence data from multiple sources. These sources included but are not limited to Cybersecurity Ventures, the FBI, Malwarebytes, the Ponemon Institute, Proofpoint, Risk Based Security, Symantec and Verizon.\n\nThis report, released in recognition of Data Privacy & Protection Day on Jan. 28, is a precursor to OTA\u2019s tenth annual Cyber Incident & Breach Response Guide\u00a0to be released in the coming months. The guide provides organizations with tools to enhance data protection, adopt responsible privacy practices and help to detect, mitigate and effectively respond to a cyber incident.\n\nAbout OTA:\u00a0\n\nThe Online Trust Alliance (OTA) is a non-profit with the mission to enhance online trust and user empowerment while promoting innovation and the vitality of the Internet. Its goal is to help educate businesses, policy makers and stakeholders while developing and advancing best practices and tools to enhance the protection of users' security, privacy and identity. OTA supports collaborative public-private partnerships, benchmark reporting, and meaningful self-regulation and data stewardship. Its members and supporters include leaders spanning the public policy, technology, ecommerce, social networking, mobile, email and interactive marketing, financial, service provider, government agency and industry organization sectors.",

        "text":"Skip to content\n\nPreparedness means planning, and there are tools to help\n\nPar Molly Bull, Senior Communications Manager, Microsoft Disaster Response le octobre 2, 2016\n\nArchiv\u00e9 sous Gouvernement\n\nFall is finally here, and as we close out September\u2014National Preparedness Month \u2014it\u2019s the perfect time for governments and citizens to be thinking about how to survive a disaster, give aid to others in need, and stay in touch with family and friends when traditional communications are disrupted.\n\nBeing aware of the challenges you might face, planning for how you will meet them, and sharing these plans with family and others are the first steps in preparedness, and there are a number of resources to help you get started. The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s website is a good place to start.\n\nThere are also personal digital tools that provide practical help with planning in advance and most of us have the power in our hands, literally, to put this technology to work. Today\u2019s smartphones have the power to support applications and services that can make us better prepared for emergencies as well as to make everyday life more convenient.\n\nHelpBridge is a free mobile app for Windows, Android, and iOS phones to connect people with family and community through a single message sent to a pre-selected contact group. In either a minor event such as a flat tire or in a natural disaster, the app uses email, texting, Twitter and Facebook to let others know whether you need help or are okay, and where you are through GPS coordinates if you choose to use that option.\n\nStaying in touch during a disaster can be a challenge when traditional infrastructure is damaged or overloaded. Digital alternatives such as texting can be more effective than standard voice, but there also are digital voice and video options that you can use. With the Skype mobile app you can use your smartphone to stay in touch when a computer is unavailable or hard to get to.\n\nThe cloud can give you and others access to critical information from almost any type of device or location, so that it remains available whatever the conditions around you. A OneDrive account gives you 15 GB of storage for cloud backup of important documents and files; everything from wills to videos to family photos. HealthVault lets you store, access and share personal medical information.\n\nMany of the applications and tools you use every day to make your life more convenient also can be leveraged during an emergency to provide you with the information and services you need to overcome disaster and to help others. The key to taking advantage of them is planning ahead so that you have the tools and information in place when you need them. It is never too later\u2014or too early\u2014to begin planning.\n\nTo learn more about Microsoft Disaster Response visit or follow@msftresponse and the hashtag #NatlPrep.\n\nMolly Bull\nSenior Communications Manager, Microsoft Disaster Response\n\nUseful Links",
