        "text":"Introducing Telerivet for iOS and Android\n\nWe are very excited to announce that Telerivet is now available as an app for iPhones and iPads, as well as Android phones and tablets.\n\nYou can use the app to send and schedule broadcasts, view and edit contacts, manage automated services, and more.\u00a0Almost anything you can do from your web browser, you can do on the go.\n\nIn addition, the iOS and Android apps let you get (optional) notifications of incoming messages. If someone sends a text message to your virtual number, you can read the message and reply directly from your phone.\n\nSince Telerivet runs in the cloud, you can switch back and forth between the smartphone app and the web dashboard at any time.\n\nWhen using the app, text messages and voice calls are sent and received via third-party providers such as Nexmo, not via your personal phone. When you send SMS messages or calls from the app, your contacts will see your organization\u2019s sender or caller ID (as configured in your Telerivet account), not your personal phone number.\n\nThe iPhone and iPad app supports iOS 10.0 and above. The Android app works on Android 4.4 or above.\n\nTo try it out, install the app on your phone below:\n\nTwo Telerivet Android apps\n\nAs you may know, Telerivet already had an Android app that turns an Android phone into a SMS gateway in any country.\u00a0 The new Android app, however, does not turn your phone into an SMS gateway.\n\nTelerivet\u2019s original SMS gateway app is still available, and it will continue to be supported and developed. There are just two separate Telerivet Android apps now because they serve different purposes.\n\nTo avoid confusion between the two Telerivet Android apps,\u00a0the original Telerivet Android app has been renamed to \u201cTelerivet Gateway\u201c. The Telerivet Gateway app lets you use Telerivet to send and receive SMS messages in any country via that Android phone\u2019s SIM card. Typically, users will dedicate a phone specifically for the Telerivet Gateway app, and won\u2019t use it as a normal mobile phone.\n\nThe main screen of the Telerivet Gateway app:\n\nOn the other hand, the new Android app is named \u201cTelerivet Mobile\u201c. Telerivet Mobile lets you access Telerivet\u2019s mobile messaging platform from your phone, and receive notifications. Telerivet Mobile is meant to be used on your personal mobile phone \u2014 and if you invite your team to use Telerivet, everyone can install Telerivet Mobile on their phones too. (There are no limits on the number of phones that can run the Telerivet Mobile app.)\n\nAny SMS messages that you send from the Telerivet Mobile app will be sent via the SMS gateway you have configured in your Telerivet account.\u00a0This may be a provider like Nexmo, or it could be an Android phone running the Telerivet Gateway app. (It is possible to run the Telerivet Mobile app and the Telerivet Gateway app on different Android phones, or the same phone.)\n\nWe\u2019re excited to hear your feedback on the new Android and iOS apps \u2014 let us know what you think at",

        "text":"Customers love to ask Alexa questions. Whether they\u2019re looking for the latest sports scores, struggling to remember the name of the actor in their favorite movie or hoping to settle a friendly dinner table debate, customers turn to Alexa daily to help them find the information they need.\n\nOur vision has always been that Alexa will be able to answer all questions in all forms, from anywhere in the world. Alexa is getting smarter every day\u2014she can now do millions of things, and just in the last year we added more than one billion data points to Alexa\u2019s knowledge, federating a large number of sources that inform our knowledge graph. This ensures Alexa offers high-quality answers for questions customers are asking the most, from sports scores to movie trivia.\n\nWhile Alexa can answer the vast majority of questions customers are asking every day, every once in a while, customers throw curve balls at us with various questions like \u201cWhere was Barbara Bush buried?\u201d or \u201cWho wrote the score for Lord of the Rings?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s cork made out of?\u201d or \u201cWhere do bats go in the winter?\u201d\n\nNow, in addition to advanced technology\u2014such as machine learning and natural language understanding\u2014and our many trustworthy information sources, we\u2019re involving the Alexa customer community to help us answer questions Alexa can\u2019t quite answer yet.\n\nBeginning today, via invitation-only, customers can add answers and information to Alexa through a new feature we call Alexa Answers. Those who receive an invite via email can start contributing answers to Alexa today. We're excited to get Alexa customers involved. In the last month, through our internal Alexa Answers beta program, we've added more than 100,000 responses which have been given to customers millions of times.\n\nFor nearly 20 years, we\u2019ve allowed customers to offer their input on product pages through customer reviews and community-based answers. Similarly, with Alexa Answers, now customers can help add facts to Alexa from which the tens of millions of customers in the Alexa community can benefit.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe Alexa Answers website allows invited customers to answer questions, asked by other customers, that Alexa currently does not know the answer to. Topics are varied and range from science to geography to music. Once on the website, customers can browse through topic categories, select a question that appeals to them, type their response, and click \"submit.\" After a customer submits the answer, the answer may be given to Alexa customers. Then, when the next customer asks Alexa the question answered by the community, Alexa will have access to that answer and can choose to respond by attributing the response to \u201can Amazon customer\u201d before providing the answer.\n\nExample questions customers may answer on Alexa Answers\n\n  \u2022 How many birds migrate?\n  \u2022 What is Juniper syrup?\n  \u2022 Where is the most snowfall?\n  \u2022 Where was the world\u2019s largest wave surfed?\n  \u2022 How long does it take for an ice cube tray to freeze?\n\nWe still have a way to go to achieve our vision of answering every question in all forms from anywhere in the world. But with the launch of Alexa Answers, we\u2019re excited to empower the Alexa community to make Alexa even more helpful and informative on behalf of customers.\n\nLearn more about all things Alexa.",

And, it\u2019s coming to Shopify.\n\nYou put lots of work into creating an enjoyable buying experience. But, multiple fields to complete at checkout can slow down your customers or even discourage them from making a purchase.

This feature will soon be automatically enabled on your store.\n\nType a few characters, it does the rest\n\nNow, when customers arrive at checkout and start entering the first few characters of their address, Google Autocomplete will instantly finish the job and pre-populate their address. Wrong addresses and re-typing are virtually eliminated.\n\nHere\u2019s what it looks like:\n\n\nSimple update delivers powerful benefits\n\nOur testing of Google Autocomplete showed an increase in conversion rate, and almost 20% time savings and error reduction on mobile. You save time by no longer dealing with incorrect addresses and the resulting problems, giving you more time for fulfilment and other business-building tasks.\n\nSuccess as a merchant means getting a million details right, and Shopify is continuously working on improving every single one of them for you.\n\nSuccess also means being able to give your customers the best possible experience during Black Friday Cyber Monday, and this update will help you do just that.\n\nTemplate Icon",

The tool provides signature update functionality and a dynamic graphical user interface, which was built using C#, SOAP and Web services on the framework.\n\n\"While companies have become increasingly vigilant about guarding their corporate networks from break-ins, they also need to be able to account for potential human errors with information inadvertently made visible on the Internet,\" said Mark Curphey, director of consulting for Foundstone Professional Services at McAfee, Inc. \"McAfee is committed to providing the necessary tools to safeguard personal and private information and the increased functionality of our SiteDigger tool helps companies protect private information that is mistakenly made available through their Web sites.\"\n\nSiteDigger 2.0 is one of many tools now available from McAfee's acquisition of the Foundstone technology to help define, design, develop, deploy and maintain reliable and secure software.

Today, we\u2019re adding a few features that make getting help from the Google Assistant even more convenient on your watch.\n\nContinue the conversation with smart suggestions\n\nWith smart suggestions from the Google Assistant, you\u2019ll be able to choose from contextually relevant follow up questions or responses to continue the conversation. For example, when you ask about the weather, you can see the weather now and then tap on a suggestion to see the extended forecast for the weekend. Perfect for quick interactions when you\u2019re on the go!\n\n\nHear answers to your questions\n\nSometimes it\u2019s easier to hear answers to your questions rather than read them. For example, if you\u2019re listening to music on your way to work, try asking the Google Assistant to \u201ctell me about my day.\u201d You\u2019ll hear some helpful information, like your commute times and upcoming agenda, from your watch speaker or Bluetooth headphones.\n\nGet more done from the convenience of your wrist\n\nA few months ago, we announced over 1 million Actions\u2014things you can do\u2014with the Google Assistant. Today we're bringing Actions to all Wear OS by Google watches, so you can use your voice to preheat your LG oven while you\u2019re unloading your groceries, ask Bay Trains when the next train is leaving, and more. Even better, we\u2019re always working with developers and partners to add more Actions and functionalities.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll start rolling out these new features over the next several days, so look out for the updates on your Wear OS by Google watch. And if you\u2019re a developer interested in building Actions that work with the Google Assistant on Wear OS by Google, tune into the live stream to check out our session at Google I\/O on May 9 at 10:30 am PT.\n\nLet\u2019s stay in touch.

One compromise and the entire network comes down, taking along with it your organization\u2019s reputation and credibility.\n\nSome of today\u2019s security threats and issues include:\n\n    \u2022 APTs or Advanced Persistent Threats: These creep into a network and spread in stealth mode. By the time they get detected, they\u2019ve spread across the entire network and done their damage.\n    \u2022 Privileged Accounts Mis-use: This is a common security issue with public clouds, where hackers gain access to privileged accounts, and steal sensitive information from various departments.\n    \u2022 Malicious Attachments: This is one the most common security issue where malicious email attachments are clicked by unsuspecting users, causing the malware to spread throughout the network.\n\nTypical Solutions\n\nSecurity therefore is a key strategic priority for enterprise today. CISOs have to answer to the board in most cases if their network gets compromised. That\u2019s why, they leave no stone unturned to keep their networks secure.\n\nTherefore, some typical solutions used by CISOs and security managers today are:\n\n    \u2022 The latest tools: Security managers must use a variety of tools like next-gen firewalls, IDS and IPSs to prevent the above issues.\n    \u2022 Network Segmentation: They must also do network segmentation using VLANs to avoid threats from spreading.\n    \u2022 Traffic Monitoring: They must monitor network traffic flowing in and out of business-critical applications across clouds to detect malicious activity.\n    \u2022 ACLs and firewall rules: they must keep updating the access control list on routers and changing firewall rules across the network for different products.\n\nTypical Security Solutions Not Sufficient Anymore\n\nUnfortunately, the traditional methods above are very time consuming, error prone, and not enough to handle today\u2019s dynamic network environment.\n\nIf a threat enters the network, it will be a challenge to prevent it from spreading. If a privileged account is hacked, then there\u2019s no telling how much data will get stolen.\n\nSo the big question is how can CISOs ensure security across users,\napplications, and hybrid, multi-cloud networks?\n\nJoin us to share your views and discover new age security solutions from ColorTokens that give nanoscopic visibility of security threats to hunt them down with precision.\n\nRajesh Khazanchi\n\nVP Products and Engineering, ColorTokens\n\nAnil Chopra\n\nVP-Research and Consulting, CyberMedia Research",

        "text":"RegistryOffice adds more COVID-19 scam domain report feeds to Abuse\u00a0Monitor.\n\nThis is an article that I originally posted on our site on April 1st.\n\nWe\u2019ve added more suspected COVID-19 pandemic related domain scam report source feeds and will shortly now include human verified blacklist feeds to production in our Abuse Monitor.\u00a0 This will help registry operators, registrars and hosters to save resources and effort managing the flood of COVID-19 domain abuse reports.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe will provide these feeds, as well as our existing reputation feeds, via Abuse Monitor at no charge or obligation for 60 days to any registry operator (gTLD or ccTLD), registrar or hosting providers that desire to access. Included in the service is our tool to manage identified domain abuse cases either through a web interface, or use our API. Contact us to get going.\n\ncovid19abuse w registrars example\n\nWe initially integrated a list provided by Malware Patrol and have since added and a continuously updated blacklist provided by the COVID-19 Cyber Threat Coalition (@ThreatCoalition) that we have joined and endorsed. This is a remarkable global volunteer coalition of cybersecurity experts publishing data sets with indicators believed to be used by criminals trying to prey on individuals, organizations, businesses and governments using the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\n\nThe additional feeds, as well as our existing reputation feeds, will help users determine if the multiple feeds that we have curated are reporting suspected abuse for the same domain name. Below is an example screenshot where three different sources are reporting for the same domain name:\n\ncovid19mask multi case example\n\nWe are working hard on combining all available intelligence and endeavour to compare what is received against vetted whitelists in order to assist in reducing false positives. As development cycles can vary widely among registry operators, registrars and hosters, getting access to this tool now (and at no charge) can assist in mitigating this particular abuse threat and free up internal dev people for other priorities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe are using the same abuse monitoring workflow logic that already applies to our tool for monitoring and managing domain abuse as defined by ICANN spec 11.3.b.\u00a0 Ultimately it is up to the registry operator or registrar to investigate each report of abuse and then manage each case according to their own policies and protocol, or they can be managed by RegistryOffice if using our managed services.\u00a0\n\nThe ICANN Registry Agreement Spec 11.3B is related to DNS abuse. The COVID-19 feeds are more focused on content on a website.\n\nSome of our COVID-19 feeds identify a domain name as suspicious based on keywords (\u201ccorona\u201d \u201ccovid19\u201d or other related keywords). This does not necessarily mean that the domain is being used for nefarious purposes. Some new registrations may be legitimate or point to parking pages. However, our testing has found that many are being used for malicious purposes such as leading to malware and phishing activity, which by our interpretation constitutes domain name abuse as defined by spec 11.3.b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe will shortly now include vetted COVID-19 feeds. A vetted feed is investigated by humans, hence should be more accurate and with lower false positives.\n\nCompared with \u201clegacy\u201d Reputation Block Lists\u00a0 (Spamhaus, SURBL etc), we ask you to understand that the COVID-19 feeds are developed rapidly and in a more \u201cad-hoc\u201d design. Our objective to add the COVID-19 feeds is to take part in the fight against false information, scams and phishing. We cannot let the pandemic be a playground for the bad guys.\n\nWe believe our subscribers will benefit from having this information and determine how best to act to protect their interests, and ultimately the public.\u00a0 We invite any registry operator (gTLD or ccTLD), registrar or hosting provider that has not yet subscribed to our domain Abuse Monitor to leverage our tools and the COVID-19 scam intelligence at no charge and no obligation for 60 days. Contact us to get going\n\nUpdated 2 April 2020 by Pinky Brand\nPosted 1 April 2020 by Pinky Brand\n\n\nPublished by pinkybrand\n\nI publish to three blogs. One ( is related to my lifelong interest in photography, video, wanderlust travel, and telling stories.

This is the basis for Build with Chrome, which happens to be a collaboration between Chrome and the LEGO Group that relied on WebGL, a 3D graphics technology, to be brought to life.\n\nOriginally developed by a team in Australia as part of an experiment, Build with Chrome is now opened to all and sundry, allowing you to publish your wacky creations on just about any unoccupied plot of land in the world. Additional features have been thrown into the mix to make life easier for one to build and explore this digital world of LEGO creations, where to begin you will first need to sign in with a Google+ account in order to locate the different kinds of stuff that folks in your circles have already created.\n\nYou can also take advantage of your hands to build your creations as long as the device you\u2019re using has touchscreen capability, as long as there is Chrome for Android support for WebGL on devices that feature high-end graphics capabilities.
