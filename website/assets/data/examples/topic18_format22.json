Here is what Father Heppel says:\n\nThe video is essentially correct. There a few things that have changed since JP2: he ruled that only a Cardinal can be elected, and that cardinals of a certain age can neither elect nor be elected.

        "text":"\n\nThe Bible is the best-selling book of all times. Most Christian families own one, some families or individuals own several. It is a prized possession that can be passed to future generations. Whether you own just one or several, the Bible needs good protection. This can be achieved with a Bible cover.\n\nIf you\u2019re savvy and creative, consider creating your own Bible cover. Before you go out and purchase material from your local fabric store, consider writing down what kind of material\/accessories you want included and the overall look of the cover. If you need assistance, take a look at current covers that are available for purchase or research cover designs online. The next step would be to purchase all the necessary material at your local store and follow a \u201cHow to Make A Bible \/Book Cover\u201d guide. There are several tutorials available online to follow.\n\nIf you are looking to take the easy route and simply purchase a Bible cover, there is no shame in that! You\u2019ll protect your Bible much more quickly than creating your own. You lose a bit of the personalization; however there are many great covers available for purchase to fulfill your needs. While Bible covers come in several types of fabrics including special material such as lambskin and nylon, the majority of these covers are composed of leather, suede, or microfiber.\n\nManufacturers today have amped up their design by providing styles and types that cater to personal tastes. In addition to creating new designs, they have maintained the old-fashioned black leather covers that equally protect your treasured Bible. Many of the covers available today include a strap for easy carrying and of course a main compartment for book storage. Out of the designs available, there are several camouflage-designed cases, female friendly prints and colors (zebra print, alligator print, pink and aqua hues), teen friendly prints and colors (flowered or sporty, hip designs) and child friendly prints and colors (animal and flower prints).\n\nBible cover designs are also including special features these days. Some covers\/organizers are larger in size, designed to include several exterior and internal organizational pockets for items such as study books, pens and notepads. Other designs also include reversible material that allows for owners to change up the look!\n\nWhatever your style, whatever features you require, there are many available covers that will protect your Bible from the elements. And there is no other book that should last the test of time and natural wear and tear.",

First, write their name on the top in easy-to-read letters, then let the children decorate the folder with stickers or drawings as they wish. This folder will be used to keep unfinished work in until the end of the series.\n\n\nFurther info? Click here\n\nMEMORY WORK (6 minutes)\n\nOld Testament Books of the Bible (handout sheet [PDF]) Click here\nNew Testament Books of the Bible (handout sheet [PDF]) Click here\nBible Books Starboard [PDF]\u00a0Click here\nDuring this series, the children will begin to memorize the books of the Bible. In order to memorize all of the books, this challenge will be continued for one or more additional lesson series. Give each child copies of the \"Old and New Testament Books of the Bible handout sheets\". These are worksheets to help them memorize the books of the Bible, and will be kept in their folders. Today, start by having the children look in their Bibles and write down the names of the first five books of the Old Testament on their handout sheets. Then have them memorize the first five books; Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. Also encourage the kids to continue memorizing the other books of the Bible at home. Suggest they seek help from parents or older brothers or sisters. The \"Bible Books Starboard\" will be used to display each child's progress as they memorize all the books.\n\nCLASS EXERCISE (10 minutes)\n\nOld Time Telephone (Game)\nHave the kids sit in a circle or line up and play the old telephone game to show how difficult it would be for the people who wrote the different books of the Bible to do so from memory with such accuracy. It would be impossible without the help of the Holy Spirit. You can use the following phrases or make up your own.\n1. Do you believe the Bible was written by more than thirty-five men inspired by the Holy Spirit?\n2. If there were thirty-three more books in the Bible there would be a total of ninety-nine.\n3. The Bible is more than words communicated to us from God; the Bible is the Word of God.\n\n\nThe Bible is also known as the Word of God. Do you believe the Bible? Why? Has anyone ever told you that they don't believe the Bible? Many people unfortunately think the Bible is just another long boring book. But of course the Bible is not just another book, it was given to man from God to reveal Jesus Christ as our savior.\nFrom Genesis, the very first book, to Revelation, the last book, the purpose of the Bible is Jesus. In John 5:39 Jesus himself says, \"These are the Scriptures that testify about me.\" But what can we say to people who just don't believe the Bible is the word of God? Let's look up some scriptures that may help us understand the significance and truth about the Bible. Help the children find the following verses and have someone read each one. Then discuss each verse.\n\nVerses and Discussion Questions:\n\n2 Timothy 3:16-17\n1. Where does all Scripture come from? (From God.)\n2. What is Scripture good for? (Teaching, rebuking, correcting, training and equipping.)\n\n2 Peter 1:20-21\n1. Does Scripture come from the will of man? (No, from the Will of God.)\n2. Who \"inspired\" or \"carried\" men to write the Bible? (The Holy Spirit.)\n\nPsalm 12:6\n1. Does the Bible contain any mistakes? (No, it is flawless.)\n2. What does \"pure\" gold or silver mean? (Without any impurities.)\n\nPsalm 119:160\n1. How can you respond to someone who says the Bible isn't true? (All of God's words are true, so the Bible is also true because it is the Word of God.)\n2. Does God ever need to come up with new rules or laws? (No, His laws are eternal.)\n\n1 Corinthians 2:14\n1. Why is it difficult for some people to understand the Bible? (Because they do not have the Holy Spirit to guide them.)\n2. How does God reveal the Bible to us? (By the Holy Spirit.)\n\nCLASS EXERCISE (10 minutes)\n\nBible Word Search (Puzzle)\u00a0Click here\n\n\nThere is a Book\u00a0(Song)\u00a0Click here\n\nAPPLICATION (2 minutes)\n\nWe know with certainty that the Bible is the inspired Word of God. The prophet Isaiah said that the earth was round (Isaiah 40:22) long before man believed it to be true. Man thought the world was flat! And not too long ago a young shepherd boy found scrolls that were over 2,000 years old. What was written on the scrolls was almost exactly like what we find today in the book of Isaiah. Moreover, numerous archaeological discoveries are proving that from an historical perspective the Bible is accurate. But, the Bible is more than just facts and history. The Bible brings us to a saving faith in God through His Son Jesus Christ. And we know this is true because the Holy Spirit makes us feel good about it.\n\n\nEveryone has made a puzzle right? How many of you have tried without using the picture on the box lid as a guide? Did looking at the picture make it easier or harder? Next week, we will see what happened to one not so bright fellow when he didn't bother using the guide he was given.\n\nCLOSING PRAYER (2 minutes)\n\nFurther info?

        "text":"Financial Success\n\nHow to Manifest Quickly Using EFT Tapping\n\nWritten by: Nick Ortner\n\nAll too often, our goals consist of little more than a \u201clist\u201d\u2026\n\n  \u2022 Make a million dollars\n  \u2022 Get my book published\n  \u2022 Travel the world\n  \u2022 Support my favorite charity\n\n\u2026and so on.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a great start to write them down, but if you don\u2019t dig deeper, they\u2019re unlikely to happen as quickly and completely as you\u2019d like them to.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read plenty of information on how to improve your goals: add emotional value, use visuals, expand on the feelings you\u2019ll have when you achieve the goal, look at them more often, etc.\n\nAnd all of those ideas are great, but if you\u2019re not in FULL alignment with your goal in the FIRST PLACE, you\u2019re basically wasting your time.\n\nRemember, alignment isn\u2019t just a surface, conscious alignment. You need to be aligned on\u00a0all levels. You need to address your \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and \u201cbuts\u201d about the issue fully.\n\nWhen you do that, you get out of your own way and can make things happen without those patterns of self-sabotage that are all too familiar.\n\nHere\u2019s a process with Tapping to help you.\u00a0This process involves having a general understanding of the Tapping protocols. If you\u2019re new to Tapping, take a moment to review\u00a0the basics of EFT Tapping.\n\nRemember, the more issues you address around all aspects of your goals, the better your results will be! Perhaps commit to working on one goal or issue a day for 30 days and see what happens.\n\nStep 1: Write down your goal, dream, or aspiration\n\nYou can make this a specific goal like:\u00a0I want to earn a million dollars a year\n\nA more general goal:\u00a0I want to bring peace to my relationship with my mom\n\nOr it can be stated more as a vision:\u00a0I\u2019d like to create dramatic social change\n\nWith this process, don\u2019t worry about getting it right. Whatever language pops up in your head first, that\u2019s the right language. But DO make sure to write it down.\n\n\nStep 2: Write down your immediate gut response when you read that goal\n\nHow do you FEEL?\n\nAre you 100% in alignment with it?\n\nHow does your body respond to reading it?\n\nFor example, you might feel and write down, \u201cI feel uncomfortable when I read this, I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m anxious\u2026\u201d\n\nBe specific in your notes and give every feeling a 0-10 rating.\n\nSo if you\u2019re feeling anxious as you read the goal, write down, \u201cI\u2019m feeling anxious\u201d and then put a number of its intensity next to it. \u201c8\u201d for example.\n\nYou can write down more than one emotion or feeling. Be as specific as possible.\n\nDo you feel tension in your stomach? Write that down.\n\nAre you slightly nauseous? Write that down.\n\n\nStep 3: Write down what other people would say about your goal if you shared it with them\n\nFriends, family members, society, co-workers, etc.\n\nWhatever pops in your head first, write that down.\n\nSo if you think about sharing your goal with your mom, and you picture her saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a silly idea\u2026\u201d then write that down, PLUS how you FEEL about her thoughts.\n\nBe specific and give it a number of intensity, as described above.\n\n\nStep 4: Write down YOUR beliefs about the goal\n\nFor example, \u201cPart of me thinks this is impossible\u2026 I\u2019ve never been able to do this before\u2026 Who am I to think I can achieve this\u2026?\u201d\n\nNote the feelings this brings up and write those down as well.\n\nBe specific and assign them a number of emotional intensity.\n\n\nStep 5: Systematically tap OUT all of this RESISTANCE and tap IN, positive feelings & expectations!\n\nGo through each item that brought up an emotional response, and tap on it until you bring the feelings around it down to \u201c0\u201d or a low number.\n\nBe sure to keep note of anything else that comes up through the process.\n\nYou may not be able to do this in one session, so take your time with it.\n\nWhen you have tapped through all the issues (and make sure to keep digging for more hidden ones), you\u2019ve then cleared the way for your goal to become a reality!\n\nTapping Script Example\n\nLet\u2019s go through one example of what this might look like together, so you can tap along.\n\nI\u2019m just making up potential responses so you can see how it works\u2026\n\nStep 1: Write down the goal\n\nEXAMPLE: I want to earn $250,000 a year\n\nStep 2: How do you FEEL?\n\nEXAMPLE: Looking at this, I get a little nervous. There\u2019s a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, and pressure around making this work. When I close my eyes, I feel this sinking feeling at a 7.\n\nWhen I ask myself what this feeling is, it\u2019s anxiety. I\u2019m going to do some tapping on this now.\n\nKarate Chop: Even though I have this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, I deeply and completely accept myself.\nKarate Chop: Even though I have this sinking feeling about making $250,000, I choose to relax now.\nKarate Chop: Even though I feel uncomfortable in my body when I look at this goal, I deeply and completely accept myself.\n\nEyebrow: This sinking feeling\nSide of Eye: I\u2019m feeling a little nervous\nUnder Eye: This sinking feeling\nUnder Nose: In the pit of my stomach\nUnder Mouth: I feel pressure around making this work\nCollarbone: I feel this anxiety in my stomach\nUnder Arm: All this anxiety\nTop of Head: All this sinking feeling\n\nKeep on tapping around the meridian points on whatever comes up until you bring it down enough to find some relief and feel ready to move on to the positive.\n\n\nEyebrow: I chose to relax now\nSide of Eye: And release this sinking feeling\nUnder Eye: I let it all go\nUnder Nose: From the pit of my stomach\nUnder Mouth: All this anxiety\nCollarbone: Releases now\nUnder Arm: All this fear about making $250,000 a year\nTop of Head: Releases now\n\nStep 3: Write down what other people would say about your Goal if you shared it with them\n\nEXAMPLE: If I told my friends I wanted to make $250,000 a year, half of them would laugh at me and the other half would tell me I was being greedy.\n\nWhen I think about telling my friends, I just feel small and not confident at all. This feeling is at an 8.\n\nKarate Chop: Even though I don\u2019t feel confident telling my friends about my goal, I deeply and completely accept myself.\nKarate Chop: Even though I don\u2019t want my friends to know my goal, I deeply and completely accept myself.\nKarate Chop: Even though I know they\u2019ll judge me if I tell them my goal, I deeply and completely accept myself.\n\nEyebrow: I don\u2019t want to tell my friends\nSide of Eye: When I think about telling them, it makes me feel small\nUnder Eye: This feeling of being small\nUnder Nose: I\u2019m worried that they\u2019ll judge me\nUnder Mouth: I\u2019m worried they won\u2019t like me\nCollarbone: I\u2019m worried about what my friends will think\nUnder Arm: If I tell them my goal\nTop of Head: Or if I achieve my goal!\n\nKeep on tapping around the meridian points on whatever comes up until you bring it down enough to find some relief and feel ready to move to the positive.\n\n\nEyebrow: I release this feeling of being small\nSide of Eye: I chose to feel big!\nUnder Eye: I\u2019m confident in my goal\nUnder Nose: And I release any anxiety about it\nUnder Mouth: I\u2019m confident in what I want for myself\nCollarbone: And I\u2019m confident that the right people will support me\nUnder Arm: Feeling strong and confident\nTop of Head: Feeling strong and confident!\n\nContinue on to Step 4 and 5, rinse and repeat. \ud83d\ude42\n\nSeriously, the KEY on this process is to get specific on your issues, on your feelings, and to be SYSTEMATIC about it, going through all the different ASPECTS of the issue.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your results! Please share them below!\n\nBlog Comments\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nYour Comment\n\n140 Comments on this post\n\n  1. Carolyn says:\n\n    Hi Nick, thank-you so much. Going through the reading I realized I forgot step 3,about what others may think about my goal. I\u2019ve been doing tapping on my goal for 1week now. I missed a day in between though.\n    I used to tap to release cravings, I never used to feel the impact mainly because I never used to use words. I realise there\u2019s a big difference if tapping using words.\n\n\n  2. Jayne says:\n\n    I have been using the law of attraction for over 2yrs and just stumbled on EFT recently, after I needed a means of clearing multiple limiting beliefs I have lived with almost all my life. I have used EFT on little immediate emotional issues and I\u2019m amazed at how effective it has been. I\u2019m so excited to begin this technique. Thanks alot Nick.\n\n  3. Ver\u00f3nica says:\n\n    My dream right now is helping my dog come over his trauma of having been mistreated and abandoned when he was a puppy. Today it\u2019s been six months since we rescue him and he still has separation anxiety.\n    I\u2019d love to help him.\n    Thanks so much for everything you share, I discovered tapping a few weeks ago and I love it!! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n  4. Ruth Pidick says:\n\n    I believe it is a great tapping exercise. I would love a comment from Nick about the difficulty I have with the doubt aspect, perhaps that is fear I don\u2019t know. Is the repetition the best thing I can do??\n\n    Ruth P.\n\n    \u2022 Nick Ortner says:\n\n      Hi Ruth. I would recommend you tap directly on the doubt and fear, even if you don\u2019t know what it is in relation to and see what comes up for you. Start where you are, tap and speak about what you are feeling and trust the process. \ud83d\ude42\n\n  5. sajida says:\n\n\n    \u2022 Nick Ortner says:\n\n      You\u2019re welcome! Yes, tapping while using prayers and affirmations can really help you cement those positive feelings so give it a try and see how it feels t you. \ud83d\ude42\n\n  6. Phillip says:\n\n    Awesome,this is great ,I\u2019m left speechless n my confidance shot up,i feel great already,like a\n    millionaire Regards Phillip\n\n  7. Camille says:\n\n    I am scared, so frightened. My financial goal will never happen. I don\u2019t deserve it. Am I really worthless? Tap tap tap\u2026\n\n    I am beginning to feeling stronger about reaching my goal. I am confident. I am doing it. I am happy and joyful that I now have the faith in myself to succeed. : )\n\n    This one is a hard one.\n\n  8.

As we learned in Session 1, God is the author of life and we are the stewards. We do not have absolute power over our lives. However we also know that for some, death will come quickly and others may find suffering. There is never an obligation for a Christian to suffer without pain killing drugs (analgesics). Steps are being taken to remedy the lack of training of doctors in the field of pain control. Consultations with pain specialists may be indicated in cases of difficult pain management.\n\nPass out Student Handout #4: \"What Does His Word Say About Suffering?\".\n\n  1. Have a member of the class READ 2 Corinthians 12:9-10.\n    Discuss: What does His Word says about suffering at the end of life?\n\n\n  2. Have a member of the class READ Romans 8:28-39.\n    Discuss: What assurance does the Lord give us during times of suffering?\n\n\n  3. Have a member of the class READ Romans 5:1-14.\n    Discuss: As Christians how may our approach to these life decisions bear witness to the Lord in us?\n\nPass out Student Handout #5: \"Principles Governing Medical Treatment Decisions.\"\n\nThese principles reflect a Biblical response to the sanctity of human life regardless of the individuals age or capabilities. They are designed to be a guideline when making difficult end of life decisions regarding medical treatment. Stress the importance of respecting all human life, including those who can no longer function in an active role in society. Each person should be treated with respect and loving care, which includes providing as much comfort humanly possible through the provision for basic needs, food and water, and effective pain management.\n\nRead aloud to the class all the principles on the handout and discuss how these principles relate to the scriptures studied today on suffering and those studied last week on the sanctity of life.\n\nPass Out \"Blessings Through Suffering\"\n\nStress the importance of the next session. Explain to the students they will be given the opportunity to work through actual case studies where they can apply these Biblical life principles.\n\nClosing Moment\n\nInvite all to join hands in a circle. Ask everyone to include those among you who are suffering physical, mental, or emotional pain. Pray for families, friends, and care givers of those who suffer.\n\nback to top",

        "text":"Things to Know For Efficiently Working with a Psychic\n\nThe realm of energy is gaining a lot of recognition nowadays. Even science has begun to agree that everything around us is nothing but energy. Based on this theory, many transcendent or non-physical healing practices are taking place today. Psychic sessions are one of these practices. Psychic professionals do not only help with healing but many other aspects nowadays.\n\nIf you are planning to hire a psychic, you can explore the service details of Saint Louis Psychics online. The team of experts is recognized for providing entrusted and highly cooperative psychic sessions to its valued clientele. But before that, here are tiny pointers that you should know before hiring a psychic!\n\nSet Expectations Right\n\nOften it is said that a psychic will tell you what you require and not what you demand. The valued information that comes to you is authentic and divine. They work by communicating with energies and realms beyond the physical or human reach. So the words you hear often come via them and not from them. So having a very rigid expectation in mind about what you will receive is going to confuse you.\n\nEmbrace the New Ways\n\nSo, this is one of the biggest challenges people face. Not everybody believes in the energy world or divinity, which is absolutely fine. But if you are looking forward to seeking help from a psychic, it is important you let them lead. Unless you are collaborative and open to their practice, they will not be able to provide you with the right information.\n\nDevil Is In the Divine Details\n\nPay attention to the details in your session. If you are attending for the first time, carry a notebook. The details will help you get a sheer clarification about what you need to understand or act upon. A proper psychic will be able to tell you unexpected and credible details.\n\nDon\u2019t Hesitate To Leave a Session That Feels Wrong\n\nNo matter how recognized a psychic is, an authentic individual in this field will never straight away predict someone\u2019s death or an upcoming jackpot. These readings do not work that way. The symbols, signs, and symbols are authentic, honest, and subtle.\n\nThese experts utilize their extra sensory perceptions for healing, gathering information, reading minds; connect to the deceased, and more.

Place thirteen black and orange candles around the circle, and as you light each one say:\n\"Samhain candle of fire so bright\nConsecrate this circle of light.\"\n\nIn the center of the circle, erect an altar facing north. On the center of the altar, place three candles (white, red and black) to represent each phase of the Triple Goddess. To the left (west) of the candles, place a chalice filled with apple cider and a dish containing sea salt. To the right (east) of the candles, place a censer of herb incense and a small bowl of water. Before the candles (south), place a brass altar bell, a consecrated athame, and a red apple.\n\nRing the altar bell thrice and say:\n\"In the sacred name of the Goddess\nand under her protection\nis this Sabbat Rite now begun.\"\n\nSprinkle a bit of salt and water at each compass point around the circle to cleanse the space of any negativity or evil influences.\n\nTake the athame in your right hand, and say:\n\"Harken well ye elements\nAir, fire, water, earth\nBy bell and blade I summon thee\nOn this sacred night of mirth.\"\n\nDip the blade of the athame into the chalice of apple cider and say:\n\"I offer to Thee, O Goddess\nThis nectar of the season.\"\n\nReturn the athame to the altar. Light the incense and the three altar candles, and say:\n\"Three candles I do light\nin honor of Thee, O Goddess:\nWhite for the Maiden,\nRed for the Mother,\nBlack for the Crone.\nO Goddess of all things wild and free,\nStrong and loving, fair and just,\nThis sacred temple I raise to Thee\nIn Perfect Love,\nIn Perfect Trust.\"\n\nPick up the chalice with both hands and pour a few drops of the cider onto the apple and say:\n\"To the Womb of the Mother Goddess\nThe Horned God now returns\nUntil the day when he is reborn again.\nThe great solar wheel\nOnce again turns.\nThe cycle of the seasons never ends.\nBlessed be the souls of those\nwho have journeyed beyond\nTo the dark world of the dead.\nI pour this nectar\nin honor of their memory.\nMay the Goddess bless them\nWith Light, Beauty and Joy.\nBlessed Be!\nBlessed Be!\"\n\nDrink the remaining cider, and then return the chalice to its place on the altar. Ring the bell thrice, and then release the circle by extinguishing the orange and black candles, starting at the east and moving in a counterclockwise direction.\n\nTake the apple from the altar and bury it outside in the earth to nourish the souls of those who have died in the past year.\n\nThe Samhain ritual is now complete and should be followed by meditation, divination by crystal ball, the reciting of mystical Goddess-inspired poetry, and a Witches' prayer for the souls of all family members and friends who have passed on to the Spiritual Plane.",

        "text":"Lesson 27: \u201cHe Is Not Here, for He Is Risen\u201d\n\nNew Testament: Gospel Doctrine Teacher\u2019s Manual, (2002), 112\u201315\n\n\nTo help class members feel gratitude for the Savior\u2019s Resurrection and the blessings it brings us.\n\n\n  1. 1.\n\n    Read, ponder, and pray about the following scriptures:\n\n    1. a.\n\n      Matthew 28:1\u201315; Luke 24:1\u201312; John 20:1\u201310. Mary Magdalene and other women come to Jesus\u2019 tomb and find it empty. Angels announce that Jesus has been resurrected. Peter and John come to see the empty tomb. The risen Lord appears to the women.\n\n    2. b.\n\n      Luke 24:13\u201335. Jesus walks and talks with two disciples on the road to Emmaus. They do not recognize him until he breaks bread for them.\n\n    3. c.\n\n      Matthew 28:16\u201320; Luke 24:33\u201353; John 20:19\u201331. Jesus appears to his Apostles, shows them that he has been resurrected, and commands them to teach the gospel to all nations. Thomas feels the wounds in Jesus\u2019 hands, feet, and side.\n\n    4. d.\n\n      John 21. Jesus appears again to some of the Apostles at the Sea of Tiberias (the Sea of Galilee). He commands Peter, \u201cFeed my sheep.\u201d\n\n  2. 2.\n\n    Additional reading: Mark 16; Bible Dictionary, \u201cResurrection,\u201d 761.\n\n  3. 3.\n\n    Ask a class member to prepare to summarize the account of Jesus and the two disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13\u201332).\n\n  4. 4.\n\n    If the following pictures are available, use them during the lesson: Burial of Jesus (62180; Gospel Art Picture Kit 231); Jesus\u2019 Tomb (62111; Gospel Art Picture Kit 232) or The Empty Tomb (Gospel Art Picture Kit 245); Mary and the Resurrected Lord (62186; Gospel Art Picture Kit 233); Jesus Shows His Wounds (62503; Gospel Art Picture Kit 234); and The Resurrected Jesus Christ (62187; Gospel Art Picture Kit 239).\n\n  5. 5.\n\n    Suggestion for teaching: The Lord\u2019s commandment to Peter, \u201cFeed my sheep\u201d (John 21:16\u201317), applies to all teachers. Prayerfully seek ways to make the spiritual food of the scriptures appealing to class members so they will want to feast on it. (See Teaching, No Greater Call [36123], pages\u00a05\u20137.)\n\nSuggested Lesson Development\n\nAttention Activity\n\nAs appropriate, use the following activity or one of your own to begin the lesson.\n\nRelate the following story told by Elder James\u00a0M. Paramore:\n\n\u201cMany years ago \u2026 a writer for a newspaper was asked an important question, \u2018What would be the most important news the world could receive?\u2019\u201d\n\n  \u2022 How would you answer this question?\n\nElder Paramore continued: \u201c[The writer] thought and thought about the question, he talked to many people, and read all he could in an effort to find an answer for himself. And finally, he printed his answer, \u2018To know that Jesus Christ lives today would be the most important news the world could receive. In fact, if He lives today, then we too will live eternally as He said\u2019\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1990, 80; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 64).\n\nDisplay the pictures listed in the \u201cPreparation\u201d section. Explain that the disciples\u2019 sorrow at Christ\u2019s death was replaced with unspeakable joy at his Resurrection. We too can rejoice in the knowledge that Christ was resurrected.\n\nLeave the pictures on display. Refer to them at appropriate points in the lesson.\n\nScripture Discussion and Application\n\nAs you teach the following scripture passages, discuss with class members how their knowledge of the Resurrection affects their daily lives. Rather than trying to determine the exact order of events surrounding the Resurrection (each Gospel writer gives a slightly different order), focus on the testimonies of the Resurrection given in each Gospel account.\n\n1. Mary Magdalene and other women are witnesses of the resurrected Lord.\n\nDiscuss Matthew 28:1\u201315; Luke 24:1\u201312; and John 20:1\u201310. Invite class members to read selected verses aloud. Explain that after Jesus was crucified, his body was wrapped in clean linen cloths and placed in a tomb belonging to Joseph of Arimathea, one of Jesus\u2019 disciples (Matthew 27:57\u201360; Luke 23:50\u201353; John 19:38\u201342). This was done quickly because the Sabbath was about to begin. The morning after the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene and other women returned to the tomb with spices and ointments to more thoroughly anoint and embalm Jesus\u2019 body.\n\n  \u2022 What did Mary Magdalene and the other women find when they came to Jesus\u2019 tomb? (See Matthew 28:1\u20134; Luke 24:1\u20134. Note that the Joseph Smith Translation of Matthew 28 states, as Luke does, that there were two angels. See Matthew 28:2, footnote 2a.) What did the angels tell the women? (See Matthew 28:5\u20137; Luke 24:5\u20138.)\n\n  \u2022 What did the angels mean when they said, \u201cHe is risen\u201d? (Jesus had been resurrected.) What does it mean to be resurrected? (See Alma 11:42\u201345; see also Bible Dictionary, \u201cResurrection,\u201d 761.) What blessings will we receive because of Jesus\u2019 Resurrection? (See 1\u00a0Corinthians 15:22, 50\u201358; Alma 11:42\u201345. We will all be resurrected and be given immortal bodies.)\n\n  \u2022 President Howard\u00a0W. Hunter said that the words \u201cHe is not here, but is risen\u201d (Luke 24:6) \u201ccontain all the hope, assurance, and belief necessary to sustain us in our challenging and sometimes grief-filled lives\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1986, 18; or Ensign, May 1986, 15\u201316). How has your testimony of the Atonement and the Resurrection helped you through difficult times?\n\n  \u2022 What did the women do after the angels finished speaking? (See Matthew 28:8; Luke 24:8\u20139.) What can we learn from their example?\n\n  \u2022 Mary and the other women were the first of many people who saw Jesus Christ after he was resurrected (see also the second and third additional teaching ideas). Why do you think it was important that the resurrected Lord appear to earthly witnesses? (See 2\u00a0Corinthians 13:1.)\n\n2. Two disciples on the road to Emmaus are witnesses of the resurrected Lord.\n\nDiscuss Luke 24:13\u201335. Have the assigned class member summarize the scripture passage.\n\n  \u2022 Why were Cleopas and his companion sad as they walked along the road to Emmaus? (See Luke 24:13\u201324.) What did the resurrected Lord teach them as they walked? (See Luke 24:25\u201327.)\n\n  \u2022 How did the two disciples feel as Jesus taught them? (See Luke 24:32.) What gave them this feeling? (The influence of the Holy Ghost.) Invite class members to tell of experiences when they have received a witness from the Spirit while studying the gospel or hearing someone teach it.\n\n3. The Apostles are witnesses of the resurrected Lord.\n\nRead and discuss selected verses from Matthew 28:16\u201320; Luke 24:33\u201353; and John 20:19\u201331.\n\n  \u2022 What did the Apostles think they were seeing when the Savior appeared to them on the evening of the day he was resurrected? (See Luke 24:36\u201337.) How did Jesus reassure them that he was a resurrected being, not a spirit? (See Luke 24:38\u201343.)\n\n  \u2022 How did Thomas respond to the other Apostles\u2019 testimonies that the Lord had been resurrected? (See John 20:24\u201325.) How did he come to believe that the Lord had been resurrected? (See John 20:26\u201329.) How do we sometimes show the same weakness as Thomas?\n\n    Elder Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley said:\n\n    \u201cHave you not heard others speak as Thomas spoke? \u2018Give us,\u2019 they say, \u2018the empirical evidence. Prove before our very eyes, and our ears, and our hands, else we will not believe.\u2019 This is the language of the time in which we live. Thomas the Doubter has become the example of men in all ages who refuse to accept other than that which they can physically prove and explain\u2014as if they could prove love, or faith, or even such physical phenomena as electricity.\u00a0\u2026\n\n    \u201cTo all within the sound of my voice who may have doubts, I repeat the words given Thomas as he felt the wounded hands of the Lord: \u2018Be not faithless, but believing\u2019\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1978, 90; or Ensign, May 1978, 59).\n\n  \u2022 How can we more fully follow the Lord\u2019s admonition to \u201cbe not faithless, but believing\u201d? (John 20:27).\n\n4. Some of the Apostles see Jesus again at the Sea of Tiberias (Sea of Galilee).\n\nRead and discuss selected verses from John 21.\n\n  \u2022 The resurrected Lord showed himself again to seven of his Apostles as they were fishing. How did they come to realize it was Jesus on the shore? (See John 21:4\u20137.) After they had eaten, what did Jesus ask Peter and the other Apostles to do? (See John 21:15\u201317.) How can we feed the Lord\u2019s sheep?\n\n  \u2022 What was John\u2019s reason for writing down some of the things that the resurrected Jesus said and did? (See John 20:30\u201331.) How have you benefited from studying the scriptural accounts of Jesus\u2019 Resurrection?\n\n\nTestify that Jesus Christ was resurrected and that because of him we will also be resurrected. Bear testimony of the strength and comfort that your knowledge of the Resurrection has brought you.\n\nAdditional Teaching Ideas\n\nThe following material supplements the suggested lesson outline. You may want to use one or more of these ideas as part of the lesson.\n\n1. \u201cHe is risen\u201d (Matthew 28:6)\n\nArrange for a small group to sing \u201cHe Is Risen\u201d (Hymns, no.\u00a0199) or \u201cChrist the Lord Is Risen Today\u201d (Hymns, no.\u00a0200) at the end of the lesson. Or have a group of children sing \u201cDid Jesus Really Live Again?\u201d (Children\u2019s Songbook, 64).\n\n2. \u201cWoman, why weepest thou?\u201d (John 20:15)\n\nPoint out that the Gospel of John is the only Gospel that contains an account of the Lord\u2019s appearance to Mary Magdalene just after his Resurrection. Have a class member read aloud this account in John 20:11\u201318. Invite class members to share their thoughts and feelings about this event.\n\n3. Other witnesses of the resurrected Lord\n\n4. Scriptures about the Resurrection\n\nSeveral scripture passages from the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants increase our understanding of the Resurrection. Discuss as many of the following points as time allows:\n\n  1. a.\n\n    Jesus was the first to be resurrected (2\u00a0Nephi 2:8), and because of his Resurrection, all people will be resurrected (2\u00a0Nephi 9:22; Alma 11:42, 44).\n\n  2. b.\n\n    After Jesus Christ, those who receive a celestial glory will be resurrected first, followed by those who receive a ...

However, the purpose of a Fundraising Proposal is to raise funds for your project.\nSee Workbook for an outline of a Business Plan, and examples of Business Plans.\nSee Workbook for a Model of a Constitution.\n\nHow to register as an NPO and PBO\nThe Non-Profit Organisation Act of 1997 establishes a legal framework that allows non-profit organisations to grow and develop. Under this act, is the Directorate of Non-Profit Organisations, which is now housed in the Department of Social Development. This department is responsible for building a system of social development services that facilitates human development and works in partnership with non-profit and non-governmental organisations.\n\nImportance of registering\nIt is important to register your organisation as a legal entity. Most \u2013 if not all \u2013 funders, require that each organisation they fund is officially registered with the government as a non-profit organisation. A non-profit organisation is defined as a trust, a company or other association of persons, established for a public purpose, where the income and property of the organisation are not distributable to its members or office bearers, except as reasonable compensation for services rendered.\n\nAny organisation can apply for registration, provided that it is not for profit and is not part of the government, such as:\nNon-government Organisations (NGO),\nCommunity-based Organisations (CBO),\nFaith-based Organisations (FBO),\nOrganisations that have registered as Section 21 Companies under the Company Act 61 of 1973,\nTrusts that have been registered with the Master of the Supreme Court under the Trust Property Control Act 57 of 1988, and\nAny other Voluntary Association that is non-profit.\n\nThe registration process\nThere are several things you need to consider before you decide to register your organisation.\n\nThe directorate will only register a properly set up legal entity with a founding document, such as a constitution. This document must\nexplain what your organisation will do, how it will be structured, and how it will be run. An example of a constitution can be downloaded from or obtained directly from the department at (012) 312 7500.\n\nType of organisation.\nYour organisation will need to make a decision about the type of non-profit organisation it would like to form. There are several different types: Section 21 or Section 18(a) companies; trusts and voluntary organisations.\n\nChoice of legal entity.\nBe aware that while many donors will fund any type of non-profit organisation, others will only fund a Section 21 or Section 18(a) company. This is an \u2018Association Not For Gain\u2019 and does not intend to make, or to be judged by, the profits that it makes. It is therefore important to consider which type of registration is best suited to your organisation. This information, and other details regarding legal entities is available on .\n\nOpening a bank account.\nA funding organisation cannot give you funding without a bank account. Therefore, if you are a new organisation you will need to open one.\n\nRegistration requirements\nSubmit a completed application form (obtainable from the Department) and two copies of the organisation\u2019s founding document i.e. a constitution\/ deed of Trust or, a Memorandum and Articles of Association. Please note that registration for a non-profit organisation is free of charge.\n\nNPO Directorate\nDepartment of Social Development\nPrivate Bag X901, Pretoria, 0001\nTel: 012 312 7500\n\nBenefits of registering\nRegistering helps in finding ways of getting benefits like tax incentives and funding opportunities.\nRegistering brings your organisation into a formal system.\nRegistering makes your organisation accountable to a public office, which, in turn improves its credibility.\n\nIncome tax exemption\nIncome tax exemption is preferent...

It was taken into consideration to be a part of the physiognomy.\n\nThe Ultimate Palm-Reading Overview for Beginners\n\nKay Packard, the creator of the American Academy of Hand Evaluation and writer of Your Life Is In Your Hands: Practical Hand Reading for Purposeful Living, discusses the fortune-teller party technique.\n\nIntrigued in cleaning up on the divination method of palm analysis, or palmistry? Knowing exactly how to review palms takes technique, but our hand analysis overview from palmistry professional Kay Packard makes the art of chiromancy appearance simple.\n\nReviewing Your Hand Shape\n\nIn the technique of palmistry, palm form supplies understanding into personality features and generally associates with the 4 aspects: fire, air, earth, and water, Saucedo says. Each of these aspects stands for a different character profile. To assess hand shape, you\u2019ll intend to consider the proportion of the hand in connection with the fingers.\n\nFire hands: Noteworthy for a long hand with brief fingers, these individualities are restless, nervous, and warm.\n\nWater hands: Identified by a long hand with long fingers, water hands are are delicate, compassionate, and emotional.\n\nAir hands: Tend to feature a square or rectangle-shaped palm with lengthy fingers, and have individualities that are adaptable, intellectual, and curious.\n\nPlanet hands: Feature a square palm with short fingers, and have a tendency to be grounded, sensible, and a realist.\n\nMaintain in mind that hand kind does not always refer your astrological profile you may be a water indication according to astrologist near Beirne Arkansas 71721, yet your hand form may indicate you\u2019re an earth sign.

If you have an extremely rounded heart line that looks like a half circle, Saucedo states that would certainly suggest a really nurturing, open, and psychological nature. If your heart line is directly, then you could be a little bit much more guarded or self-preserved about your feelings.\n\nThere are additionally essential differences to note in between straight and curved head lines. A very bent head line shows imagination, while a straight head line indicate a person that is really rational and likes logistics \u201cblack and white, yes or no,\u201d states Saucedo.\n\nOne common mistaken belief Saucedo is fast to direct out is that regardless of prominent idea, the life line has nothing to do with your lifespan. \u201cIf it fades out, it\u2019s simply an item of your life where you may feel like the rug was pulled out from under you,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Love Line the Longer the Better\n\nThe love line is the line extending throughout the hand straight under the fingers.

        "text":"Why Fast?\n\nMany followers of Jesus Christ want to be able to hear more clearly from Him and have wondered if there is a way to improve this essential ability. Spending time with Jesus helps us hear from Him, but often the \u201cnoise\u201d of busyness, distractions and other desires drown out His voice.\u00a0For centuries, combining fasting with prayer has been a time-honored way of reducing the clutter and noise around us so we can hear from God. God has used fasting in my own life and countless others to deepen our walk with Him.\n\nWhat is Fasting?\n\nFasting is going without food or certain activities for a period of time in order to focus on God; to deepen our hunger for God and increase our sensitivity to His voice. Fasting feeds our hunger for God. \u00a0Fasting can be a powerful time in the life of those who love God and want to grow deeper in their relationship with Him. But many aren\u2019t sure how to fast or what to do while they are fasting. That\u2019s what this guide is for.\n\nFasting as a church\n\nIn 2015 we asked God to ignite prayer in us. He is! Now in 2017 He is\ntaking us deeper. He wants us to experience the power of fasting and prayer and has called me to lead us through a graduated, step-by-step process over a one-month period. I believe this will be a powerful time of breakthrough and intimacy with God for each of us and therefore for Church of the Open Door as a whole! Each of us can follow this process and grow in our relationship with God. This is meant to be a corporate exercise not just an individual one, so encourage each other. Join a LifeGroup and share with each other how it\u2019s going.\n\nTypes of Fasting:\n\nLiquid Fast: This Fast is the restriction of solid food\u00a0intake, and replacement of solid food with liquids. All throughout the day, make sure you drink plenty of water, as well as, fruit juices, vegetable juices, herbal teas, smoothies and broth.\n\nDaniel Fast: The Daniel Fast is modeled after the spiritual practices of Daniel. Basically, the Daniel Fast is to abstain from eating meat and to eat only what comes from the ground that have not been refined or processed.\n\nMedia Fast: For this type of Fast, abstain from anything that would personally distract us from our purposes in the Fast (e.g. television, social media, video games, hanging out, idle conversations, texting, gossip etc.)\n\nHungering for God\n\nWhenever you feel a craving to eat or use media, stop right there and ask God to deepen your hunger for Him.\u00a0 Tell Him you want to learn what Jesus meant in John 4:32 and Matthew 4:4. (Guess you\u2019re gonna have to look those up!) \u00a0Fasting helps you feed on God.\n\nYou will have more time on your hands than normal; don\u2019t fill it with activities.\u00a0 Spend it praying and reading God\u2019s Word (i.e. the Gospels or Psalms) and a book such as:\n\nThe Pursuit of God -A.W. Tozer\n\nLearn to Breathe -Jim Mindling\n\nRenovation of the Heart -Dallas Willard\n\nA Hunger for God \u2013John Piper\n\nKnowing God \u2013J.I. Packer\n\nListening to God \u2013Jan Johnson",

        "text":"+971 56 392 1178 [email\u00a0protected]\n\nApart from looking pretty, I love having crystals around for the beautiful healing energy they emanate. But how to choose your precious stones? How to use them? And how can you upkeep crystals? In this blog I tell you which crystals work for me & what I do to take care of them.\n\n\nMy favourite crystals\n\nMy personal favourite, I own two bracelets of this stone, is the Angel Aura Quartz. It is created by bonding a natural clear Quartz crystal with a precious metal infusion of pure platinum and silver. Usually colour-enhancing of crystals lessens it\u2019s qualities, but in this case (and as with Aqua Aura, Lavender Aura, Sunshine Aura etc.) it is a strong enhancer. Angel Aura is a strong protector and cleanser of energy. It also helps receive messages from the angelic realm and find spiritual purpose. I love working with this crystal during healings for it calms both me and the healing recipient.\nThis crystal is quite delicate so keep it out of direct sunlight when recharging. More about this later (:\n\nQuite a few clients that come see me need reinforcement of their self-love. The go-to stone in these cases is usually Rose Quartz. Though I love the softness and energy of this crystal, I personally prefer the intenser love energy of Strawberry Quartz. It brings a lot of healing to the heart as well as universal love to the person working with it. It amplifies intentions of love, gratitude and generosity. And did you know that green crystals such as Malachite, Green Aventurine, Emerald, Green Kunzite, Peridote and Jade also have a positive effect on healing the heart chakra?\n\nAs a protector of my energy I have a Black Tourmaline next to my bed. When I sleep it takes care and cleanses my energetic field of any negativity that I pick up in my work during the day. It is also amazing for grounding. And it a good protector to carry with you during the day or to place on your desk at work. Another great stone for energy protection (I keep it with me during my sessions) is Labradorite. The plus side of the latter is that it is also a very spiritual stone; helping you build your intuition and psychic abilities. For protection and grounding you can also acquire a Smoky Quartz, Hematite or an Obsidian.\n\nThe all-time favourite crystal will always be the Amethyst. It is a great first-time stone, for someone who would like an introduction to crystal energy. It offers protective, cleansing energy, while improving intuition and spiritual growth. It provides energy to receive self-insights and to clear emotions related to past experiences. Plus it\u2019s very affordable \ud83d\ude09\n\nFinally I would like to give a few others an honorary mention:\nCitrine for self-confidence, joy and abundance\nClear Quartz for healing, purifying, vitalising and increases the power of other crystals\nLapis Lazuli for communication, speaking up for yourself, strengthening relationships\nOpalite for enlightenment, positivity, clearing the mind and relaxation\nfor protection and support while working spiritually, it also recharges other stones\nTiger Eye\nfor strength, confidence, courage and to reduce tension and stress\n\n\nHow to work with crystals\n\nI have a lot of bracelets with round crystal beads. I wear them on my left wrist (receiving), while the right wrist will allow you to pass on the energy (giving). Apart from that I keep a black tourmaline, pyrite (for abundance), rose quartz and a celestite (to remember my dreams better) on my bed stand. Occasionally I wear a necklace with a crystal to strengthen either my throat, heart or solar plexus chakra. Other ways to work with your crystals are to wear rings with stones or to carry them in a pouch in your pocket or in your bra (close to your heart chakra!).\n\nWhen you want the crystals to work optimally you have to make sure you cleanse them before using them. It\u2019s also good to set an intention of use.\n\n\nCleansing your crystals and setting the intention\n\nCrystals will take up energy from everyone who comes in contact with them. Therefore be selective in who you allow to touch your crystals. You are best off doing a thorough cleansing of your stones after you buy them, and allow them to fully recharge before you start using them. When you plan to use crystals for healing, make sure you cleanse them after every client. The recharging can be done once a month. The best time for this is between the two days before and two days after the full moon.\n\nCleansing your gems can be done in several different ways. I have tried leaving them in salt water for seven days. It is supposedly the most thorough cleansing process. If you resonate with this practice keep in mind some stones cannot handle salt or water well! Avoid cleansing your amber, alabaster, azurite, calcite, carnelian, dioptase halite, hematite, kunzite, kyanite, labradorite\/spectrolite, lepidolite, lodestone (magnetite), mica, moldavite, moonstone, opal, red coral, topaz, turquoise and ulexite with (salt) water.\n\nRunning water (sea, streams or even tap water) is also often mentioned for cleaning. A rule of thumb using water would be that the harder stones (quartz, fluorite, amethyst) are tolerant of water while softer stones (opals, carnelian, clusters of stones) are not. Also know that generally speaking crystals that end in *ite are not good for cleansing with water. Selenite will even completely dissolve!\n\nAnother way of cleansing your crystals would be by burying the stones in the earth for at least 24 hours. I do this when I am back home in the Netherlands, where the ground is a little bit more fertile and there is more plant energy in the soil. Here in Dubai, where most people live in apartments, finding \u2018fresh soil\u2019 to keep your crystals in safe overnight might be a little more of a problem.\n\nFor this reason I \u2018smudge\u2019 my crystals here in Dubai. You can burn white sage, lavender or sandalwood incense or palo santo wood. I pick up my crystals and while I take each one back and forth through the smoke I ask the Universe (Creator, God, Source, whichever way you would refer to it) to remove all negative energy from the crystals and to cleanse them NOW (important to add that last word!). Then when I feel the crystal is clean and ready, I hold the crystal in my hand and ask it to assist me with whatever intention I set. You only need to do this once, when you are preparing the crystal for its first use.\n\nAfter the cleansing, your crystals need to be recharged. I leave them, on the floor, somewhere near a window but outside of direct sunlight. Some crystals change colour or overall cannot handle too much sun.\nThe energy for recharging is strongest around the full moon. After putting them on the floor, I ask for the sun and moon to recharge the power and strength of the crystals in the next 24 hours.\nAfter the recharge I only smudge the stones after each client. The crystals I wear for myself I only cleanse in the above way once a month.\n\nFinally, what to do when a crystal breaks? When you drop a crystal or it comes apart by itself, I usually return it back to Mother Earth. You can do so by burying it or dropping it into the sea, accompanied by some kind words to thank the stone for being with you and helping you. It breaks my heart sometimes! But I always remember and am grateful for the time the crystal spent with me. And I hope you enjoy the time you spend with your crystals!\n\n\nDo reach out to me if you have any questions regarding crystals or if you are interested in acquiring any; I sell cleansed and pre-programmed crystals and bracelets too!",

Love is the secret why people are successful or not.

You have to visualize the money, because the Law of Attraction believes things which are visualized as being real.

        "text":"sermon deliveryMaking sermons is a must for every minister especially that we use to preach. Whenever we preach, we make sermons.\n\nUsually, veteran pastors don\u2019t do sermon manuscripts. They simply know what they are to say and deliver. They usually practice with their minds.\n\nOn the other hand, there are pastors that use sermon manuscripts just like me. I find it hard to preach without sermon manuscripts. But it doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t preach without it. In fact, I can. It is simply harder than when I have one.\n\nWhether you have a sermon manuscripts or not, the tips below in making and delivering sermon is very much applicable. So I highly suggest that you take note of this.\n\nTips On How To Make\u00a0 And Deliver a Better Sermon\n\nPresent the points in positive way \u2013 There are lots of ways in presenting your sermon. You can do a progressive presentation, regressive presentation, enumeration form of presentation, point by point presentation, etc. No matter how you present your sermon points, present it in a positive form.\n\nI really find it to have better results than presenting the sermon points in a negative way. To give you an example, consider this point:\n\nOriginal: Wearing indecent dress in the church is wrong.\n\nRevised: Wear better dress in coming church.\n\nHighlight the positive things \u2013 Once you start developing positive format of sentence, you will have a better chance of highlighting positive things in the passage rather than the negative.\n\nExample: Matthew 5:3 \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n\nHighlighting \u201cpoor in spirit\u201d will be more likely a negative presentation. But highlighting \u201cfor theirs is the kingdom of heaven\u201d will be more likely a positive presentation.\n\nBe creative in making points \u2013 There are several ways in implementing creativeness in making points. It is best if you will apply simple mnemonics. You can do some acronym like KISS (Keep It Short and Simple) and PUSH (Pray Until Somethings Happens).\n\nYou can also try using simple words starting with the same letters. Or you can start your points with the same 2 or 3 three words before the points.\n\nUse good sermon illustrations \u2013 Illustrations are hard to find. You will need to do a little research in order to find a good one. I already have compiled some illustrations that you may want to check out. In choosing a good illustration, kindly visit my article that talks about hunting a good sermon illustrations.\n\nBe creative in delivering sermon and illustration \u2013 Once you got a good sermon illustration, you should accompany it with creativeness. Just a few days ago, my friend Ptr. Eric Ortega, a professional story teller, taught me a good way to tell a story which can also be extremely useful in telling a serrmon illustration. I will cover the \u201chow\u2019s\u201d of telling a story later. I can assure you, it is very rewarding to learn some skills on being creative.\n\nFocus on God and not on men \u2013 It\u2019s always better to focus on God all the time. People will disappoint you but not God. People may fail you, but not God.\n\nDelivering sermon can really be painful at times especially when people tries to control you on what you are going to preach instead of what God is telling you to preach. But guess what, all you have to do is to stick with God and everything will just be fine.\n\nFor God is our greatest encourager and encouragement.\n\nTry to keep this 6 simple tips in mind while you make sermon manuscripts and deliver sermons.
