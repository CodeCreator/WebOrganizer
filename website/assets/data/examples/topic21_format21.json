        "text":"Facebook pixel\n\nSeptember Ambassador\n\nQ&A with Vistoria Bassett\n\nVictoria Bassett is a T44 100m and 200m para-sprinter and PhD student based in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Victoria was born with Bilateral Talipes, a congenital disability that affects the shape and direction of the foot in such a way that requires correction throughout childhood. She has recently earned a place on the British Athletics Futures Pathway, which sets her on the path of competing at the Paris 2024 Paralympics. We are delighted to be able to play a small part in supporting her journey \u2013 her first major goal is to compete in the 2022 Kobe Para Athletics World Championships!\n\nHow did you get involved in para-sprinting?\n\nI got involved in para-sprinting in my last year of undergraduate study. I\u2019d always been into running when I was younger (mainly long distance, rather ironically), but then I reached a certain age \u2013 as many do \u2013 where I became disinterested in sport and stopped doing it altogether. Throughout my childhood and adolescence I had never seen myself as disabled (despite knowing that I had a physical condition), let alone likely to pursue sport as a career so I didn\u2019t really think about para-sport, let alone para sprinting. It wasn\u2019t until I saw someone else competing at the 2012 Paralympics who had the same disability as me that I was inspired to give it a go. After that, I got classified as a para-athlete and the rest is history!\n\nWhat has been your greatest para-sport achievement?\u00a0\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s the emails I get asking for advice or saying how they\u2019ve been inspired to try the sport as a disabled athlete! I\u2019m very proud to have won a number of medals and to have been invited to compete alongside some of the greatest and most decorated athletes in para-sport, but nothing makes me feel better than getting that \u2018I just wanted to say\u2019 email. \u00a0\n\nWhat motivates you to keep training and compete to the best of your ability?\u00a0\n\nI really love working hard, it\u2019s in my nature. I love working to prove to the world (and myself) what I know I\u2019m capable of. What are my competitors doing right now? Are they slacking or are they on the grind? And what am I going to do to respond to that? \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWhat are your aspirations in para-sprinting for 2022 and beyond?\n\nNext year is the 2022 World Para Athletics Championships. I just missed out on Europeans this year so I\u2019m determined to get a decent winter of training under my belt and step up the game.\n\nHow important is nutrition for para-sprinting?\n\nLike any sport \u2013 competitive or not \u2013 nutrition is everything! It\u2019s the difference between being able to smash every session and getting the bare minimum out of your training.\u00a0 I work hard already so why make it any harder?!\n\nGrowing up, who was your all-time inspirational sportsperson?\n\nVictoria Pendleton. I love that someone so talented is able to completely throw themselves into the sport. Women are so underrepresented in the sport I was in awe of her ability to compete in the pretty masucline sport of track cycling \u2013 and become Olympic champion in the process! \u2013 and then the \u2013 arguably more male-dominated discipline of \u2013 national hunt racing. Two completely different sports. Loads of people expected her to fail and she smashed it out of the park. Now that\u2019s inspiring.\u00a0\n\nWhat advice would you give to a young, aspiring para-athlete?\u00a0\n\nJust GO for it! There are so many things that hold people with disabilities back from participating in sport, public opinion often being one of them, but if you won\u2019t show the world what you can do, who will?\n\nWhat interests do you have outside of para-sprinting?\n\nI\u2019m a PhD student with an interest in women\u2019s rights, sustainability and politics. I\u2019ve started a podcast called Women with Disabilities. Keep your eyes peeled for some developments\u2026\n\nDescribe your perfect weekend.\u00a0\n\nFresh coffee, a nice big bowl of porridge and a Beet It shot to start a slow morning before I go to training. After that, I have a long and luxurious shower with lots of essential oils and self-care. In the afternoon I\u2019ll head to Sheffield\u2019s famous Sharrowvale road to get my treat for the week (usually a vegan DoNot from Olive and Joy) on my way to catch up with friends or visit the Peak District with my partner. In the evening I\u2019ll make a lovely pasta dish (I love Italian food) and settle down to watch a film before heading to bed for an early night.\n\nHow has Beet It Sport helped your performance?\n\nBeet It Shots are the perfect supplement to get me through those painful hill sessions and speed endurance training. They\u2019re particularly useful during winter \u2013 when training is at its hardest \u2013 they help my body to get more oxygen to where I need it so I can focus on making sure that the last rep is as good as my first. You never know, that last rep could be the difference between gold and silver\u2026",

        "text":"February 21, 2013\n\nFacebook Mail\n\n\nErrol Strachan is not only a living legend in the South African music scene but a living legend in South Africa\u2019s skateboarding history. If you have never heard of Errol Strachan aka BONG you about to get educated.\n\n\n1. Could you give us a brief introduction on who you are, age and a summary of your life with regards to skateboarding and msic?.\n\nHello \u2013 I am Bong, 51 years, I old started skateboarding in 1975, at age 13. I started in the same skate era that the Lords of Dogtown Movie depicts. I skated for 25 years nonstop since, practically every day, and stopped skating at around age 38\/39.\n\nI grew up in an area that had no facilities and due to apartheid we were not really easily allowed into places that had ramps, and least of all pools, so I naturally became a Freestyle\/Flatland trick skater. My friends and I had a skate club in Grassy Park called \u201cComets\u201d Skate Club and we used to imitate the tricks we saw Tony Alva and the Boys do in the then popular \u201cSkateboarder\u201d magazine.\n\nSkateboarding was pretty much a \u201cfad\u201d sport in South Africa, it came and went like a fashion style. So when its popularity declined, many of my friends stopped skating, but Myself and a handful continued to skate. That\u2019s also when Thrasher magazine surfaced in the USA \u2013 this was the early 80\u2019s. We knew there were other skaters around, but we never really made much contact with these people \u2013 It was not accepted really for colored kids to have white friends and was actually frowned upon, in the late 70\u2019s \/ early 80\u2019s.\n\nThen I got into Reggae and Rastafarianism and my life changed radically- I was also introduced to Reggae music and due to the politically turbulent times I was in I found this a fitting culture to adopt. That\u2019s also when I started growing my dreadlocks, around 1983. I also started playing music \u2013 I started The Sons of Selassie Reggae band with 2 other friends \u2013 and the band is still going strong to this day \u2013 28 years later!\n\nI spent some time in Johannesburg playing music \u2013 it was there that I met 2 small kids 8\/9 years old called Greg Finch and Dallas Oberholzer. I was probably around 29 years old. They saw me demo skate at some shopping centres and used to hang out with me once or twice when they got a chance to come through.\n\nI got back to Cape Town and as I arrived my friends told me that they were hosting the first ever South African National Skateboarding contest \u2013 and it included Freestyle. So I entered and won it. And I won the next one, and the next one as they happened annually, won a few of those until 1993 when I stopped skating contests. That\u2019s also when I opened my skate shop.\n\nFrom there I mostly focussed on family work and music.\n\n2. You had a distinct skateboarding style back in the day. In a time of half pipes and big tricks what made you follow this kind of style?\n\nWe had no other facilities really than flat land. SO we all resorted to trick skating.\n\n3. Who were your biggest influences as a skateboarder growing up?\n\nRodney Mullen, Per Welinder, any good pro and rated freestyle skaters mostly. I would also admire the rest but they were not really influences\n\n4. How did you get into skateboarding?\n\nI saw someone skating, and fell in love with what I saw\u2026 and said: \u201cI am going to do that!\u201d\n\n5. Do you prefer the skate scene of the good old days to the current skate scene?\n\nI am not sure. What I can say from what I see is this: The sport has evolved radically to become more extreme. I doubt there are any more technical skaters than what I saw when I skated in the 90\u2019s just everything got bigger and more intense.\n\n6. You play in the band The Rudimentals. Have you played in other bands?\n\nYes, Sons of Selassie, Roots Rockers, Blunt (the Blunt Skate Magazine was named by myself and it was named after my hip hop band I had at them time, although it took on its own personality, I named that MAG!), A few other reggae bands, Braindead and then Rudimentals. I had some gaps between bands, as I also stopped playing music for a while when I lost a good friend. I was bummed out about that.\n\n\n7. How was your experience running your shop \u201cBongs\u201d\n\nFun but hard. We imported stuff and it killed us. The excon rate fluctuated so badly that in 2 years we had to double up on selling price and that\u2019s when we called it a day \u2013 But we knew that we had a major rep as it was a real skate shop run by real skaters for skaters. Kids cried when we closed it. If I were well off and born with a silver spoon I would have kept that going, but simply could not afford to.\n\n8. What are the future plans for Bong?\n\nPlay Music, Work, Breath, Live, Love, the same as yesterday and the day before and the day before\u2026.",

The southpaw also shined in the Arizona Fall League, with a 2-1 record and a 1.95 ERA in seven starts and 27 and two-thirds innings pitched.\n\nDespite the lofty expectations going into his third year in the Marlins organization, the 2012 first round selection out of Oklahoma State is focused on improving in 2014, regardless where he begins the year.\n\nAs he prepares for spring training, Heaney spoke with Suns broadcaster Roger Hoover to review his 2013 campaign, his busy offseason, and his expectations for the year ahead.\n\nHoover: First of all how has the offseason gone for you and what have you been working on?\n\nHeaney: Well I got home in the middle of November, took about three days off. Then I worked out, started doing baseball stuff again. Then I had Thanksgiving with the family and then really got going after that. I'm working on being in better cardio shape, really working on flexibility and trying to really stay healthy. Being healthy is a key for me this year, I was pretty disappointed that I started the season off hurt last year. So now I'm throwing bullpens and just getting ready to go.\n\nHoover: You got drafted in June 2012, then finished the season seeing some time with the GCL Marlins and Greensboro, was there an adjustment in 2013 going through a full season as a professional pitcher?\n\nHeaney: I felt more comfortable. I knew faces in the organization, knew how things worked, just some of the do's and don'ts of Minor League Baseball. I think I did a good job of not screwing up too much in my first year, but it was nice to have some guys that I knew, some friendly faces. Playing-wise, I got a good introduction when I went to Greensboro my first year. I feel like from then on out I've had a good grasp on how to approach the game.\n\nHoover: You suffered a strain lat muscle during last year's spring training, how frustrating was it for you to start the regular season on the disabled list and then how did you get things going when you made it to the Hammerheads in May?\n\nHeaney: It was really frustrating because I've never been hurt before. I've never had a pulled hamstring, sore bicep, I've never had to miss a game before. So it's a different deal to figure out how to deal with that and how to approach rehab with the same intensity that you approach pitching in a game. So that was frustrating to really want to have a good first season and set the bar for myself and then to get out of the gates and get hurt, it was like I'm already behind the 8-ball. I'm glad though with Gene Basham and all the guys in the rehab, they did a really good job of making sure I pace myself. Every day I was like 'hey I want to throw this far, I want to do this and this,' and they did a good job of telling me no. They told me I wasn't in a race with anybody. I think that really showed when I got back to Jupiter, I felt like it took me 2-3 weeks to really get adjusted to the game and pitching again. I really think that's a lot of credit to them and making sure I was 100 percent healthy and not running me out there too quick.\n\nHoover: What was the transition like going from the Hammerheads to the Suns and getting your first taste of Double-A baseball at the end of the season?\n\nHeaney: It was awesome. Anthony DeSclafani had been moved up, and so had Justin Nicolino before me, so it was nice to get there and the first day I was there they helped me figure out where to go for things and they made it so much easier. I'm kind of a self-conscious guy so in transitions I don't want to be that guy that does something stupid or steps on toes or anything like that. So it was nice to have those guys to hang out with, bounce some ideas off of and stuff. And then with Andy Barkett and all the rest of the staff, I mean they're just cool as hell. They just accept you for who you are and they let you go play and they love you for it. I really enjoyed playing for them too.\n\nHoover: What did you like about your pitching coach John Duffy and what do you feel like he helped you with at the end of the year?\n\nHeaney: I think with Duff, you can tell that guy wants to compete more than anything. If you want to do towel drills for two hours, he'll stand there and talk with you about doing a towel drill for two hours. Some guys hate it, some guys love it, but you can't question that the guy wants what's best for you and wants you to succeed. For me we worked on a lot of going out of the stretch, being a little quicker to the plate, working on my move to first. I still have a ways to go, I've been working on it this year but I really think we figured out how to do it. That's instead of a lot of coaches telling you to do it this way, and if that didn't work for me he really sat down and worked with me on figuring out what's the best way to do it that's comfortable for me that didn't affect how I pitch. I really appreciated that.\n\nHoover: Then once the Suns season was over, you got to go to Arizona to pitch in the Arizona Fall League. How do you feel you performed there, especially getting to go against some of the top hitting prospects in baseball?\n\nHeaney: I felt really good. I wasn't nervous but I was anxious to get out there and see what the competition was like and see how it stacked up to some of the Double-A competition I've faced. There were some really good players out there, we had good players on our team. So it was really fun to go out there and really test yourself against the best in the minor leagues. I felt like I did well, I was really happy, I walked away with no regrets.\n\nHoover: Where there any other AFL prospects that stood out or guys that proved to be a tough out for you?\n\nHeaney: There were a lot of good guys there. A guy on our team named Alex Meyer, pitcher for the Twins organization, I charted him pretty much every time he threw. And he was just unbelievable. He's out there throwing 97-100 miles per hour every single time with his fastball. A nasty curveball, he's a 6-8 righty, you can't ask for anything more out of a pitcher. So he was unbelievable. The other thing that struck me that I thought was pretty crazy was the amount of hitters in the Chicago Cubs organization. They had Kris Bryant who they just drafted, Jorge Soler, Albert Almora, they had all of these guys on their team in Mesa. So every time we faced them I was just like, 'man this Cubs organization just runs out position players that are just really good hitters.'\n\nHoover: Also talking about your offseason we understand that you got married in January and had a lot of Suns and Marlins organization teammates there to celebrate the big day with you.\n\nHeaney: It was awesome to have a lot of guys from the Suns come out. We had a great time and it really showed me how good of friends we were that those guys would be willing to come from Florida, New Jersey, Indiana or Texas, they just came from everywhere in the middle of winter to Oklahoma. The fact that they would come out and support myself and my wife like that it just made me really happy. So that was really awesome to have the feeling being so loved by those guys, it was great.\n\nHoover: How would you describe your pitching repertoire and what you're trying to do with each pitch?\n\nHeaney: I throw a four-seam fastball, I get some good run and a little bit of sink on it. I throw pretty much four-seamers every time, never really throw two-seam fastballs. My second pitch I usually go to would be slider. I started throwing that in the summer between my sophomore and junior year at the Cape Cod League. And my junior year at Oklahoma State I really finally got a real good feel for it. So I'm confident getting that as a putout pitch. And then mixing in changeups when I'm behind in the count or in a hitters count I can be confident throwing that for strikes, getting some off-balance swings or ground balls early in the count. So I'm just really working on being able to throw everything for a strike and keeping sliders away from bats when I really need a strikeout or swing-and-a-miss.\n\nHoover: You're heading down to Jupiter soon to get going with Spring Training. What's your mindset going into spring and where do you hope to start the season?\n\nHeaney: I'm going in there hoping that I can stand out and I can go out there and pitch well and make them consider putting me on the roster to start the season. Whether that happens or not, it's in my control in terms of how I play but that's not my decision to make. My goal is to just go out there and pitch as well as I can, obviously stay healthy and not be hurt. That's a minor goal for me. And then to be able to pitch in a big league spring training game would be really great. So I have some minor goals and some major goals but I just want to go out there and play the best I can.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor the latest Suns news this offseason, fans are encouraged to visit and can keep up with the Jacksonville Suns on the club's Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram social media platforms, as well as the \"Tales from Bragan Field\" blog:\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues or its clubs.

        "text":"AME Athlete Highlight\n\nSeptember 29, 2021\n\nMeet Gabrielle!\n\nGabbi has been training and racing for multi-sport and endurance events since 2016. Since then, she has completed close to thirty triathlons, running events and distance open water swims. Her accomplishments span from sprint distance triathlons and 5k\u2019s through IRONMAN.\n\nGabbi joined the AME team early 2021. Her greatest goal this year was to complete her first IRONMAN, IRONMAN Maryland, which she just completed a few weeks ago! Throughout the year, she also completed, PR\u2019d and\/or placed in her age group in four other events, including two triathlons, a one-mile open water swim and a century ride.\n\nGrowing up, Gabbi was a competitive swimmer. With swimming her strongest leg, her goals for this year also included building speed and endurance on the bike and run while continuing to build and improve in the swim. She nailed her goals for this year, increasing her speed and endurance in all three legs of the sport. She hit her greatest milestones from a volume perspective in all three aspects, while building greater confidence and enjoyment in the bike and run. Since February, Gabbi has improved her swim speed threshold by 8%, her bike power threshold by 16% and her run speed threshold by over 5%! For 2022, her goals are to continue to excel, PR and podium at sprint distance triathlons and distance open water swims.\n\nGabbi is an absolute joy to have on the team. She loves the camaraderie, support, encouragement, and friendships that have stemmed from the AME team and the Wild Harbor Triathlon Club. She has a beautiful family with her incredibly supportive husband and pup, Luca.\n\nWe are THRILLED Gabbi chose AME to share in her journey!\n\nQ &\u00a0A with Gabbi:\n\nWhat got you into triathlon and endurance events?\n\nWhen I turned 30, I was having a bit of a mid-life crisis. I decided to create a \"30 before 31\" bucket list. A list of 30 things I could do before my next birthday that would celebrate this time in my life and lead me on an adventure. The list was a bit schizophrenic in the sense that it had a huge range of items: reading, cooking etc... One of the items on my list was to \"do a triathlon\" and I signed up for TriAC. At the time, I didn't know if I could bike ten miles let alone run a 5K after. I had never been an \"athlete\" so to speak. I had so much anxiety leading into the training and race, I was terrified. One night, while watching the news I saw a segment on \"things to do at the shore\", and there was Val, Maggie & Lisa talking about the \"Wild Harbor Triathlon Club\". I signed up for their \"Mock Triathlon\" and that was it. I was hooked! Their kindness, energy and spirit was what drew me in and I knew I had found my tribe. I joined the club soon after and they helped push me to the finish line at TriAC that summer. Triathlon has made me broke ever since.\n\nWhat is your favorite event and why?\n\nTriAC by far. There's a little bit of nostalgia there since it was my first race. I also love swimming, biking and running through the city, seeing the characters on the boardwalk and finishing with such a rowdy crowd. The fast\/flat course also is a plus.\n\nWhat about triathlon and endurance sport brings you the most joy?\n\nI love the people. This sounds silly since it's a very individual sport, but it allows me to have friends and meet others who I would never otherwise have the opportunity to. \u00a0Through triathlon, I have made friends that were older, younger, of different backgrounds and have different political or religious views than my own. Without them, I wouldn't have the well-rounded view of the world that I do now. Without them, I wouldn't be able to race as fiercy. Without them, the sport would be flat out BORING. Coming into transition and seeing old friends, greeting each other, cheering each other on and celebrating at the finish line makes all the hours of training and sometimes the loneliness that comes with that training worth it. The people make triathlon joyful.\n\nNow that you have completed your first IRONMAN, what next event finish line would mean the most to you?\n\nNothing will beat the finish at IRONMAN Maryland, but I think getting back to sprint tris and being able to be a little more competitive in my age group will mean a lot as we head into 2022. I'm also very much looking forward to having a little fun at the Key West Triathlon in December (beer in my bike bottles? Maybe!). \u00a0\n\nWhat has been the most valuable takeaway from your training so far?\n\nI have two - 1. Progress is progress, no matter how small or large. It is so hard when we are \"in it\" to see the big picture. This is something that I struggled with tremendously at the beginning of IRONMAN training. I would get frustrated when I couldn't see or feel progress in the big strides the way I was used to. There's progress being made every time we head to the pool, go out for a ride or hit the pavement for a run. As they say \"There's no such thing as a bad workout\". This is why it's so important to keep track of workouts and reflect back on them every so often. Thinking back to that first Sprint TriAC then to last weekend at IRONMAN Maryland, I am so proud of how much progress I've made. 2. Don't be so hard on yourself. Give yourself some grace every once in a while. Triathletes tend to be type-A (guilty!) and giving ourselves a break is never the first solution for many of us. I've had to learn that some days things just go wrong, and slowing down and taking a timeout is alright and won't destroy our fitness. This mentality got me to the finish line in Maryland. Forward progress is progress no matter how slow or small.\n\nPick your pain, another 2.4 mile jellyfish swim or realizing you ran off course and added an extra half a mile during an IRONMAN run?\n\nI'll take those jellyfish ANYDAY! After 26.2 miles running\/walking and crawling there's no way I'm going another step!\n\nWhat is one thing you want people to know about you?\n\nGet ready for a 76ers reference: Trust the Process. It may hurt, it may be exhausting, but there's a reason for some of the crazy workouts we are given. When I first started with Coach Ashley, I thought she may be trying to kill me with some of the speed workouts she was programming, (we all know how much I \"LOVE\" the run). I had to really change my mindset and relinquish some control when it came to training and trust that there was a plan in place to get me to the finish line, even if I couldn't see it at all times. \u00a0IRONMAN training takes sacrifice and grit, committing to the process is the first step. Tri On!\n\nLet's Get Started!\nI have the education, experience, passion and energy to help you accomplish your dreams.\nPhilippians 4:13\nI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.",

Just something you\u2019ve got to stay on. It\u2019s something that I had earlier. It was starting to get better, then just had a little setback. So it\u2019s just something you\u2019ve got to stay on for the rest of the year, probably.\nOn what he can work on in practice:\nIt\u2019s just good to be able to stay in hockey shape. Hopefully, just get a better response the next couple of days from the injury. Hopefully, just move on from there and don\u2019t have any more problems with it.\nOn if he\u2019ll play this weekend:\nI haven\u2019t talked about that with the coaches. Just trying to get better every day. This is just a step in the right direction. Hopefully I\u2019ll feel better (Friday).\nOn how careful he has to be with it:\nIt\u2019s just something you have to stay on so it doesn\u2019t get any worse. I think with any injury, there\u2019s always the risk of reinjuring it so you just try to get back as close as you can to 100 percent.\nOn taking care of those types of injuries now versus later:\nIt\u2019s tough. I think my stubbornness gets the best of me sometimes. Sunday, I go in and I probably shouldn\u2019t play, but your stubbornness just takes over because you want to be competitive. I think you\u2019ve just got to be smart about it and realize the games now are important, but you want to be around in a month. You don\u2019t want to set yourself back for that time of the season.\n\nSteve Sullivan\n\nOn the core guys that play through injuries:\nYou are going to have injuries every season. You\u2019re going to have guys that can\u2019t play all 82 (games). It\u2019s very rare to see how many years a player has in his career where he can play a full season. Its just bumps and bruises along the way. We\u2019ve got a few guys who\u2019ve played all the games and we have a lot of guys who have missed. It\u2019s typical of most seasons.\n\nOn the difficulties of back-to-back games:\nThe last couple of weeks we\u2019ve been getting some good breaks with only one game during the week, giving us a chance to have off and some practice days. I think that the back-to-back games on Saturday and Sunday, being afternoon games, that helps, too. You are still getting a good night\u2019s rest. You\u2019re not going sleepless until 2, 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. You\u2019re able to get to bed at a reasonable time after the first game. That gives you a really good chance to be as close to 100 percent as possible for Game 2.\n\nOn how the rest affects the team\u2019s performance especially this past weekend:\nI couldn\u2019t answer that. I think you hope that on Game 2 you are bringing the same energy and the same focus of Game 1 of a back-to-back. Hopefully, we\u2019ll do that this weekend.\n\nAssists: Michelle Crechiolo & Brittany Goncar\n\n1:38 PM:\nCoachspeak with Dan Bylsma\u2026\n\nOn re-assigning O\u2019Reilly:\nIt was a numbers situation. I thought his first 3-4 games were his best with us, playing with (Steve) Sullivan and (Tyler) Kennedy. I\u2019m confident in what he can do on the ice. It is a numbers situation at this point in time. Playing games and getting acquainted with our system as well (in Wilkes-Barre\/Scranton) is something better than just sitting here and watching games.\n\nOn improved defensive-zone coverage against the Rangers:\nWhen I looked at the replay of the game, (our D-zone coverage) would be one area where I would want to get better at from the game. I think when you play the game in the offensive zone, you dictate more, you play against a tired team and you get better opportunities to play defense quickly. I think we did have that in that game. There were times when we had them hemmed in and didn\u2019t allow them to play offense with the speed. That was a real big part of that game. When you\u2019re playing D-zone coverage against a good team, you sometimes have to let them have the puck. Those are situations we want to avoid having. We want to get to those situations where we have those shifts and those extended O-zone times \u2013 those situations where you can tire the other team out when they\u2019re playing defense.\n\nOn Tampa Bay and Columbus:\nI think Tampa Bay has started to play a little bit differently in their system. They\u2019re not as stout at playing the 1-3-1 that we saw from them (previously), where the game was getting clogged in the neutral zone and really tough to play against. They\u2019ve changed a little bit. We played a team a couple weeks ago that had won a lot of games in a row and were making a push. Every game was a like a playoff type of game. They have skilled players. (Steven) Stamkos is playing really well right now. So is (Martin) St. Louis. They have skill players that can do damage 5-on-5 and power play-wise. System-wise is a little bit different. With Columbus, I haven\u2019t watched them yet and scouted them. I watched a few games on TV. They look right now like they\u2019re playing hard. They played really hard against the Rangers. I thought that was a game where they did a lot of good things and played with speed. They worked hard and were aggressive. I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ll look to see (if that\u2019s) because of the trade deadline and where they\u2019re at. They\u2019re playing hard. They don\u2019t have the pressure of a playoff race or that type of pressure. But they\u2019re going out and playing hard right now. We\u2019ll look at and that and expect that on Sunday.\u00a0\n\nOn putting Vitale between Cooke and Asham:\nOne of the deciding factors in that game for our centermen \u2013 \u2018Joey V\u2019 and Craig Adams \u2013 was having a little bit more size down the middle against (the Rangers) bottom two centermen. Brian Boyle is a really big andstrong guy that\u2019s tough in the faceoff circle, so we wanted to have Joey V and Craig Adams in that spot. (John) Mitchell is their other centerman. He was a bigger guy in the middle of the ice as well that we were looking to contendagainst and wanted to have some centermen that could counteract that. Whether it was the speed and tenacity of Joey V or size down the middle, that was kind of what we were looking for from the Cooke-Vitale-Asham line. I thought Joey V did it with the speed and tenacity he showed in the game.\nOn the Rangers purposely getting wingers thrown out of the faceoff circle:\nAs far as that move, I think it\u2019s a good tactical move. It\u2019s something we may or may not have talked about every time we have an icing. The one thing that I think that is not as prevalent in our game as before is if you get kicked out of a faceoff twice, there\u2019s a penalty. That penalty (I\u2019m going to knock on wood real quick here), is one we haven\u2019t seen as much. You\u2019re getting a guy kicked out with the knowledge that the next guy coming in might be the guy you really want to take the draw to gain some time. I think it was a good tactic on their part. When they put the winger in there, you know they\u2019re buying themselves a few extra seconds to get a breath and to get their feetunder them.\nOn how Tangradi\u2019s defensive game has evolved compared to a year ago:\nThe details in Eric\u2019s game have come a long way in the last two years. I think his attention to the details \u2013 wall play and puck management in the defensive zone \u2013 is significantly higher than it was two years ago for Eric. He\u2019s a guy who\u2019s a bigger body, is good along the walls, is a physical guy for us and has also got to be counted on to be out in defensive positions and be good there. Because he can do that, he can be put out and counted on in different situations, which I think he\u2019s really improved on over the course of the last two years of his career with us.\nOn if Fleury gets overlooked as an elite goaltender:\nI can\u2019t quite explain exactly why that would happen at all. This guy has won a ton of hockey games. He\u2019s won big games. He\u2019s won playoff games. He\u2019s won Game 7s. He\u2019s won a Stanley Cup. He\u2019s certainly extremely talented and he continues to win a lot of hockey games. Maybe our team has not counted on him over the past eight years or seven years like some other goalies have, but this guy has been a huge factor for our team. He\u2019s gone on huge runs when the team needed him to in \u201908 and \u201909. The consistency with which he\u2019s played over the last two years has gone way up with his game-to-game and how he plays the game. If you can tell me why someone might overlook this guy\u2019s talent and what he does for our team, I can\u2019t explain it because I think this year, he\u2019s putting up a year where we\u2019ve counted on him enormously in net and he\u2019s been very good for us. He\u2019s won games, he\u2019s played solid in games, he\u2019s been consistent and he\u2019s come up with big saves. I think he\u2019s right up there with all the goalies in the league at the top.\n\nFade into you: Michelle Crechiolo\n\n1:01 PM:\nHead coach Dan Bylsma had a few injury updates...\n  \u2022 Kennedy (high-ankle sprain) skated before practice\n  \u2022 Orpik practiced and is still day-to-day (upper-body)\n  \u2022 No change in Crosby's status (concussion-like symptoms). He skated with team, but did not do contact drills\n  \u2022 Johnson was back from illness\n  \u2022 Niskanen missed the practice because he was sick\n\"Tyler Kennedy skated by himself earlier this morning in his progression,\" Bylsma said. \"Brooks Orpik was back on the ice, f...

        "text":"Sauber preview quotes 2012 Monaco GP \u2013 Monte Carlo\n\nKamui Kobayashi drives to place fifth in 2011 Monaco GP \u00a9 Sauber\n\nKamui Kobayashi: \u201cI have good memories of Monaco. I finished fifth there last year, which was really great. Monaco is a very special track for the drivers. Our car seems to be strong on most of the tracks. Now it will be interesting to see how competitive it will be on a street circuit, but I\u2019m quite confident it will be strong there as well. In Monaco a lot of things can happen, therefore it\u2019s important to stay out of trouble and make it to the end. If we do that then I\u2019m sure we will be able to fight for points.\u201d\n\nSergio Perez: \u201cThis Grand Prix is the most special one for me. I have been waiting to race in the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix all my life and, of course, after what happened last year I am looking forward to it even more. I strongly believe on this track the driver can make more of a difference than on any other track. As a team we are in good shape and I want to keep that momentum for Monaco. I also think our car can perform quite well on that unique city circuit. Of course I also think back to the accident I had in Q3 last year. To me it is like a watershed event in my career. There is a time before and a time after the accident. I learnt a lot from what I had to go through and I think it made me stronger. I really want to show what I can do in Monte Carlo.\u201d\n\nMatt Morris, Chief Designer: \u201cThe Monaco track is probably the one where the driver has the most influence on the overall performance. Last year both our drivers were competitive \u2013 Sergio until his accident in Q3, and Kamui finished a strong fifth in the race. The main challenge for setting up the car will be to optimise the mechanical grip. I\u2019m confident we will be able to handle this. The development package that we ran for the first time in Barcelona will also be used again in Monaco, so we will be able to carry over its performance gain. Pirelli will provide us with the soft and the super soft tyres. This is actually the first time this year that we will be using the super soft compound during a race weekend. We tested it briefly during winter testing in Barcelona, which is a track that\u2019s not exactly suited to this tyre, but I don\u2019t see us having any problems in managing this tyre compound. The track has been resurfaced in some areas, for example in the braking zone after the tunnel, so we have got rid of the bump there. That\u2019s something the drivers have to get used to, but, if anything, it should be easier. One of the design considerations of the C31 was to improve it over the kerbs, so we should be stronger at kerbing compared to last year. We have been competitive so far this season, and I\u2019m confident we can be very strong in Monaco as well.\u201d\n\nAll material and photos are copyrighted material and owned by their respective owners.

        "text":"Legends praise Giggs\n\nOld Trafford legends Denis Irwin and Lou Macari were united in praise of Ryan Giggs following the Reds' 2-0 win at Queens Park Rangers on Saturday.\n\nGiggs, making his 999th appearance in senior football (931 for United, 64 for Wales, four for Team GB), scored the game's second goal to seal three vital points in the race for the Barclays Premier League title.\n\nIrwin and Macari, speaking on MUTV's Matchday Live programme, waxed lyrical about the Welshman following a performance that earned Giggs a nomination in ManUtd.com's Man of the Match poll.\n\n\"There have been times this season, last season and the season before when people were writing him off but he's a top professional,\" Lou Macari said. \"He keeps bouncing back and doing what he's done at QPR. Did he look nearly 40? I don't think so. He flew about the pitch, he got on the ball, his passing was good.\n\n\"The biggest indicator as to how good he is: the manager keeps picking him. Sir Alex doesn't mess around here at Manchester United. He lets players go at times when supporters aren't sure why, but he knows things we don't know.\n\n\"It's the same for the people he keeps. If he keeps Giggs and Paul Scholes that's because he has a belief that they have something to offer. And they go out onto the pitch and prove the manager's right. To write Giggsy or Scholesy off is a silly thing to do. They can have a poor game, but that happens to the best of players, let alone players approaching 40 years of age.\"\n\nDenis Irwin added: \"He's dedicated, too. You should see him in training. And don't forget, he started as a winger, an out-and-out winger who ran up and down the touchline, scoring goals, creating goals.\n\n\"He was in the centre of the park on Saturday and he got around and did his defensive duties well. Like Lou says, he's good enough to play. If he wasn't good enough for this club the manager wouldn't play him.\n\n\"Sir Alex trusts him, he knows it's going to be a tough game and yet he sticks him in the centre of the park and he scores a great goal. He's a fantastic player, he really is.\n\n\"To play 999 games is unbelievable. He had problems with his hamstrings in his 20s but then started doing yoga. That sorted it out. Obviously the manager's been careful with him over the last eight or nine years, but he's an incredible athlete. There's not an ounce of fat on him.\n\n\"He looks after himself, he trains as hard and intense as he plays on a Saturday. Young players can learn bundles off Giggsy and Scholesy through the way they train and the way they are in the dressing room. Ryan is a very big character in that dressing room - he's not quiet. He's a great professional and played fantastically well on Saturday.\"",

        "text":"Home > Bouldering\n\nWords With Canadian World Cup Competitor Jason Holowach\n\nJason Holowach was part of a history-making Canadian team who competed at the Vail World Cup on June 6.\n\nJason Holowach is the owner of Grip It, a climbing gym in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He\u00a0started climbing when he was nine and his first competition was six months later. His parents sent him on the road with three others to Kelowna where he placed third.\n\nJason Holowach climbing at his own gym, Grip It in Saskatoon.  Photo Pam Eveleigh\nJason Holowach climbing at his own gym, Grip It in Saskatoon. Photo Pam Eveleigh\n\nHe\u2019s competed and won a few youth national championships and titles along with one open national Bouldering championship. He took third at Nationals this year (fourth overall, but American Josh Larson finished in second). He attended three youth world competitions and placed fourth at one.\n\nIn the last two years, he\u2019s competed at the IFSC World cup bouldering circuit and world Championships where he placed 45th overall in the circuit and 19th at the world championships.\n\nAt the Toronto World Cup in May, Holowach finished in 20th and Sean McColl finished in 17th. But, at the Vail World Cup, both climbers were competing at the top of their game.\n\nJason Holowach competing at the Toronto World Cup.  Photo Will Johnson\nJason Holowach competing at the Toronto World Cup. Photo Will Johnson\n\nBoth Holowach and McColl made it into the finals, which was the first time two Canadians have ever competed in a world cup finals. In the end, McColl finished fifth and Holowach seventh. We caught up with Holowach shortly after Vail.\n\nGripped: How long have you been competing?\nHolowach: This year marks the start of my 18th year of competing and my first bouldering world cup was in Hamilton in 2013.\n\nWhat made you want to focus on world cups this year?\nLast year in Munich at the World Championships I had a taste of what I\u2019m capable of. This year I was able to stay healthy which is the biggest challenge for me some years, so with that and along with a shorter World Cup season I am able physically and financially to do so. This is something I have always wanted to do.\n\nHow was Toronto? Was it a warm-upish comp to get in the groove?\nI guess you could say that, but at this level of competition you really have to be on point every step of the way. So to a certain extent it all comes down to your day and everyone else\u2019s day.\n\nWhat are world cup routes like?\nThats a tough question, they for the most part test you on everything. These days our Canadian setters are doing an amazing job of this so I feel like I was fairly well prepared. I think the strongest asset you need with these routes is the ability to stand on your feet.\n\nWhat was it like getting into finals at Vail?\nMaking finals was surreal, I did\u2019t believe it was true until the official results were posted. I reacted in a funny way once it was real though, I guess like any other competitor it was time to prepare for the next round.\n\nThe Vail World Cup men's finals competitors. Sean McColl is on the left end and Jason Holowach on the right end.\nThe Vail World Cup men\u2019s finals competitors. Sean McColl is on the left end and Jason Holowach on the right end.\n\nHow were the routes in semis?\nSemis routes suited me very well.\u00a0The first one being a slab was all about standing on your feet, with a bit of coordination thrown in. I didn\u2019t feel too comfortable on it my feet slipped once but I was able to figure out the high step and finish it off. The second one was almost similar in what the boulder was challenging, coordination but this time compression, all on a low angle again an area I\u2019m fairly comfortable in. The bonus hold was awful but I was able to stay on somehow, that\u2019s what got me through.\u00a0The third was just hard. I feel there were multiple factors not in my favour with that one. I really wish I could have done that first move because the rest looked so fun.\u00a0The fourth was just funky, but I really liked it. I\u2019m not the strongest on steep so when I can use my legs that really helps. Once I got through the roof the bonus was not very good and the lock off to the sloper had to be really high and I came up just shy.\n\nHas Sean McColl helped you along the way?\nSean is a great source of knowledge, his advice whether it\u2019s about comp strategy or preparation always comes in handy.\n\nDid you train hard this winter for the world cup?\nThis year I didn\u2019t try to change things too much, my main focus was to stay healthy and train just enough. I think I was training harder on my training days because I was more motivated but I didn\u2019t train longer or more days, so yea in a way I did.\n\nTwo Canadians in finals, first time. What was it like being in finals with Sean? Dream come true?\nIt really was, however going out first and Sean going out last didn\u2019t allow us time to chat in ISO, so we couldn\u2019t discuss the next one or pump each other up. Next time!\n\nSean McColl exits stage left as Jason Holowach walks on to attempt men's problem number four.  Photo Knut Rokne\nSean McColl exits stage left as Jason Holowach walks on to attempt men\u2019s problem number four. Photo Knut Rokne\n\nWhen you went out for men\u2019s problem number one, what was the energy like at the venue?\nThe energy was crazy, I especially didn\u2019t expect that because I was the new guy and the only one climbing, that was really motivating.\n\nHad you tried a finals\u2019 problems at a world cup before? Are they technically difficult or\u00a0hard to read?\nI had never climbed on the finals problems before, but I do think they tend to be a little easier than the semis routes. I would say they are more showy so they tend to have more jumps and turns and what not. The slab for example that one was very technical and hard to read, so they do have a little of everything still.\n\nYou finished seventh, you must be stoked about that? Looking back, would you change anything that you did?\nVery excited about that. My goal this year was to make a finals and to do it in vail really surprised me. If I were to go back I think I would try problem four the way I knew they wanted us to do it, with the turn. I opted out of that beta because I was worried about my fingers, so I tried it in a more conservative manner.\n\nYou made history today, what was the feedback like from everyone?\nIt was great people were genuinely psyched. It was only a matter of time before someone joined Sean in a finals and I\u2019m just glad it was me.\n\nAre you off to China?\nYou know it! This year will be my first year that I will be able to do the whole circuit, I can\u2019t wait. Now I think my first big challenge in China will be getting around and staying healthy.\n\nAnything else you\u2019d like to add about the comp?\nI just want to say thank you to my fiance Courtney Ellis for the huge support, if only she could be with me in China.\n\nJason Holowach and fiance, Courteny\nJason Holowach and fiance, Courtney Ellis after the Vail World Cup.",

        "text":"P90X creator Tony Horton opens up about working with Eddie Lacy\n\nMichael Cohen\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nGreen Bay \u2014 On Tuesday, the Green Bay Packers held their first OTA workout open to the public, which meant fans and reporters saw a slimmed-down Eddie Lacy for the first time.\u00a0\n\nLacy spent two months of his off-season working out with P90X creator Tony Horton, who appeared in a TMZ video in January saying he could help the struggling running back.\u00a0Horton spoke to the Journal Sentinel on Tuesday afternoon in an exclusive interview detailing his time with Lacy in both Wyoming and California. He estimates that Lacy shed between 15 and 20 pounds.\u00a0\n\nThe following is a portion of the interview between Horton and Michael Cohen. Check back later for a full story based on the interview.\n\nQ: Did this partnership really come about as a social media connection?\n\nA: TMZ was (contacting) me about it, about what I thought. Then (Lacy\u2019s) folks kind of reached out to me and said, \u2018Are you for real? Would you really like to help out Eddie?\u2019 And I had never done anything quite like that before. Obviously I\u2019ve sold a lot of DVDs and worked with a lot of folks in the military and the Pentagon, and I\u2019ve worked with athletes before but never sort of a one-on-one like that where we actually got to hang out and spend almost two months together.\n\nBut I knew I could help him, and I knew what he was struggling from, and I think we both agreed in our meeting that he needed sort of a new perspective and a new approach. And we got along really great. We just met each other up in San Francisco the week before the Super Bowl. And we said hey, let\u2019s give this thing a try. Come hangout with me in Jackson Hole and then after that stint is done we\u2019ll come back to LA and continue it there. We just got along, you know what I mean? We laughed a lot and we worked hard and we ate clean food and just took care of business, you know?\n\nQ: When it came to putting together the workout plans and things like that, was there any input from the Packers, or was it up to you to sort of do what you do?\n\nA: I think the Packers\u2019 opinion was, \u2018Hey man, you\u2019re an adult. It\u2019s the off-season and we just hope you go out there and make good choices.' And they left it up to Eddie and I to get it done. They didn\u2019t really have any impact or say in it. So yeah, there was never really any discussion about that with them.\n\nQ: When we asked Eddie about what the workouts consisted of, he said there were times when he did some boxing, some basketball, some P90X \u2014 what all was he doing?\n\nA: There was everything. I mean everything. I\u2019ve been training folks for 35 years, and so my perspective is the more I got him out of his comfort zone the better. I wasn\u2019t here to run 40s with him or plays or anything like that. I wasn\u2019t here to do football stuff. I mean, I made him do yoga. We went to boxing classes. We did P90X, we did P90X2, we did 22 Minute Hard Corps, we did a lot of my personal workouts. We did pullups and pushups until we couldn\u2019t lift our arms. We did everything. I had him do plyometrics twice a week. And then just pure cardio just to burn calories once a week. We had three days a week that were heavy on the plyometrics and the heart, lungs and legs. Then the other days of the week it was more resistance \u2014 body weight, functional fitness, balance, speed, range of motion and things like that. A lot of core work, which was really important for him.\n\nQ: What types of things were reasonable in terms of expectations going into this?\n\nA:\u00a0There\u2019s one thing I know that works, without having to get too hung up on numbers like weight and inches and the aesthetics. My goal was to help him lose the weight and move athletically six or seven days a week for the duration of our time together, and that\u2019s exactly what we did. We had to do one routine on Fridays which was called Boxes and Balls, which is doing a lot of stablization work on BOSU balls and stability balls and then tons of plyo boxes. It\u2019s a mother. Things that he\u2019s familiar with to some degree as a football player, but a lot of the movements and sequences were brand new to him so it challenged him. Early on, that routine in particular was really tough. But at the end, he was kicking everybody\u2019s ass. Oh my god. I mean, what was awesome about watching Eddie was how quickly he adapted to the exercies. I\u2019m 58 and he\u2019s 25, and most of the guys I train with are in their 30s and 40s. He just went right by us. That was really exciting to watch.\n\nThe other thing too was just getting his diet in order. The problem was caused because of a poor diet. That changed. He didn\u2019t know that healthy food could taste good. I cooked for him a lot of days. It\u2019s not that hard. You make some egg whites and throw some veggies in there. It\u2019s not rocket science. He was excited because he learned that you can make healthy food taste really good, so it\u2019s easier for him to be more consistent with it. In the past \u2014 he\u2019s from New Orleans so there\u2019s a lot of really rich foods. He grew up with that. He\u2019s a crawfish fan. He cut way back on the alcohol, which he learned early on that excess alcohol causes testosterone levels to go down. And that\u2019s all he needed to hear. It was really impressive to see his level of discipline and hard work and willingness to get way outside of his comfort zone. Because he knew what was at stake. It was important to him, so he did it.\n\nQ:\u00a0Was there a target weight you guys wanted to hit?\n\nA:\u00a0No I didn\u2019t even know what he weighed when he came in. And I didn\u2019t know what he weighed when he left. We didn\u2019t want to do that. We wanted to take all the pressure off. We just wanted to have a good time, work really hard and eat clean and drink plenty of water. I had him on some supplements that he had never done. He needed some Vitamin D supplements. We just kind of checked what he needed, and he was low on Vitamin D and fiber. He had never taken a supplement before ever. He\u2019s a genetic freak. But he took it easy there the last year and a half. Just like anybody else, if you don\u2019t pay attention and think you\u2019re going to get by on pure genetics, it\u2019s going to catch up to you. We just made some dietary shifts, some supplement shifts. The company I work for, Beachbody, makes these performance formulas that really made a difference for him, really allowed him to recover from these new kinds of workouts and to have the energy to get in there and progress over the course of two months.\n\nQ: Was he drawing on specific things or comments to fuel him when you guys were working out, or did he just want to work for the sake of being better?\n\nA: We didn\u2019t talk about it that much. I don\u2019t know what motivated him from day to day. He understood based on comments that the coach made, based on comments that his supporters and the people around him were saying, knowing that this is the last year of his contract. He knew what was at stake. But one thing about Eddie, he\u2019s a very humble cat, man. He doesn\u2019t boast (or) any of that stuff, man. He\u2019s just a really good dude. He just hunkered down and he focused. My guess is that he lost between 15 and 20 pounds. I knew that he had a belly when he started and he didn\u2019t have one when he left. And he had much bigger arms, he had much better endurance, his agility had improved tenfold.\n\nMy only concern was that after we parted, being up in Green Bay with a lot of down time, the trick is always how do you keep those good habits intact if a guy like me is not around. Hopefully there is somebody up there that saw the progress and saw the improvement. But I never heard a word from anybody in Green Bay, which I didn\u2019t expect it.\n\nI know for sure that Eddie has really figured out the food thing. He\u2019s continued with that. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be doing that Monday night plyometrics routine, which is brutal. (laughs) It\u2019s a routine that I\u2019ve been doing for 15 years. I\u2019ve had Usher at my house doing it, I\u2019ve had Olympic speed skaters do it and they can\u2019t walk for four or five days. It\u2019s a mother. When he first started, same thing: He couldn\u2019t sit down on the john. At the end, he wasn\u2019t even sore anymore.\n\nQ: How excited are you to see him actually do something now on the field?\n\nA: I\u2019m rooting for him, man, because he\u2019s such a great guy. Here he is, totally different worlds. I\u2019m 30-something years older, you wouldn\u2019t think we have much in common. But we just got along. I think that\u2019s the reason he didn\u2019t bail partway through. And he trusted me, you know? You want to hear something crazy? I\u2019m in the best shape of my life because of training Eddie Lacy. I am. I said to him, \u2018I\u2019m not going to be just your trainer. I\u2019m not going to just stand over you and hound you. I\u2019m going to do everything that you do.\u2019 So if it\u2019s chest and back day, I\u2019m doing it. If it\u2019s plyo day, I\u2019m doing it with you. I was more of a partner in the process than I was a guy just telling him what to do and standing there with a beer belly. We worked out almost seven days a week for two months. We missed some here and there because of travel and stuff.\n\nQ:\u00a0Do you think he ever got close to quitting?\n\nA: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s kind of quiet, keeps those things to himself. I think a few times along the way he felt like \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t know. I would say no. I think he was committed the entire way. I didn\u2019t really see any signs of anything where he was like, \u2018I\u2019m out of here.\u2019 Never.",

The operative word here is mock. We're presenting these from the perspective of the player, as if they were applying for a job with the Jackets. The players themselves aren't involved, so don't contact the team if you disagree with one of their answers! No player will avoid the interview process, not even Rick Nash. Today's interviewee is...\n\n\nQ) Hi James, tell us a little about yourself.\n\nA) I was born in Canton, MI on February 21, 1984. I am a right-handed shooting defenseman, and I've played a bit of all roles over my career. Most recently, I've been a Power Play aficionado as well as an offensive-minded defenseman with a bit of a rough patch to me. I was drafted by the Blackhawks\u00a0156th overall in 2002. I made my debut in 2005 for Chicago, and have also played for the Ducks, Islanders, and Canadiens\u00a0(and am now signed with the\u00a0Blue Jackets)\u00a0in my career.\n\nQ) Tell us about some intangibles you could bring to the Blue Jackets.\n\nA) In terms of intangibles, I would say the fact that I'm willing to mix it up for my teammates, and have played a bit of every role in my career. I can move the puck, boom shots from the point, run the Power Play, and all of that, but I think it's important to note that I'm also not afraid to mix it up. Just ask Jordin Tootoo and Sean Avery. I also have some, though not a ton of, playoff experience.\n\nQ) What areas of your game do you think you can improve on?\n\nA) Well, I need to show some consistency. I had a huge year last year, but until I repeat that performance there will be questions about my \"contract year\". Until I can show a full season with big numbers as well as solid, top-pairing minutes, those questions will follow me in the context of my huge contract.\n\nQ) Can you give us some examples of your hockey accomplishments?\n\nA) Well, an interesting note, I was traded for Samuel Pahlsson once in my career, when I was sent from Chicago to Anahiem. Other than that, I was the CHL Defenceman of the Year in 2003-2004, and I was tied for the fifth-most points by a defenseman last season.\n\nSB Nation Featured Video\nLog In Sign Up\n\nLog In Sign Up\n\nForgot password?\n\nWe'll email you a reset link.\n\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\n\nForgot password?\n\nTry another email?\n\nAlmost done,\n\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that you have read our Privacy Policy.\n\nJoin The Cannon\n\nYou must be a member of The Cannon to participate.\n\nWe have our own Community Guidelines at The Cannon.

        "text":"Checking in with rookie cornerback Asa Jackson\n\nEach week, blogger Matt Vensel fires a few questions at rookie cornerback and kick returner Asa Jackson. The Ravens\u2019 fifth-round pick in April\u2019s draft, Jackson is a Sacramento native who played his college ball at Cal Poly.\n\nMV: You made your NFL debut against the San Diego Chargers on Sunday. How did you find out that you were going to play last weekend and what was your reaction. What did you do when you got the news?\n\nAJ: I kind of had an idea because I came in on Monday and I saw that I was starting on some special teams. That was a good start. Through the week they were telling me to keep playing well on defense, know all of your nickel responsibilities and stuff, because you are probably going to be up this week. And Sunday morning they told me and I was ready to go from there.\n\nMV: Did you have family at the game? I know that\u2019s Southern California, but did anyone make the trip?\n\nAJ: Yeah, that\u2019s Southern California, but I still had a lot of people come down to the game. It was probably, shoot, 20 or so people there, so that was good. It just all worked out great being back in California around my family and being able to get in the game a little bit. It was great.\n\nMV: Was it a hassle dealing with all those tickets? I think some people might not realize you have to pay for them.\n\nAJ: Obviously, paying for them hurt my check this week a little bit, but other than that it was great, just knowing that my family was there to support me and that they would be proud of me no matter what I did.\n\nMV: How do you think you played and what feedback have you gotten from the coaches?\n\nAJ: I think I did alright. Obviously, there are always places to build. I think I could have done a little bit of a better job on some of my reps on punt return, just being more stout and stuff like that. But that will happen in your first NFL games, I guess, just trying to feel out the speed of the game, the physicality of the game and everything. But for the most part, I have gotten good feedback from the coaches. My grades were all good for my special teams stuff so that tells me that I did fine. I\u2019m looking forward to doing the same kind of things this week.\n\nMV: Was there a moment when you were out there and the magnitude of the moment kind of hit you?\n\nAJ: When I made a tackle on kickoff, that was a real big moment for me. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been waiting for, for a long, long time. Yeah, that was my little moment. I\u2019m just thankful for the position that I\u2019m in.\n\nMV: Now that you have gotten a taste of the action, what\u2019s your mindset now?\n\nAJ: I want more. It made me hungrier. We\u2019ll see what happens this week. Hopefully I can do some good things in practice and show them that I should be up again. And just get ready to play another tough, physical game.\n\n\u00a0[To interact with Asa, follow him @_KIDRaven_ on Twitter]\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad",

        "text":"Presser Notes: USC Week\n\nBy Alex Gleitman on September 9, 2009 at 7:00a\nTressel at his weekly press luncheon Tressel hopes all USC has to look forward to is Song Girls\n\nWell the Senator was back at it again this week and this time he not only had to face questions about the game this week, but also questions about the national reputation of the Buckeyes as they head into possibly the biggest statement game played under Tressel at Ohio State.\n\nTressel started out the press conference this week discussing last week's game against Navy. The Vest downplayed the close score of the game, but did expand upon some issues that both the media and fans had on their minds after the game. One of those was putting Joe Bauserman in during the second quarter, and Tressel had this to say about his decision to play the back-up quarterback:\n\nWe were able to get Joe Bauserman in, which I thought was critical to make sure we did that because we feel as if you always have to have two quarterbacks ready to step in front of that huddle.\n\nI agree with Tressel that getting your back up meaningful snaps is important, and the drive did result in a field goal, but there was a chance to put away the game and I think you take that chance when you have it. That is the difference between a coach like Tressel and say Urban Meyer or Pete Carroll, and it could be the difference in winning Saturday's game or not.\n\nTressel then went on to speak about USC coming to town, and highlighted Matt Barkley's performance. Barkley played in his first college game against San Jose State last week going 15-19 for 233 yards and a touchdown in his debut. Tressel seemed impressed with Barkley's performance and thinks he is going to be a good quarterback:\n\nI thought their young quarterback demonstrated a command that might have been beyond his years for a youngster that just came in in the spring and had some spring practice and probably had some increased reps a little bit this preseason because of the injury to the other fellow and took advantage of that, grabbed the job, and stepped up and was very efficient. He's got some great people around him and he recognizes that and distributes the ball very, very well, gets them in the right plays, make the checks and all those things.\n\nTressel obviously said the things you are supposed to say when talking to the media about the opposing quarterback, but I think he brings up a valid point about Barkley participating in spring practice. While Barkley is a freshman, he does have a full slate of practice in the spring, summer, and fall which is very important when you think about how well he has a grasp on the offense and play calls. Imagine if Pryor was able to go through spring practice before last season. As good as he was, the plays Tressel called for LiC were very limited and if he had a better mental hold on the system, we could have seen more results earlier on. Barkley is certainly in for a challenge as practice in no way can simulate the environment he will face Saturday night, but he is as ready as he can be for the biggest game of his life.\n\nAs for USC's other weapons, Tressel discussed the rest of the USC roster, and like the rest of us, knows that it is going to be a big challenge to stop the Trojans this weekend:\n\nAnd their offensive line is a veteran group. They had a couple injuries off and on last year, so they're probably deeper right now than might be normal because they've had some other guys play. And we understand that their outstanding center, O'Dowd, will probably be back, which he's a heck of a football player. And their receiver corps is very, very talented and dangerous and they spread it around whether it's throwing to the backs or throwing to the tight ends or throwing to the wide people. They have a great group of running backs. Joe McKnight is as talented as perhaps they've had, and so our defense has got a tremendous challenge.\n\nOffensively we face a group that conceptually is very, very similar to what they've been. They do have a significant number of new faces, although those faces were on the field a year ago, a lot of them in the special teams and some of them in back-up roles and throughout the course of the year did have some opportunities to play, very talented, great speed, great team defensive speed, excellent knowledge of what they're doing. They're not extremely complicated, but they are extremely good at what they do and you're going to have to earn every yard you can possibly get.\n\nFrom a specialist standpoint, their returners are frightening. They have any one of two or three guys that could bring a punt back on you and the same on the kickoffs and the pressure they can put on you with the speed they have on their field is outstanding. Their specialists that kick and punt are a little bit newer, but did a solid job. I think they had three touchbacks on kickoffs which, when they moved the kickoff back, it became a lot more difficult to get touchbacks and they got three of them there.\n\nIt's a long one, but when talking about USC's team, the one thing that stand out is their depth. I think Tressel recognizes this and knows that even though they lost a ton of players from last year's squad they will be locked and re-loaded for Saturday's game.\n\nThe Vest hit the nail right on the head when talking about USC's offensive line. They are the best in the nation and will be the toughest wall to crack in pursuit of victory. If the OSU defensive line can get pressure on Barkley and get into the backfield to stop the run, the Bucks have a great chance to win the game. If O'Dowd & Co. take care of business on Saturday, we could be in for a long night.\n\nAs for the Trojan defense, I agree with Tressel once again. I think USC is not going to surprise anyone. They run their system and they run it well. They will have big, strong, athletic players who are going to get after you and make you beat them. They dictate how they want you to play and if you do what they want, the game is ultimately over. While some of the big names are gone, some fresh talent comes in and should not be underestimated by the Ohio State offensive unit.\n\nWhen asked about the psychological impact last year's game has on this year's team, Tressel did not shy away from answering the question, but did not exactly say how he plans to use the game for motivation either. Similar questions were asked several times throughout the press luncheon, but Tressel did not give much away in terms of how his team is handling last year's 35-3 defeat:\n\nI'm sure the guys that played in the game last year have a little bit different vantage point than the guys that didn't, and I think motivation at the end of the day ends up how does it motivate you personally. So there will be some guys that say, hey, I could have done this or that better the last time we played, but I hope they said that the week following that game and started working on that. But as a whole, will we sit and pound on the fact that we weren't successful? No.\n\nI take a different viewpoint than The Senator when it comes to this. I think it is important not to put too much pressure on this year's team to have to avenge the embarrassment of last year's loss, but something has to motivate this team to want to bury USC on their home turf. The Buckeyes are 6.5 point under dogs at home. When was the last time you remember the Buckeyes being under dogs at home? Maybe Tress just doesn't want to let the cat out of the box, but something needs to be done to get this team going and not just for the opening kickoff. The effort needs to be there all 60 minutes and the intensity needs to be off the charts for the entire night.\n\nSpeaking of a 60-minute effort, Tressel went on to say:\n\nGosh, I hope they're not thinking about that, because if you're thinking about something that's at the end of those 60 minutes, I'm not sure you're going to play each of those minutes the way that you should. As they watch the film and you ask them what they're thinking, I hope they ask you, what play was called, because that's what's important. What play's called? What defense is called? What's the situation. And not, well, I was thinking if we win this game that will be awesome.\n\nNow that is what I want to hear. Some players admitted that they kind of took the second half off after getting a good jump on Navy, and that is not ok by any means. USC, Florida, Texas, etc. do not take plays off and that is why they are the best teams in the country and the front runners for the MNC. If the Buckeyes want to beat the Trojans they must play all 60 minutes and I put that responsibility on the shoulders of the coaches.\n\nFinally, the Michael Vick eye black. If it wasn't for USC, this would surely be the hot topic of the week. When asked about Pryor's decision to put Vick on his left eye black and if he would institute a policy to have players' eye blacks checked, Tressel said he would not limit a player's individual expression:\n\nIn fact we talked a little bit about that because it's not the first time that we've had letters and emails and so forth about something that someone has personally expressed, whether it's on their eye patches or someone might write something on their shoe, or on the tape on their wrist and those kinds of things.\n\nSo it's a little bit tough in this country to have too much of a policy on personal expression, but it's unfortunate when that distracts from situations that were so extraordinary as the weekend we had. And I guess you'd have to know Terrelle like I know Terrelle. There's probably not a more compassionate human being in the world than Terrelle. We were sitting watching film last night and a text came in from Terrelle and he said, hey, Coach, we've got to pump up T-Wash. He's a little bit down. He dropped a ball or whatever. And that's just the way he thinks all day long.\n\nI remember about 1:00 in the morning after we lost the National Championship to LSU I got a text from Terrelle say... (truncated)",

        "text":"\n\nPEZ Talk: Giro Commentator Anthony McCrossan\nWe're unabashed Giro fans here at PEZ and love everything about the race with organisers RCS having a real history of being innovative. Even we were surprised though to hear an English commentator at the start\/finish line this year. PEZ tracked down the man behind the microphone, Anthony McCrossan to find out more.\n\nThe Tour may be the number one race in the world, but the Giro is gaining ground.\n\nHaving changed the management team and decided that ever more brutal parcours are not the way forward, the 'Pink Race' has been busy embracing new ideas - like asking for the tifosi's opinion on the percorso and having a 'cook off' at the race presentation for the 'Bigs', rather than the 'same old, same old' dull speeches.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest step they've taken is to accept that English is now the international language of cycling - unthinkable in France.\n\nThis year they took the innovative step of having an English 'speaker' at the start and finish of four key stages.\n\nEnglishman Anthony McCrossan was the man chosen for this honour and here at PEZ - as long time Giro lovers - we thought we best get the low down on this ground breaking initiative.\n\nPEZ: Thank you for speaking to us, Anthony - let's go back to the start, how did get into cycling commentary?\n\nIt's funny you should ask me that!\n\nJust the other day I had a phone call from the chap who used to sponsor Velo Club Venta - that was the cycling club where my dad was chairman for a few years and I was a member - he heard me commentating at the Olympics and rang to remind me about my first commentary job.\n\nVC Venta organised a decent criterium in Winchester city centre in the 90's and at the last minute the guy who was supposed to commentate had an; 'I can't do this!' moment.\n\nI stepped in and did the needful. After I realised that I wasn't going to be a pro cyclist, commentating was the direction I moved in.\n\nI moved up from local races to national races and eventually Eurosport. Our old sponsor reminded me that it was a long way from the roof of a double glazing van in Winchester to the 'Pringle' velodrome at the London Olympics!\n\nPEZ: Tell us about your role at the Giro, please.\n\nI'm honoured to be able to say that I was the first ever English language commentator at Milan-Sanremo, the Giro and Lombardia.\n\nIt was prescient because Simon Gerrans won in Sanremo and Ryder Hesjedal won the Giro. They chose four key stages to trial it at the Giro, including the TTT and final stage.\n\nAt the start it's the same job as Daniel Mangeas does at the Tour, introducing the riders at the sign-on. And at the finish I provided commentary for the crowd watching the last 40 K on the big screen.\n\nThe Giro organisers are intent on globalising their race; they know that there will be a lot of English speaking fans there for Cav - who the Italians love - and North American fans for Garmin and Ryder. It was ground breaking stuff.\n\nPEZ: How did you get the gig?\n\nIt's a little bit of a roundabout story. I was 'speaker' at the 2011 Tour of Beijing for the starts and finishes - with a simultaneous Chinese translation.\n\nIt was John Herety who put a word in for me - for which I'm grateful. Anyway, every day this guy was coming up to me and saying; 'good job, well done!'\n\nI didn't know who he was - but it transpires he was Michele Acquarone, the Giro organiser. He said to me at the end of Beijing; 'I love what you're doing, will you come to Milan-Sanremo, the Giro and Lombardia?'\n\nAnthony's 'good job' here in Beijing got him the Giro gig.\n\nPEZ: Tell us about a typical Giro day.\n\nLet's take the last stage time trial into Milan.\n\nWe arrived there late the night before; up early and over breakfast discuss the plans for the day with the Italian commentary team.\n\nThen meet the event producer to discuss the choreography of the day. At the start do interviews, talk about the route, the riders and introduce the jerseys - and the trophy.\n\nThe jersey and trophy presentation are always made by very pretty girls, of course . . .\n\nAnthony's 'colleagues' chatting backstage in Milano this year.\n\nAs the race start approaches 'big up' the stage and then head for the commentary box; which is tiny - and hectic.\n\nAs the finale approaches the deejay works with us on the music - and then it's time for the final presentations.\n\nTo do all that in English is a massive step forward in term of globalising the race.\n\nPEZ: How do you deal with those dreaded sprinters' stages where the suicide break is away all day then gets caught with five K to go?\n\nI did the Tours of Qatar and Oman where nothing much happens - so I know what you mean. And I did the Vuelta for ITV4 . . .\n\nThose are the days where your preparation comes to fruition - I spend a lot of time on the route and the history of the stage.\n\nFor example I'll check out on PEZ and other sites for any interesting information; look at what's on Twitter and talk to the riders the night before, taking notes and looking for interesting stuff to talk about - information that you're not going to get anywhere else.\n\nPEZ: Those are the stages where Dave Duffield used to talk about the menu from the night before.\n\nI did the Dauphine with Dave - I think it was one of his last races - and I have to tell you that he did so much research and had the most comprehensive notes with him, he took the job very seriously.\n\nPEZ: Are there 'Golden Rules' of commentary?\n\nTry and think about what the fans want; and remember that you're not the race, the riders are the race - they're what it's all about.\n\nPEZ: Have you had a look at the 2013 Giro percorso?\n\nVery briefly - but it's an interesting and very beautiful route and I can see why Bradley Wiggins wants to ride it.\n\nI'd love to see him ride it - I know he likes to set himself targets and the Giro would be a good one. And I think that the percorso reflects that the organisation has been listening to the Tifosi about that they want.\n\nPEZ: Do you still work for Cycling TV?\n\nNot so much, they've been quieter this year - but I did do E3 and Dwars Door for them.\n\nPEZ: What does a road race commentator do in the winter?\n\nI'm doing a lot of track commentary, the Glasgow World Cup and the Worlds in Minsk, for example.\n\nAnd the Revolutions at Manchester as well as the Rapha 'Super X' cyclo-cross - I'm pretty busy!\n\nPEZ: Is a commentator allowed to have favourite riders?\n\nI don't think you should have favourites, but you get to be excited.\n\nThere are definitely guys who you have an affinity with, you talk to them, get to know them . . .\n\nAnd when certain riders come to the fore you know it's going to be a key moment in the race - Cav's train leading him out; Gilbert attacking at a crucial moment and in ladies' racing approaching a climb, you just know that Emma Pooley is going to attack.\n\nI think that as a commentator your job is to excite, inform and bring the event to life.\n\nAnthony working at the Giro di Lombardia this year.\n\nPEZ: Mondialisation, your view?\n\nI've worked on Qatar, Oman and Beijing and I totally understand the reasons for it - it's no bad thing, introducing and promoting the sport in new countries and markets.\n\nBut the riders have to be properly looked after and the 'new' money has to find its way back to the teams. As for acceptance and enthusiasm for the race, I can already see the changes in attitude in Beijing.\n\nPEZ: And the UCI points debate?\n\nYou get riders like Matt Brammeier and Dan Lloyd who ride their hearts out for their team but don't have a big points total at the end of the year and therefore struggle for a contract.\n\nI think that when the UCI set the system up, they didn't foresee this situation.\n\nIt has to be looked at quickly otherwise the dynamic of pro racing will chance - domestiques are going to ask; 'why should I ride like this if I'm going to be out of a job at the end of the year?'\n\nPEZ: Lance?\n\nI've been asked that so many times. For all those who love cycling, especially those who held him as a hero, it's just so sad.\n\nIt hurt the sport, let the fans down and to see those results and history erased after the fans worshipped him, again, so sad.\n\nI read Tyler Hamilton's book and thought; 'well maybe this has a skew to it.' But when it really hit me was when I read the riders' affidavits from the Usada report; that's when it became clear what had been going on - I read them all, but David Zabriskie's in particular had an effect upon me.\n\nPeople say to me that it was a great day when Lance was brought down, it wasn't - it was a horrible day.\n\nPEZ: What would you do to tighten up on the drug cheats?\n\nI'd definitely increase the length of the bans - two years isn't enough. I'd make it four years; that would make it much harder for them to get their careers back on track - and for the second offence, I'd make it life.\n\nPEZ: And will we be listening to you at Giro starts in 2013?\nWell, 2012 was a success, so we hope to repeat that.\n\n# Let's hope so; with thanks to Anthony for his time and insights. #\n\n\nPez Comments\n\nRelated Stories",

        "text":"EXCLUSIVE: Judy Murray \u2013 \u201cWe need MORE women in sport\u201d\n\n04 Feb 2015\n\nAs she sets off to lead the Aegon GB Fed Cup Team in Budapest, Hungary, Judy Murray talks exclusively to GLAMOUR.com about sexism in sport, getting more girls playing tennis and being inspired by her sons.\n\nOn getting more people interested in women's sport, Judy told us: \"We need to make sure the level is high enough to retract and retain an audience and that means investing more in getting women up to a higher level at whatever sport it is they choose to play.\"\n\n\"The biggest challenge for me is to get more girls playing tennis and more women coaching it.\"\n\nCaptaining the GB Fed Cup team since December 2011, Judy has chosen British No.1 and rising star Heather Watson, Johanna Konta, Jocelyn Rae and Anna Smith to lead the charge for British success in Hungary. As the Fed Cup gets underway today, we'll have an exclusive daily diary from Heather Watson to keep you up to speed with her progress and give you an insight as to what it's like being at the top of your game in tennis.\n\nRead our full interview with Judy, below.\n\nIn Glamour's new campaign - say no to sexism in sport - we're encouraging women to get involved in and watch more sport. Have you ever experienced sexism in your work?\n\nYeah I suppose so - I've never let it bother me but I think probably any female coaching in any sport will tell you that we're by far outnumbered by male coaches and probably also by male leaders. I think it's one of those things that you really have to work extra hard to create a career pathway for yourself and you probably only get taken really seriously when you've had a good degree of success. I think it's definitely much harder for women to find a career pathway through sport that's why I believe we need more women in leadership roles to create more opportunities for women.\n\nHow important are events like the Fed Cup in raising the profile of female tennis stars to a mass audience?\n\nI think that the Fed Cup is very important because it is a team event and I think that team events are always more appealing to fans than individual events are because it's easier to get behind a team.\n\nWe do have a challenge in that it falls the week after the Australian Open so no media attend it - so it's up to us to try and create our own buzz within the team, our support for each other and a profile using social media ourselves which we've always tried to do certainly in the years that I've been the captain - which has been a lot of fun. I think with social media you can get to a different audience that perhaps you can through written sports media.\n\nHow important is this tournament for the GB Fed Cup players?\n\nTennis of course is an individual sport for the most of the year and I think that if you have a good team spirit it's a really fun way of bringing the girls together. It really can be quite a lonely sport I think in that respect and that's where I think the team events can really help. It brings a group of them together, they support each other during the matches on and off the court and then you hope that transfers onto the tour that they all then go on and support each other when they're at the same tournament. So I think it's a really important way of bringing a different aspect to tennis instead of that individual approach that really takes up most of the season.\n\nJust 7% of sports media coverage is devoted to women. Why do you think this is?\n\nI think there are a number of reasons for that. I think most of the sports journalists are men, I think just 3% are women. I think we see much more male sport on television so I think we need to increase the ability for women to see more women sport. But having said that, we do need to make sure the level is high enough to retract and retain an audience and that means investing more in getting women up to a higher level at whatever sport it is they choose to play.\n\nYou can see with something like the Olympics with the success of the British female athletes like Jess Ennis for example - she's become a household name - a great role model. But out of the Olympics you're not seeing an awful lot of coverage of female sport in the written media or television. Having said that, I also think that one way of attracting a female audience to watch female sport or to learn more about our female sports stars is through women's magazines or through women's pages in the daily papers. I think women are far more likely to be interested in the story behind a successful female athlete than the result of a tennis match or what they scored in their last round of golf or the time they ran 100 meters - I think they're far more interested in the human side of the story.\n\nIt will always be for the most part women who will go and watch women's sports. So if we can create more character through outlets that are read by women - then we will have more chance to do it - that's why I welcome the opportunity to be able to speak to Glamour Magazine and hopefully find a way through those women's channels to raise the profile of more of our female athletes.\n\nTennis is one of the sports where there is slightly more of a level playing field, do you think there's still progress to be made?\n\nTennis is in a fortunate position compared to most sports, it is more of less equal prize money, it has some very big female athlete superstars at the top of the game. Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova are two of the best known female athletes in the world and of course they're tennis players - so that helps a lot as well. I think the big names tend to sell tickets and those tickets get sold for probably quarter final semi-final and final stages but there is still a way to go to get women to go and watch in the earlier rounds. But again that comes about creating personalities and raising levels. But tennis is in a fortunate position in terms of that.\n\nBut when I took on the fed cup I would say that every fed cup captain's meeting I've been at, and they have a number of them at most of the major tournaments, everyone says the same thing that they need to get everyone into tennis. It's really about making tennis more attractive to little girls and to potential female coaches and that's a job really for tennis to get hold of.\n\n[twitter id=\"562319064937558016\"]\n\nDo you think the success of female tennis stars (in terms of profile) could be replicated in other sports?\n\nIf you're going to do that then you need to create personalities and interest in those personalities and obviously tennis is very well covered by media, particularly television. And again, it goes back to that whole thing about people being able to see it. You're able to see it on the television on a very regular basis - it's easier to identify with those female superstars within the tennis world. And you can see coming through someone like heather Watson and Eugenie Bouchard who is only 19 but already huge profile, very very marketable. Li Na, who was the first Chinese player to win a grand slam created an enormous market for tennis in Asia because of her success.\n\nTennis as a sport is more or less shared with men in terms of coverage which has a huge advantage. I don't think you see the same thing in something like golf which is another individual sport. You certainly don't see women's cricket or women's football in the same way. Maybe that's an advantage of individual sport versus a team sport - it is so much about raising the levels to a standard where people want to watch them and can really understand how good they are.\n\nWe obviously have the women's Rugby team winning the World Cup, the England cricketers are fabulous role models as well but it is about getting them out there and showing what they can do and creating the personalities - and maybe you need to create the personality first in order to create the interest and maybe the interest drives the sponsorship and the media coverage.\n\nAnd what's your favourite part of the work you do?\n\nFavourite part of my work is definitely coaching kids and introducing kids to the game. I think going into schools and giving kids the chance to try tennis and I think particularly in Scotland the huge excitement that Andy and Jamie's successes have brought which means when I go into schools they know who I am. They obviously know the boys more but they know that I'm the mum and I can talk to them about how I taught them to play and what Jamie and Andy did at their age and I love going in and doing that. I like coaching and I just happen to be a teacher who does tennis and it doesn't matter to me if I'm working at the top end of the game or complete beginners or 30 kids in a primary school gym - I'm perfectly happy if they're having fun and learning something.\n\nI do enjoy Fed Cup, I like the team element of it, I like the team building, the motivating the players. I really like the tactical side of the game -so analysing our opponents, gaining footage of the matches, analysing them, picking out what I think are the strengths and the weaknesses of the opponent and devising the game plan to take them on. I love doing that and that's always been my favourite part of tennis -is that mental, tactical battle.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAnd the biggest challenge for you?\n\nI think at the moment the biggest challenge for me is to get more girls playing tennis and more women coaching it. I realised very quickly after I took on the Fed Cup job that in order for us to be successful in the world team championships which is what the Fed Cup is - we would need to have a top 5 player, probably a top 20 player as a second and a doubles team, and of course we aren't anywhere near any of those things although Heather Watson's rankings moved up to 38 now.\n\nBut we're quite a long way from being contenders for the Fed Cup. But the only way for us to become a really strong women's tennis nation is to significantly boost the number of the girls coming into the sport which means we need to find a way to make ten...

        "text":"Orlando City v New York Red Bulls\n\nOrlando City v New York Red Bulls\n\nCommentary By: Guy Beale\n\n\nFull Time Summary\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 23:41:58\n\n\nHere are the main points in respect to the referee\u2019s performance:\n\n  \u2022 The Referee did not have a bad game by any stretch tonight, but there were a few areas which he could have improved on which he would do well to sit down and discuss with his coach.\n  \u2022 Positioning wise, for an official who is clearly in a superb condition, it was disappointing to see him getting involved in the play so often and having to readjust his position to keep out of the way.\n  \u2022 As the game progressed, the 24 fouls in the second half (38 in total in the game), completely spoilt the flow of the proceedings.\n\nThere is no doubt that this referee has a lot going for him. His general physique and demeanour, coupled with his fitness all bode well, but someone needs to sit down with him and watch this game through and see how he could improve.\n\nFor a start, he needs to look really hard at his positioning. I have always been an advocate that a referee can never in the wrong position, unless they miss something! Having seen so many assessments in the past which say, \u201cyou need to get deeper\u201d or you \u00a0\u201cneed to get wider\u201d, I have always considered this to be unhelpful advice, as it is so generic and unspecific. That said, the other aspect of the referee\u2019s poor positioning which can be clearly seen, is when they get in the way of the ball or the players. A look back over this game by Ismail and his coach will be able to identify numerous times that this happened. Some basic coaching advice will soon sort that one out and keep him out of the player\u2019s way and \u201cgive them their space to play in\u201d, by reading the game better.\n\nThe other major concern I had with this performance, was the failure of the referee to change his tactics and manage the tempo in the second half. Yes I agree with the 3 cautions in the closing stages, but until there was no sign of the referee trying to \u201cmanage\u201d the players beforehand. He simply reacted to the foul play rather than trying to prevent it. Of course you cannot always stop the players committing offences, but you can at least be seen to be trying. Even though I have been critical of the referee getting too close at times, there were other occasions when he would have done much better to move over to a player who had committed an offence to speak to him and given a sign to everyone else that enough was enough. Because this never happened the foul count just kept going up and up, as the players were in no fear of the consequences of their actions. I could tell at half time that this was in danger of happening.\n\nA lack of variation in whistle tone with monotonous short peeps every time there way a foul just added to the impression that the referee lacked \u201cpresence\u201d in this game. And for someone who possesses such excellent physical presence, then that was disappointing.\n\nOn a positive note to finish with, there is no doubt that the game was well controlled, but I think this referee has more to give and is not quite the full article yet based on this performance.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 23:06:57\n\n\nHere at #YATR, we are all about education and have now launched our new academy, where you can gain access to top ex referees and sports scientists; experience #PL style training; and much more. Registration will remain open forever HERE, so why not join up now, and who knows? \u2013 it might just be the thing which gives you the edge in the promotion race \u2026..\n\nMore Ref Cam this week\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 23:05:36\n\n\nMy final summary will follow very shortly.\n\nI trust you have enjoyed our RefCam coverage this weekend and please keep your views coming on Twitter @youaretheref or email us at \u00a0Info@you-are-the-ref.com\n\nTomorrow night RefCam returns to the EPL for Crystal Palace v Arsenal, where all eyes will be on the Managers again for different reasons.\n\nThe it\u2019s back to the ECL for the mouth-watering 1st leg or the Quarter Final between Atletico Madrid v Leicester City.\n\nA full list of forthcoming RefCam games is always available at: \u00a0http:\/\/you-are-the-ref.com\/ref-cam\/\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 23:04:38\n\nFull Time\n\nOrlando 1 v 0 New York Red Bulls\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 23:02:46\n\nOnce again the referee is seen jumping over the ball in the centre circle, followed by a dreadful caution technique as the Yellow Cardcard is casually raised to wards\u00a0Donny Toia (OC 25) for his holding offence, but there were other players around at the time.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:56:56\n\nMinimum of 3 added minutes at the end of the regulation 90\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:55:35\n\n\nLuis Gil (OC 17) gets the second\u00a0Yellow Card\u00a0of the game for his reckless challenge, but that is precisely what I meant earlier about the reactive style of the referee the longer the game has gone on. Had he got involved a bit more and used his personality to manage the players, some of these constant fouls would not have happened and that type of reckless challenge could have been avoided.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:52:21\n\nHaving mentioned numerous times that the referee has been too close to the players at times, now he seems to be refereeing from a distance as his communication and man management has been non existent this half.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:50:28\n\nThe off side signal was unnecessary then from AR2 Peter Balciuas as the player in the off side position was never going to get involved with the play before the ball crossed the goal-line.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:48:20\n\n\nThe commentators here in England have just commented on the amount of fouls in the game. Glad it is not just me!\n\nThe problem is that the players are happy to continue to just keep fouling as the referee has fails to dish out ant final warnings!\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:45:18\n\n\nAnother clear foul by Carlos Rivas (OC 11) as Orlando break out of defence goes begging as the referee is reluctant to stop the play again, then a clear reckless challenge at the other end does not result in a yellow card. This is starting to feel like it is getting away from Ismail, so he will need to raise his profile now in order to be proactive in the closing stages rather than reactive to ill discipline.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:41:29\n\n\nThat could easily resulted in the second yellow card of the game as the player made no attempt to play the ball but deliberately made contact with his opponent's back.\n\nI definitely get the feeling the intensity of the foul challenges is increasing so the referee will need to think about how is is going to deal with that in the last 20 minutes.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:35:20\n\nGood backwards running again, but I have lost count of how many times this referee has needed to adjust his position at the last minute to keep out of the way!\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:33:59\n\nAnd then we heard a bit of variation for the next free kick!\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:33:05\n\n\nIt is very evident from the referee's short sharp whistle tone which is the same for every free kick, that he is desperate not to draw attention to himself unnecessarily in this game.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:29:26\n\nYellow Card\u00a0Cristian Higuita (OC 7) gets the first caution of the game which could easily have been for either the foul or Dissent after the free kick was awarded. Either way, that came just at the right time for the referee to assert his authority.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:26:47\n\nThat looked like two fouls and Ismail would have done better to have penalised the first one.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:23:18\n\n\nAs the foul count continues to rise as predicted, I would like to see the referee start to begin dishing out a few warnings as to future conduct at least as the players are happy to consistently break up attacking moves.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:21:16\n\nThis game started with the referee getting hit by the ball in the opening minute and I mentioned at the time that that should not happen very often. There we saw the referee ducking out of the way again and his proximity to the players has been evident for the first 52 minutes. This will be a great game to review with his coach to see how he could read the game better.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:18:39\n\nFantastic sprint from end to end by our referee then - excellent fitness displayed\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:17:16\n\nAs the referee is seen running right across in front of the players then on the edge of the penalty area, it seems like there is still some work in progress for Ismail to find the optimum position when play is in this area. The last thing a referee wants is to be hit with a goal-bound strike!\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:14:11\n\n\nA strong careless challenge early in the half reflects how I thought the Red Bulls would come out of the blocks in the second period. The referee needs to be ready for them.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:11:57\n\nRed Bulls get second half underway\n\nHalf Time Summary\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 22:04:18\n\n\nSo far the referee has made a very comfortable start in managing this game. It is fair to say that is has not exactly been a challenging game in the opening half, but the main this is that the referee\u2019s body language and composure have been good and he is communicating well with the players.\n\nPositioning wise there have been a few occasions where Ismail has been sucked in too close to the players, but he seems to have realised it each time and made the necessary adjustments to his patrol path the next time.\n\nWith a foul count of 14 (8 Orlando \/ 6 Red Bulls) in the first half, it will be important for the referee to be alert to who the offenders are, to ensure this does not lead to particular players getting away with a lot of \u201clittle fouls\u201d which generally break up the flow of play.\n\nNo need for the referee to raise his profile yet, but the visitors will no doubt start to up the ante in the second half so all the officials need to be ready to manage the tempo as the heat increases.\n\n\nGB at 2017-04-09 21:56:50\n\n\nFormer Head of professional Referees in England and Director of YATR, Keith Hackett, pr...

        "text":"TIME AND SKATEBOARDING - Super Slow Motion in France\n\nZak Itani's super slow motion video in the streets of\u00a0Aix en Provence, France, showcases skating that is sometimes too fast to appreciate.\n\nTIME AND SKATEBOARDING - Super Slow Motion in France\nTIME AND SKATEBOARDING - Super Slow Motion in France\n\n\nSuper Slow Motion in France\n\nZak Itani\u00a0is a videographer specializing in super slow motion videos. For a recent project, he rounded up Victor Campillo and shot some super slo mo skating in the streets of\u00a0Aix en Provence, France. The footage is pretty rad, and they were able to barge it and get this done in just one day!\nZak was initially interested in shooting skateboarding at\u00a01,000\/frames per second\u00a0to \"showcase the dynamics and aesthetics of skateboarding that we often miss because it's just too fast to appreciate.\" His crew pulled it off. His piece, titled \"When it is Too Fast to See and Too Important Not to,\" proves that the devil is in the details.\u00a0\nHere's a short interview with Zak to get some insight into his inspiration for this project. Zak is currently working on some other projects, but he is always happy to discuss life in the super slow lane.\nFirst off, do you skate?\nI used to skate everyday when I was younger (10-18 years old) with a bunch of friends. In our small hometown, we used to go out and chill, play all sort of games with all these weird concrete shapes, metal bars, which turned out to be our local skatepark. But at the time we didn\u2019t even know it had a proper name. One day a friend just came along with a skateboard. Well, it literally looked like four gritty wheels attached to a rotten plank. Then all those weird constructions made perfect sense. They were made for skateboarding. We would fall so often just trying to ride around, but ultimately we got to manage and progress quite fast. Today I occasionally skate but I never go crazy or too technical\u2014with the job I have I can\u2019t afford injuring myself anymore.\nBut, at the time I would miss a day or two from school, which sounded like a great plan at the time!\nHow long have you been interested in filming?\nI was practically only doing extreme sports (skateboarding and freeskiing) and really got to enjoy the atmosphere surrounding these sports: people\u2019s easygoing and motivating attitudes, lifestyles, friendships. I would watch a ton, I mean literally A TON, of videos as well as skiing or skateboarding videos. I still do. One day it just occurred to me: \u201cface the truth, you'll never be good enough to be pro or something, so why can\u2019t I try to be the guy filming all that crazy stuff? You\u2019ll travel, you\u2019ll have fun, you\u2019ll be allowed to yell when the rider stomps a trick, you\u2019ll party, and you will ultimately have quite a nice job filming all this.\"\u00a0\nSo I went three years to Paris to get a degree in cinematography where I also discovered in myself a true passion for filming techniques, composition, lighting, and all the elements that actually give a specific look to this or that film. A got a few internships\u2014in sport-oriented production houses\u2014here and there and that\u2019s how I started basically. Recently I shot the Red Bull Bowl Rippers in Marseille\u2014not as an intern, though! [laughs]\nWhat was the process like for shooting this video? How long did it take?\nThe process is actually quite short and straightforward. Meaning once you find the right skater and you\u2019ve scouted a few spots here and there, and got that camera in your hands, it all happens on the go. It took us a complete day to shoot the video.\u00a0\n\"He just threw his board on the ground and nailed it a second time. Hats off to Victor as he really is a consistent and truly talented skater.\"\nWere there any funny pedestrian incidents while shooting? I'm assuming that people don't see this kind of performance every day.\nWe shot on December 22nd so people were obsessed with getting their gifts on time. No time to bother us! This time people would stop because of the size of the lens, camera and tripod. It had that \"pro\" look. I was filming with the real cinema gear and people got curious and came asking about the shoot. One guy even came asking if I could film his next conference, you know, like I\u2019m the type of guy who would film a four-hour conference on how bananas in Lebanon grow in greenhouses!\nBasically, they assume there\u2019s some serious business going on and don\u2019t want to interfere with the shoot. Yet, I assume it is a worldwide standard for skateboarders to be kicked out of a spot. The five-0 on that semicircle rail was a first try. The first try one is the close shot. Then a lady came out threatening to call the cops, telling us to get a job rather than disturbing the ones who have one and all that blah-blah shit. But I really needed the wide angle\u2026 So, we agreed to pack and leave, I pretended to take the lens off, my friends spread out and I told Victor, \u201cNow! She\u2019s back in her office. If we shoot right now we\u2019re good!\" He just threw his board on the ground and nailed it a second time. Hats off to Victor as he really is a consistent and truly talented skater.\nHow did the shooting of this video differ from your other projects?\nIt is always very different shooting slow motion for obvious storage reasons. At 1000fps in full HD, the camera records 2-3Gb\/second. It just blows your mind. We had two 256GB memory cards and by the end of the day they were full and we had shot maybe two or three minutes in total! (I only record three seconds or less at a time.)\nThe geniuses who manufacture these cameras are very clever. Since it eats a ton of storage, you trigger the camera's record button only after the action occurs. Basically, the camera is in a loop mode where it is constantly recording and once you trigger, it fetches the last two seconds or so when you programmed it. That is very practical in sports where athletes are likely to fail their trick. If he misses, I don\u2019t trigger. Rinse and repeat.\nI use slow motion cameras quite often and it differs quite a lot from standard shoots since, as a cinematographer, you must train your eye and visualization to see the unseen\u2014to see what is too fast to be seen and chose which moment from that one second sequence is worth capturing. So it is indeed very different than visualizing a regular scene.\n\"It\u2019s relaxing. You could replace your beer with a cup of Earl Grey and watch skateboarding in slow motion!\"\nDid the finished video influence your understanding of skateboarding in any way?\nWell, yes. It\u2019s always a matter of perspectives but now I am more fussy about what happens in the details. Those instants that are invisible to the naked eye.\nSkateboarding is remarkably beautiful. It is a unique body language and super slow motion just proved me right. Don\u2019t get me wrong, regular skateboarding videos are great and I really love watching the riders' performances, I can never wait for the so-called\u00a0\"last trick\"\u00a0in every single video I watch but this time it just felt good appreciating skateboarding from another perspective. It\u2019s relaxing. You could replace your beer with a cup of Earl Grey and watch skateboarding in slow motion!\nWas there a shot that you really wanted to get but were unable to for any reason?\nOverall I am extremely satisfied with what we shot. I wish we could have gone bigger, though. I really would have loved filming that one flip back over 10 stairs or that long crooked hand rail and stretch time to appreciate the full length of that move. Victor Campillo goes big, often. It just wasn\u2019t that type of day or motivation, but it's really nothing to regret.\nYeah, for one day of filming this was amazing. Do you think that there is any untapped use for extreme slo-mo that hasn't been explored yet?\nOh definitely. I have the ideas, all I need is a producer and athletes willing to throw down money and tricks! [laughs]\u00a0Seriously, I think filming a trick or anything in slow motion isn\u2019t very innovative. The concept is paramount. The directors of\u00a0Fully Flared\u00a0[2007] totally understood that. Great skateboarders, great cameras, and several pyrotechnic tricks. The latter being the concept. Best skateboard movie intro ever, in my opinion. In that regard, imagination is the only limit.\nWhat's next for you?\nI just received the screenplay of a movie to be shot in Canada, so I'm reading through this at the moment.\u00a0Snow season began here in Europe so I\u2019m hoping to film some freeskiing soon and a super slow motion music video is in the pipeline.",

        "text":"Checking In With Team President Jon Greenberg\n\nContinuing our summer series of checking in with various members of the Admirals family, today we\u2019re proud to present some Q&A with El Presidente himself, Mr. Jon Greenberg.\n\nRead on to find out some of his highlights from last season, how he has spent his summer vacation, and a bobblehead giveaway that you should expect in November.\n\nAR: \u00a0Going back to the way last season ended\u2026\u2026As someone who is so\u00a0personally and professionally invested in the team on a daily basis, are\u00a0your highs extra high and your lows extra low?\u00a0 I imagine there were\u00a0plenty of both over the last three weeks of the season.\u00a0\n\nJG: \u00a0I learned very early on in my career in sports which will enter year 29\u00a0that you have to be even keel. I certainly enjoy each and every game but\u00a0I know that there will always be a next one. These are long seasons so\u00a0you get yourself on an emotional roller coaster when you work for a\u00a0team. It\u2019s certainly fine when you are a fan and I love the passion of\u00a0our fans who live on the edge of their seats with our games. Even when\u00a0we got knocked out of the playoffs, while disappointing, it just meant\u00a0that it was time to start planning the upcoming season.\u00a0 All of that\u00a0being said, I would love to have the feeling of winning a championship.\u00a0That would certainly be a high worth celebrating!\n\nAR: \u00a0I\u2019m sure everyone will remember the all-hands-on-deck brawl of April\u00a0Fools Day 2012.\u00a0 What are some other events from the season that stand\u00a0out for you as you look back on it, either on or off the ice?\u00a0\n\nJG: The sellout crowd on January 27 was a major highlight for me. It was a\u00a0magical and memorable night and one we hope to duplicate this season.\u00a0Having a coaching change with a successful team was a first for me. When\u00a0Kirk left after 17 games, it certainly caught me off-guard.\n\nBeing able to watch the development of our players over the last month\u00a0of the season when we had to push to get into the playoffs was a lot of\u00a0fun. Finally, just being able watch this business grow with our largest\u00a0average attendance in a decade was a very rewarding.\n\nAR: \u00a0So the season ended.\u00a0 Players went home.\u00a0 Coaches went home.\u00a0 Fans\u00a0shifted to baseball.\u00a0 And you got to go to league meetings.\u00a0 Tell us a\u00a0little bit about your travels so far this summer \u2013 what are the\u00a0different meetings for, and is there anything specific you were able to\u00a0get out of them?\n\nJG: \u00a0The season ended in April and then we had a quarterly AHL Board of\u00a0Governors meeting in May in Chicago. That was just a one-day meeting\u00a0where we discussed some divisional realignment. We were able to get\u00a0Grand Rapids in our division which geographically is great. I\u2019ve always\u00a0enjoyed our games with the Griffins. In mid-June, we had our league\u2019s\u00a0Annual Meeting in Hilton Head, South Carolina. That\u2019s five days of\nmeetings both as a full board and on specific committees. I represent\u00a0the Admirals as a member of the league Sales and Marketing committee. In\u00a0the general session we get to hear a lot of presentations from different\u00a0partners of the league as well as vote on league rules and by-laws. We\u00a0play a lot of golf and get to spend quality time with folks from other\nteams as well as some of the NHL people who are at the meetings.\n\nThen, right after the 4th of July I was off to Rochester, New York for\u00a0four days of AHL Marketing meetings with four members of our staff. We\u00a0are able to share lots of great ideas and learn some new things that are\u00a0going on around the league. There is also a vendor showcase so we can\u00a0see the latest in promotional ideas. I think we get a lot out of that\nmeeting and we have some fun too.\n\nAR: \u00a0\u00a0If a new collective bargaining agreement does not get worked out at the\u00a0NHL level, how would that affect things at the AHL level at the start of\u00a0this season?\n\nJG: \u00a0It doesn\u2019t affect us a ton. We will still be playing our regular\u00a0schedule. The home opener is Friday, October 19. We, along with the\u00a0other 29 teams, may have a few NHL players on our teams as players with\u00a0a certain contract status can still be sent to us to play. This same\u00a0thing happened for the 2004-05 season.\u00a0 So, we might see a few guys that\u00a0we wouldn\u2019t have expected to see but other than that it doesn\u2019t affect\u00a0us other than we will be the best league playing until they come back.\n\nAR: \u00a0What were your first impressions of Coach Evason?\n\nJG: \u00a0I have enjoyed my interactions with Dean. He is a pretty funny guy and\u00a0fun to be around. I can see the intensity that he will bring though. I\u00a0think he\u2019s going to be a fantastic addition to the Admirals family.\n\nAR: \u00a0What kind or presence will the Admirals have at Wisconsin State Fair\u00a0this year?\n\nJG: We will be prominent as always at the State Fair. We will have our\u00a0booth in the Expo Hall where you can come shoot pucks, learn more about\u00a0season tickets, pick up some Admirals gear and talk some hockey with our\u00a0staff. We are also proud to join Saz\u2019s in presenting the Famous Racing\u00a0Pigs again this year. Those shows are a lot of fun and, of course,\u00a0Roscoe will be appearing in the State Fair parade every day.\u00a0 I\u00a0encourage fans to wear the 2012 version of the Get Caught shirt on the\u00a0grounds. If we see you , you can get a free ticket to a 2012-13 game.\n\nAR: \u00a0The scheduler was fairly kind last year, with a very high percentage of\u00a0home games on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\u00a0 As the schedule gets\u00a0worked out this summer, are you hopeful that you\u2019ll get a similar amount\u00a0of games on those prime days?\u00a0 Anything you are at liberty to share\u00a0about the schedule-making process in general?\n\nJG: \u00a0I am hopeful that we can get a schedule that looks a lot like last\u00a0year\u2019s. The schedule plays such a vital role in our success. Last year\u2019s\u00a0schedule allowed us to accomplish a lot from a business standpoint. We\u00a0are one of five teams in the league who shares a building with an NBA\u00a0team so we have to wait for them to get their schedule out. (Editors note: \u00a0Jon responded to these questions shortly before the NBA schedule did come out) \u00a0I know that\u00a0the folks in the league in the AHL office are feverishly working to get\u00a0it done. We are as anxious to get it out as our fans are to see it.\n\nAR: \u00a0You speak to the audience on mic at games several times a year.\u00a0 Do you\u00a0get nervous before they open your mic, or did you get over any public\u00a0speaking fears a long time ago?\n\nJG: \u00a0I took public speaking courses in college and have done so many radio\u00a0and television interviews over the years that it doesn\u2019t really affect\u00a0me at all. The hardest part is always making sure to get all of the\u00a0material in during the allotted time without a script. I hate to leave\u00a0something out that I want to share but I also can\u2019t hold up the game.\n\nAR: \u00a0Are there any new promotions or giveaways or jersey themes or plans or\u00a0concerts for the new season that you can (wink wink) leak some\u00a0information about at this time?\n\nJG: \u00a0We have five guaranteed dates from the league that I can share. Obviously there\u2019s the home opener on Friday, October 19. We\u2019ll also be home on Friday, November 2 and it will be Decision 2012 Night as fans will be able to get either a Barack Obama or Mitt Romney bobblehead thanks to Robert Haack Jewelers. There will be 2,500 of each\u00a0and fans will declare which they want. It will be a highly scientific\u00a0straw poll.\n\nAlso, we\u2019ll be home on three other Fridays, November 30, December 28 and\u00a0January 25. We\u2019re planning big things for all of those so fans should\u00a0get their season tickets and group tickets NOW! I wouldn\u2019t wait another\u00a0second.\n\nAR: \u00a0One last question\u2026.what\u2019s your favorite place to golf in the greater\u00a0Milwaukee metropolitan area?\n\nJG: \u00a0Anywhere that\u2019s free!\u00a0 Just kidding. I enjoy all of the courses here.\u00a0We have so many wonderful golf courses here, most of which are too\u00a0good\/nice for my skill level. Golf has taught me patience and humility.\n\nMany thanks to Greeny for this thoughtful responses and his time.\n\n4 thoughts on \u201cChecking In With Team President Jon Greenberg\u201d\n\n  1. Does anyone else think a good way to boost attendance would be to have the bobblehead giveaways during week nights instead of on Fridays which usually does better numbers wise?\n\n  2. Are casual fans really going to be brought in the doors by the bobbleheads the Ads generally give away?\n\nLeave a Reply",

A win against Jose Mourinho's side is vital.\u00a0\n\nEarlier this week, I caught up with ESPN's Rob Dawson, who follows United closely, to see what he has made of their season so far.\u00a0\n\nUnited are unbeaten in 23 Premier League games after their win over Burnley at the weekend. What have you made of their form this season and how much have they improved under Jose Mourinho?\n\nThey have become much harder to beat, which the long unbeaten run is proof of. They\u2019re also a much more attacking team than last season, although you wouldn\u2019t know it from looking at their goal return.\n\nThey\u2019re balanced and organised - everything you would expect from a Mourinho team. It hasn\u2019t quite happened this season but they don\u2019t look that far away. Scoring goals has been the only issue.\n\nHi Rob, thanks for joining us. Let's start with the big selection issue. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is out, meaning Marcus Rashford is likely to start. He\u2019s a really talented player who gives defenders a difficult time. What\u2019s the best way to cope with him?\n\nThat\u2019s a difficult one and lots of Premier League defenders haven\u2019t had the answer, either. If defenders give him time to run at them, they\u2019re in trouble.\u00a0\n\nHe can run in behind or come short and turn. His movement in the penalty area is phenomenal for someone so young. He's very hard to stop.\n\nMichael Carrick is seen by many as steadying influence in the big games. Do you think he should play?\n\nI think so. It\u2019s a big game away from home and his experience is vital. He\u2019s not a blood and thunder midfielder but he\u2019s good on the ball and calm, and that can spread to the rest of the team in a game that will be played at a high tempo.\n\nWho do you think will partner Eric Bailly at centre-half?\n\nIt will probably be Daley Blind unless Chris Smalling or Phil Jones make miraculous recoveries. That might worry some United fans but he was very good against Sergio Aguero in the derby at the Etihad Stadium at the end of last season.\n\nView original post\n\nHow has Paul Pogba performed in the big games this season and do you think he can go on and fulfil his undoubted potential?\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to properly judge a player that young who has been transferred for such an enormous fee.\n\nHe has had quiet games but he\u2019s been terrific in others. He\u2019s always looked to get on the ball, his passing has been fantastic and he\u2019s been unlucky with the number of times he\u2019s hit the post or bar. It\u2019s been a positive season.\n\nHow big a blow is Rojo\u2019s injury? He\u2019s looked much better this season than last.\n\nBig, because he was playing well. He has looked comfortable next to Bailly and it\u2019s a shame he won\u2019t play again this season. It\u2019s been his best since he joined.\n\nUnited have a few injuries at the moment. How well-equipped is their squad to cope?\n\nThey\u2019ve come at the wrong time. Not only have they had a few injuries, they\u2019ve been playing two games a week for months because of the Europa League.\n\nThe squad is shrinking and the players who have stayed fit have had a massive workload. They\u2019re still managing to pull off big results, though, like the win over Chelsea.\n\nView original post\n\nUnited sit one point below City in the league. This is a huge game now. How do you see the race for the top four ending?\n\nThe derby is a big game and the winner will be in the box seat for a top four finish. United\u2019s run-in is complicated with the Europa League semi-finals but United will fancy their chances of getting into the top four in the form they\u2019re in.\n\nREAD: Fernandinho on Gabriel Jesus\n\nPredicted team?\n\nDe Gea, Valencia, Darmian, Bailly, Blind, Carrick, Herrera, Pogba, Mkhitaryan, Lingard, Rashford.\n\nScore predication?\n\n1-0 United.\n\nRob Dawson is Manchester United correspondent for ESPN.

        "text":"\n\nSaturday, April 01, 2017\n\nWe Did Enough To Win The Game Said Jenkins\n\nManager for the day Steve Jenkins spoke to the local media after Hereford's 3-2 win over Wantage.\n\n\"It was always going to be difficult after you've put the League to bed,\" said Jenkins.\n\n\"We said to the boys it's all about mental attitude today.\n\n\"We didn't have the greatest of starts with the goal we conceeded but we plugged away, fans stayed behind us and pushed us on.\n\n\"We got the win in the end and it was fully deserved.\n\n\"I think they scored two goals from two mistakes.\n\n\"So we must keep our attitude right and finish the season strong.\n\n\"I think we've seen in previous games when teams, and Wantage did, put ten men behind the ball in terms of their game plan, sometimes it's difficult to break down because you have got to move the ball quick because there's not a lot of space out their for the boys.\u00a0\n\n\"Sometimes the two midfielders drop deep to get the ball and then you've got a bit of a gap between them and the two front men. Sometimes they are not easy to break down especially when a team goes 1-0 up as well.\n\n\"It's surprising how much of a lift that gives them to hang to but we kept plugging away.\n\n\"Possibly our quality wasn't there today but did enough to win the game.\"\n\nWantage had to win the game to give them any chance of staying in the league.\n\n\"I thought their attitude was spot on as a young group, they gave absolutely everything.\n\n\"But we kept probing and plugging and we got our deserves at the end. A game we deserved to win but give Wantage credit that they worked their socks off and did their club proud today in terms of their attitude.\n\n\"What do you say about the crowd, they come here in ridiculous numbers. The players are so lucky to play in front of them, the support they give us is absolutely fantastic, I can't say enough about the crowd.\n\n\"We are very fortunate to have crowds like this and they've stuck with us all through the season not just for 90 minutes today, they've been brilliant.\n\n\"We want to win every game whether it's in the cup or the league, we want to win every game.\n\n\"Now we'll just focus towards the next game and the Didcot game has to be replayed so I think it's five League games to go and a Cup final to pay for.\n\n\"Questions will be asked about mentality, can they still lift themselves for the games to come. There's still a lot to play for.\"\n\nFinally a word about Jamie Cuss who needs \u00a310,000 for a knee operation.\n\n\"I feel for Jamie, he's a fantastic lad and Hereford supporter.\n\n\"The luck that he's had this year, it's sad.\u00a0\n\n\"He loves this club to death and I came in today and the fund that he's got it's \u00a33500 in a day. Where do you get that. There's not many clubs that will do that. Absolutely fantastic.\n\n\"Hopefully now he can get to his target, get it done and get fit again and get playing again.\n\n\"He's been at every training session, he comes to games, he loves this club and the fans love him as you can see by their reaction, they're putting their hands in their pockets.\"",
