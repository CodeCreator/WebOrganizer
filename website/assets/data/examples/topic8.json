        "text":"Salon & Spa Policies\n\nMissed Appointment Policy\n\nPlease understand that when you forget or cancel your appointment without giving enough notice, we miss the opportunity to fill that appointment time, and clients on our waiting list miss the opportunity to receive services. Our appointments are confirmed two business days in advance because we know how easy it is to forget an appointment you booked months ago.\u00a0 Since the service is reserved for you personally, a MISSED APPOINTMENT fee will apply.\n\nAs a courtesy, we offer text and\/or email confirmations that are sent out two business days prior to your appointment date. However, if we are unable to reach you please understand that it is your responsibility to remember your appointment dates and times to avoid late arrivals, missed appointments and the missed appointment fee.\n\nWe Require At Least:\n\n  \u2022 24-hours notice for appointment cancellations\n  \u2022 48 hours notice for Spa Package cancellations\n\nGuests who cancel their appointments without proper notice or do not show up for their reserved appointment times are considered a \u201cmissed appointment.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s Policy\n\nInnovations is a family owned business operated by family focused employees. We take the safety and well-being our child guests, as well as, the comfort and relaxation of our adult guests very seriously. In the event you must bring a young child into the salon, please provide proper supervision for them in the form of an additional caretaker. Unfortunately, the salon cannot provide childcare services. Also, young children in carriers\/strollers may not be placed near the service areas or held in the lap.\n\nWe kindly request ONLY those receiving services be present in the service areas. Older children, (12+) capable of sitting quietly and unsupervised, may wait in the provided seating area. While this policy helps ensure that all guests enjoy a relaxing salon experience, it was created with your child\u2019s safety in mind.\n\nOur salon is not child-proof. Sharp instruments, hot styling tools, chemicals and a busy, congested area make for a potentially dangerous environment for young children.\n\nWe greatly appreciate your compliance with our child safety policy.\n\nPrices Policy\n\nWe are constantly expanding our services to bring you the latest and greatest. Although we make every effort to keep our website and spa menu updated, please note that prices and services are subject to change at any time.\n\nOur salon staff works on a \u201cLevel System\u201d which measures experience and years of dedication. Those at higher levels are more often educators and lecturers that have established a high client demand. This encourages stability and allows our employees to grow and prosper based on years of loyalty and dedication to their profession and clients. We provide artists at every level to best suit the needs of our clients.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nPlease notify Guest Services before reserving your appointment if you have high blood pressure, allergies, any other physical ailments or disabilities, or if you are pregnant. If you have any concerns at all, please let us know. If at any time during your services you experience discomfort, please alert your service provider immediately.\n\nPayments & Gratuities\u2019\n\nWe accept cash, MasterCard and Visa. Personal checks are also accepted accompanied with a valid drivers license.\n\nGratuity is not included in the service fees listed on our menu.",

Structured jackets, updated houndstooth, and pops of color made many appearances on the runway.\n\nNicole Miller\n\nMiller\u2019s menswear inspired collection included a lot of updated basics and \u201ccool girl\u201d hats. Graphic prints and the \u201ccolor of the hour\u201d black was also showcased.\n\nCharlotte Ronson\n\nRonson credited her \u201cEnglish heritage\u201d for the inspiration behind the fall 2013 collection. \u00a0It shows, with buttoned up pieces in neutral colors.\n\n\nSuno, known for bold prints and popping colors, also seemed to stick to black in their collection. They still delivered with fun patterns in classic shapes.\n\nStay tuned for days 3&4! Photo to style.com",
