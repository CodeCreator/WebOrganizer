        "text":"Kate Spade NY A\/W 2019\n\nCorduroy. When was the last time anyone saw corduroy\u00a0on a New York runway? I can\u2019t remember exactly when it was and I really don\u2019t want to take the time to look it up, but trust me, it\u2019s been a minute. Yet, not only was it there on the Kate Spade NY runway, it\u2019s what designed Nicola Glass was wearing when she appeared for her end-of-show bow. We\u2019re seeing a significant turn at the brand started with a single handbag. Namely, it\u2019s becoming a ready-to-wear house. From where I\u2019m sitting, I don\u2019t see anyone complaining.\n\nThere are a couple of big differences in this season\u2019s offerings, Glass\u2019 second for the label. First, we see a lot more solid colors in monochromatic looks. Don\u2019t worry, the brand\u2019s trademark animal prints are still there in sufficient abundance, especially in the accessories, but they\u2019ve been pared back in favor of some very bring pieces in crushed velvet and, yep there it is, corduroy. Glass explained that she\u2019s not anti-print but that she felt the collection needed the vibrant cheerful colors right now.\n\nThe one color that is\u00a0not\u00a0in this collection? Black. Not a single piece. There\u2019s a dark forest green on one number, but that\u2019s about as close as it gets. Again, Glass explained that she wants to convey a joyous, upbeat mood. Clearly, she\u2019s trying to put the brand\u2019s challenging past behind it, especially the tragic events of the past year, and move forward.\n\nSilhouettes are a mix of 70s hip and 40s glamour. Reference Yves Saint Laurent with early Christian Dior and then through in just a hint of Marc Jacob\u2019s grunge (not too much, mind you). There are plenty of references to which one might point, but Glass has brought them all together to create a look that meets that old-world glamour we\u2019ve been seeing here and there while maintaining the brand\u2019s everyday appeal. One doesn\u2019t necessarily need a special event to look glam and chic in these pieces.\n\nHere are a few samples from the collection.\n\nAbout those caps, and yes, they are caps. The silk pieces are designed to resemble the turbans many women of means wore during the post-war era when their hair wasn\u2019t looking especially wonderful. The problem with the turbans was they could easily come undone, especially in a stiff breeze. The pieces Glass showed with this collection resemble those folds but are not only permanent in their design, but the caps are also adjustable with a strap in the back, just like a ball cap. Not everyone is sold on this particular accessory. Honestly, when I saw the first one on the opening look I thought it was a modified bandana and that Glass was making a street reference. Opinions are going to vary, so one should probably consider the strength of their personal style before indulging in one.\n\nThis is a strong collection that makes a clear change of direction for the Kate Spade NY brand. Fortunately, it\u2019s a positive move with plenty of excitement behind it. We can look forward to what Glass might do in the future.\n\nMore from charles i. letbetter\n\n\nBritish designers are\u00a0not afraid to tackle serious issues both with their clothes,...\nRead More",

        "text":"Tuesday, September 23, 2008\n\nBeautiful Belles: Twiggy\n\nA series focusing on beautiful women throughout history with important contributions to the arts and entertainment industry and charity -- and a fabulous sense of beauty, inside and out!\n\nWho do we have to thank for long, lush lashes that go on for days and days? Why, Twiggy, of course. The first super-thin supermodel became famous in the 1960s for her big doe eyes, long eyelashes, and -- no surprise here -- her rail-thin frame. (Yes, there were ultra-skinny models before Kate Moss!) Weighing only 90 pounds when she was discovered at the age of 16, Twiggy -- born Lesley Hornby -- became known for the high fashion mod look created by English fashion designer Mary Quant.\n\nTwiggy's popularity and fascination only continued to grow after she was discovered. Her short hair was utterly modern and married the masculine\/feminine side of fashion effortlessly. She was even regarded as one of the faces of \"Swinging London\" -- yes, the era made famous by Austin Powers!\n\nTwiggy's sense of style and beauty is truly iconic. One cannot think of the mod period without associating her along with it. Her big doe eyes were always, always accented with loads of black mascara -- and it's rumored that she would even\ndraw on an extra layer of lashes underneath her eyes for more volume! She kept the rest of her look simple, paring the traditional smoky eye with a nude glossy lip and clear, fresh skin. And let's not forget that hair! Her chopped, boy-meets-girl haircut came at a time when most women revered long tresses. This haircut even inspired me during my college years, when I decided to chop off all my hair!\n\nRecent fans of Twiggy will recognize her from her years as a judge on America's Next Top Model -- a role which, sadly, has now been handed over to Paulina Porizkova. But Twiggy is still out and about, modeling for Marks and Spencer and acting in various movies and television shows. She's appeared The Blues Brothers, Pygmalion (as Eliza Doolittle), The Boy Friend and Edge of Seventeen, just to name a few of her many credits. And all the while, she's looking absolutely fabulous. Her hair is longer and blonder, her makeup is softer, but she still embodies that girl from the 1960s with her beautiful big eyes and dewy skin.\n\nNot only contributing to the fashion, beauty and entertainment worlds, however, Twiggy has donated her time and money to Breakthrough Breast Cancer -- a charity in the UK which supports breast cancer education and research.\n\nTwiggy is truly a fashion and beauty icon. One can only hope she continues to make the arena interesting in years to come!\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\nBlog Widget by LinkWithin",

No zips, no fuss.\n\nI used 1.5m of fabric, which may have been a bit too substantial\u2026\n\n\u2026but it twirls delightfully!\nI love it. I want six of them. I\u2019ve already picked my next fabric (polkadots! or maybe stripes.)\nMeanwhile, all of my flats seem to be \u2013 simultaneously \u2013 having the soles walked out of them, so I bought a new pair in the Wittner sales \u2013 aren\u2019t they adorable?\n\n20 thoughts on \u201cDIY: Oui Oui!\n\n  1. perfect!\n    Love your DIY skirt its simply devine, you look so fun and carefree in these pics\n    the shoes are delightful too xxx\n\n    ps I have bought myself some of that yellow bird seed material and am making my daughter a dress with it as I cant get over how stunning you look in yours xxx\n\n  2. Oh you clever chops! I love that skirt, and I LOVE the fabric! Gosh I could shop in Tessuti's all day and never get sick of looking and touching the fabric there.\n\n  3. Ooooh I love it! Did you use a pattern? Do you think you could do a tutorial next time you make one. I would love something similar.\n\n  4. Well done! Sewing is SO EASY. I make all my own clothes, and there is SO much more enjoyment in wearing your own creation. You know it's not made somewhere bad, you know the love you poured into it and everyone will tell you look great!\n\n  5. It is the best skirt ever to make AND wear \ud83d\ude00\n    It looks lovely on you!\n    That is amazing material, I hope when next we meet we can organise a fabric shopping adventure together!\n\n  6. Please!!! I know that your magnificent necklace is a present of your sister, but would it be possible to know if we can buy him(it) on Internet? If the shop which sells this magnificent necklace has a web site? I live in France and to me, I know a creator who makes this kind of thing but it is frightfully expensive. Thank you very much beforehand about is your answer. Beautiful day to you!\n\n  7. Oh, I keep coming back to read if you've written here that you're going to share all the DIY details.\n\n    Please tell us you will. Please. Pretty please. xx\n\n  8. That's great, Sarah-Jo! It's the cutest fabric, isn't it?\n\n    Me too, Michelle\u2026 I still couldn't find the exact fabric I was looking for though. Something with bold navy & white stripes.\n\n    Hi Katie, I didn't use a pattern, but I'll do a proper DIY post with sew-as-you-go instructions soon, I promise!\n\n    I'm actually tempted, Chantelle\u2026 the Frocks & FrouFrou shopfront, with full skirts & remixed bow cardigans! It *would* help fund my shopping addiction! \ud83d\ude09\n\n    Thanks Wastedfashion \u2013 it's so easy, give it a try!\n\n    Thanks Veronica Darling. It does leave me with a little warm glow of accomplishment\u2026\n\n    Thanks cat-rabbit, and thankyou for the inspiration! I would LOVE to go fabric shopping with you next time you're in town \ud83d\ude42\n\n    I will Anon, promise!\n\n    Aw, thanks for that Katie. You're such a cutie, too! I love your take on the perfect pose!\n\n    Thanks Jen & Bowsnhearts \ud83d\ude42\n\n    Hi Elodie \u2013 I shall ask her! Stay tuned\u2026\n\n    Thanks Darla!\n\n    Stephanie, it's SO EASY. I'm honestly a pretty poor seamstress, but it's hard to get this skirt wrong.

We thought wrong. Today on Instagram, the singer debuted a brand new pastel hair color, a fresh minty green hue on the tips of his extreme fade 'do.\n\nMalik's dabbled with green hair before. Back in 2015, the \"Still Got Time\" crooner treated his short buzz cut to a Joker-level lime green dye job that bordered on punk (well, as close as a rebellious onetime boyband-er can get to punk). This new iteration of green-hued hair reads less severe (as far as Instagram Story evidence goes) with what appears to be an ombre situation into his natural, dark hair color.\n\nCan Malik make green tips a legit grooming move among adults (Jared Leto aside)? We'll have to wait and see. It could be the next wave rebel style hair moves now that the bleached buzz has hit critical mass. But if any man can influence the menswear world's hair trends, it's Zayn Malik.\n\nWatch Now:\n\nRoger Federer Shows You How to Dress for a Snow Day",

        "text":"doing things the victorian way\n\nTag Archives: beauty\n\nI really don\u2019t understand America\u2019s obsession with daily hair washing.\u00a0 I blame it on ad campaigns and ignorance mostly but it makes me a bit angry. It irks me in particular when people assume that, pre-WWI, everyone walked around with greasy, smelly hair (and also that everyone smelled in general, but that\u2019s a different post). Our society is so much healthier now, isn\u2019t it?\n\nLet me dish out some science here \u2013 the scalp and body only produce as much oil as it needs to be healthy. The reason modern folks \u201cneed\u201d to wash their hair everyday is because they wash their hair everyday. Your scalp is just trying to fight back. The more you strip the oil, the more oil your body produces in order to compensate. I only wash my hair once a month, and even then without any soap, and it looks perfectly fine. In fact, it\u2019s incredibly healthy, shiny, and soft because I\u2019m not damaging it on a daily basis. It also grows like a fiend. I know it sounds gross by modern standards but I\u2019ve even had several beauticians ask me what my secret is. Seriously, stop spending so much money on hair care products and just stop washing it so often. You can thank me later.*\n\nAll right, lecture over. On to Victorian Hair Care!\n\nrosemarySoap was incredibly harsh back in olden times and the average person didn\u2019t have the luxury of running water. That meant hauling and heating water to bathe and, as someone who does that, I can attest that it\u2019s a big pain in the ass. So, at the very least by necessity, washing hair didn\u2019t happen often. Instead, there were many remedies and solutions to keep hair looking healthy and I\u2019ve listed just a few of the healthier treatments below.\n\n  \u2022 To Strength Hair and Improve Growth \u2013 A handful of box (buxus sempervirens) leaves added to a pint of boiling water. Infuse until cold, drain liquid and add to it several drops of alcohol to preserve. If box leaves are unavailable, add instead one ounce black tea.\n  \u2022 For Dandruff \u2013 Beat thoroughly one egg yolk, one pint of rain-water, and one ounce of rosemary spirit. Use warm and massage into scalp repeatedly.\n  \u2022 To Wash \u2013 Boil one pint of water with a handful of bran and a dash of white soap, and wash with this solution once every two weeks. Next, rub a beaten egg yolk into scalp and let it remain for several minutes before rinsing with warm water.\n  \u2022 To Maintain Healthy Hair \u2013 Brush 100 strokes twice a day, being sure to maintain a clean hair brush by washing it in warm water and bicarbonate of soda.\n  \u2022 In Between Washes\u00a0 \u2013 Add five sprigs of fresh rosemary to a pot of boiling water. Infuse until cold, drain liquid and add several drops of alcohol to preserve. Rinse hair weekly with mixture, being sure to massage scalp.\n  \u2022 To Prevent Hair Loss \u2013 Steep six ounces of boxwood shavings in twelve ounces of alcohol, at room temperature, for two weeks. Strain and add two ounces of rosemary spirits and two ounces of spirit of nutmeg. Rub into scalp morning and night.\n  \u2022 To Soften Hair \u2013 Beat four egg whites until frothy and apply to the roots of hair, leaving to dry. Wash clean with equal parts rum and rose water.\n  \u2022 For Growth-Inducing Pomade \u2013 Boil half a pound of green southern wood, a pint and a half of sweet oil, and half a pint of port wine. Strain and add two ounces of bear\u2019s grease.\n\nI haven\u2019t tried all of these nor, perhaps, should anyone but I can attest to using both egg and rosemary. Rosemary has natural astringent properties and, in between washes, I regularly use it on my scalp to keep oil at bay and promote growth. I also wash my brush every other day and brush my hair often, as the action helps redistribute the oils throughout the hair \u2013 a natural conditioner.\n\n* Note: It\u2019s really hard to wean yourself off of daily washing, I know. If you\u2019d like to give it a try, I suggest lengthening the time between washing as opposed to going cold turkey. When going cold turkey, your scalp doesn\u2019t realize you\u2019ve stopped abusing it and, thus, it still produces the same amount of oil. Try, instead, to wash every other day for a week, every three days for the next week, every four days, et cetera. Your scalp will rapidly adjust and you won\u2019t have to worry about going to school or work looking like a 50\u2019s greaser.",

Show all posts\n\nWednesday, October 23, 2013\n\nMaybelline Color Elixir by Color Sensational\n\nColor Elixir by Color Sensational\nBy Maybelline\n\nInstantly Intrigued by the Packaging!\n\nI was instantly mesmerized by the beauty of this lipgloss when I first saw it. I was in awe of the packaging and what it promised. To be a lipgloss\/lip treatment that feels cushioning on your lips while it still delivers color and high shine gloss.\n\nHere is the Skinny on the Color Elixir by Color Sensational from Maybelline:\n\nFall under the spell of the elixir effect\nHyper-saturated color, ultra cushiony feel\nThe new hypnotic lip sensation\n\nLook how the bottom looks like a Lipstick!\n\nThis lipgloss feels so good going on, it almost feels like a lip treatment. It feels like a lip gloss and treatment in one. It feels soft and very very cushiony. I think those truly are the best words to describe how it feels going on. The feeling does not go away quick either, it last for quite a while. It also leaves a very glossy looking effect to you lips. I only bought the Color Elixir in one color because I was not sure if it was going to deliver, but I will be definitely going back for more. There are 20 shades to chose from, which means 19 more for me to pick from and 20 for you. I will update this post once I purchase more with swatches of more colors. I decided to play it safe with the first color I picked and get a very pretty beige nude for the Fall. You can never go wrong with a beige nude.\n\nI love these types of applicators.\nThe really help with precision and getting right\nup into the cupids bow of your lip!\n\"60 Nude Illusion\" Swatched\nI had to get the right lighting to show the true color.\n\u00a0It looks a tad orange in the previous pictures!\nI had too many Lights on!\nUpdate: As promised, I went back for more shades and I would like to share them with you!! I definitely think they are worth the money and will be such a treat this winter! The winter and cold weather tends to dry out lips more often and I felt these were an investment in my lips. These Hybrid Lip Gloss\/Lip Balms will be just what I will be grabbing for in those harsh cold months!\n\nStill in Love with the Packaging!\n\nTop to Bottom: \"075 Fuchsia Flourish\" \"050 Caviar Couture\"\n\"100 Petal Plush\" \"045 Amethyst Potion\"\u00a0\nSwatched:\u00a0\u00a0\"075 Fuchsia Flourish\" \"050 Caviar Couture\"\n\"100 Petal Plush\" \"045 Amethyst Potion\"\u00a0\n\nVery Pigmented!! I love how these lip gloss\/balms look the same color in the tube on your lips!!\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nI am so excited to share these with you. I think this lip gloss was a steal for under 8 dollars for all the benefits it includes and how good it feels on your lips. Please let me know if you have tried the Color Elixir and if you like them. I am loving them and I know your lips will love them too.\n\n\nSik Glam",

All I want to do is spend the day in my coziest pjs, wrapped up in a snuggly blanket with a cup of hot cocoa and binge watch Christmas movies on the Hallmark channel. Anybody else feel me? There really is nothing better than being nice and toasty inside when it\u2019s so cold outside! With the holidays looming, the never ending list of errands makes this cozy dream impossible. Leaving my house is inevitable, and while dealing with the frigid temperatures is a given, dressing in comfy cozy pieces makes it more bearable!\n\nWhen shopping for cozy pieces for around the house AND for going out, I always check the Topshop section at Nordstrom. Not only do they carry the cutest knits and outerwear, but they also have a great selection of cute pj sets and loungewear.\n\nMy favorite thing about winter break is spending lazy mornings around the house, before running errands in the afternoon. I love waking up, staying in my pjs and enjoying a cup of coffee while catching up on emails or wrapping presents. Enjoying a lazy morning is not something I get to do during the work week, and I can\u2019t tell you how much I enjoy it! After a lazy morning, I feel refreshed and relaxed and ready to take on the rest of the day! This pj set is one of my current favorites! I love that I can wear it year round and I can\u2019t get enough of the print! Paired with this cozy robe, I am all set for a lazy morning! Both of these pieces would make great Christmas gifts!\n\nWhen heading out to run errands and get lunch with E (another one of my FAVORITE winter break activities\u2026teachers don\u2019t get to go out to lunch during the work week!), I opt for cozy knits that will keep me warm. While I love layering up, I also love a cute sweater dress. It\u2019s one of my favorite ways to feel comfy and cozy all while feeling cute and put together! This sweater dress is SO warm! It\u2019s made of a thicker knit, so it\u2019s perfect for the winter! Styling tip\u2026pair your sweater dresses with over the knee boots in the winter.

        "text":"Hello friends! Today I\u2019m talking about the new Pacifica Crystal Matrix eyeshadow palette that I was lucky enough to win in an instagram giveaway. I\u2019m not usually a huge eyeshadow wearer, but I\u2019ve been getting much more interested in makeup lately so this came at just the right time. Have you seen this palette yet? It has 10 shades,\u00a0all of them with a shimmer finish (so you shine like a crystal, or something like that). I was a little iffy about the shimmer finish of them all, probably due to flashbacks of when I first started wearing makeup in high school and had no idea how to do it, and would usually top off my look with a mountain of glitter. Because, you know, mid 2000s fashion was\u00a0fantastic. (or not)\n\n\nPacifica Crystal Matrix Eye Shadow Palette Review & Look | Odessa Darling\n\nAt first glance, this is a very cute lil palette. It\u2019s small and simple, which is good for someone like me who isn\u2019t looking anything too elaborate. I like the holographic crystals in the background, playing off of the whole unicorn-magic-beauty theme going on lately. There\u2019s a nice variety in the shades: several neutrals, a deep green, a few purples. It As I mentioned, all 10 shades have a shimmer finish, which is more apparent when applied to my eyes than it is in the swatches. The package describes this palette as \u201chighly pigmented mineral eye shadows in a range of your new super wearable favorite colors\u201d. Fair enough! These shades are pretty basic, but not boring.\n\nI love that the shadows are vegan and cruelty free, as well as formulated with pretty clean\u00a0ingredients (depending on how you view mineral makeup). This palette retails for 17.99.\n\n\nPacifica Crystal Matrix Eye shadow Palette Review & Look | Odessa Darling\n\n1. Affected 2. Spaced out 3. Faceted 4. Prism 5. Comet\n\n6.\u00a0Reflector\u00a07. Mars 8. Stolen Stars 9. Meteor 10. Ice\n\n\nWhen the package says highly pigmented, I expected it to be\u2026 well\u2026 highly pigmented. It is not. Even the deep green, dark brown, and plum colors, which appear pretty pigmented on the swatches, start to melt away once you begin to blend.\u00a0I had to layer a\u00a0lot\u00a0to get the following look, as the deep brown I was applying in my crease kept disappearing. My favorite shade is the white in the top left corner, which, when applied, actually is an iridescent pinky shade. It reminds me of a beautiful Mac shadow I used to use in high school for the same purpose (brightening the inner corners). I left this on for a few hours, but my eyes started to get itchy, so I removed it and didn\u2019t get to see how long lasting it is. This is my first time using mineral eyeshadow, so I\u2019m not sure if my eyes didn\u2019t like one of the ingredients, or if I possibly got a little too close on the lower lash line. I don\u2019t have a problem with mineral powder foundation, so it\u2019s hard to say.\n\n\nPacifica Crystal Matrix Eye Shadow Palette Review & Look | Odessa Darling\n\nPacifica Crystal Matrix Eye Shadow Palette Review & Look | Odessa Darling\n\nI ended up liking this more than I anticipated! It\u2019s a nice, natural look that I wouldn\u2019t feel too over-the-top for work. The shimmer finish didn\u2019t end up being too much, and the shades blended together nicely (if not a little too nicely, as the powder starts to disappear). As I mentioned, I did have to apply several layers before the color popped, but that just makes it a little easier to avoid overdoing it.\n\nI used the shade Faceted all over my lid, followed by Mars as a darker shade in the crease. Like I said, it kept melting away, so I ended up using the shade Spaced Out to deepen the outer corners of my eye. I went all over with Prism, then brightened the inner corners and under the brows with Comet.\n\n\nI don\u2019t love this palette, but there are a few shades I like enough to continue to use, namely Comet and Prism. If I hadn\u2019t received this, I probably wouldn\u2019t have purchased it, but I am happy I have it. If you\u2019re looking for a good basic palette for natural every day looks, I think this would probably be a great choice for you. If you\u2019re looking for something that really packs a punch, in pigment and colors, then probably not for you.\n\nPacifica Crystal Matrix Eye Shadow Palette Review & Look | Odessa Darling\n\n(I don\u2019t know what to do with my face in these photos, can you tell?)\n\nThanks for reading!

        "text":"Stay Chic In The Heat\n\nStyle Tips, Women, Seasonal, Clothing\n\nWhen the heat is on the last thing you want is to be feeling hot and bothered. Here are our tips to keep you cool and chic in the Summer sun this season\u2026.\n\nLighten Up\nDarker colours absorb heat so opt for the lighter shades in your palette wherever possible. If you fall into the Deep colour category this can be particularly tricky but you can try adding a little contrast in the form of a pattern or accessory to ensure the lighter shades you\u2019re wearing don\u2019t wash you out.\n\nSeek Shade\nA stylish hat is a surefire way to up the glam factor whilst also shielding you from harmful UV rays. Be sure to choose a style that flatters your face shape with a brim that covers your neck and ears, as well as your face. A breathable material like straw will ensure your head doesn\u2019t get too hot!\n\nSpecs Appeal\nSquinting is never a good look so invest in a good quality pair of sunglasses that flatter your face shape. Remember; opposites are attractive when it comes to face shapes so if you have a rounder face more angular styles will work best, whereas those of you with long or square face shapes are better suited to frames with softer edges.\n\nMaterial Matters\nLinen and cotton are natural, breathable fabrics and therefore great options for keeping cool in warm temperatures. For those of you who love denim, chambray is a great alternative as it looks similar but is much lighter in weight.\n\nLoosen Up\nWhilst it may not always be the most flattering option to wear loose fitting clothes, during the Summer sometimes it is a necessity. If more fluid clothing shapes aren\u2019t typically suited to your body shape then think of ways to customise them a little to show off your figure \u2013 a loosely tied belt around a tunic will nip in your waist for example. For those of you with Oval body shapes now is the time to embrace those gorgeous flowing fabrics (and maybe show a little leg too!)\n\n\nYou may also enjoy",

Using lukewarm or cold water under 30\u00b0C and squeeze gently. Turn inside out when hanging up and do not dry clothes in full sunlight.\n\n    4.The clothes should be at least 3 quarters dry before ironing. Ironing temperature recommended from 100\u00b0C to 180\u00b0C depending on the fabric.\n\n    5.The steam setting should be on high since ironing silk requires a lot of moisture. After the silk is lightly misted with water, it is placed face down on the ironing board and covered with a press cloth.\n\n    6.Avoid washing or bleaching for leather articles. Dry Cleaning is recommended for them.",

It was a lot to happen all before the month of April.
