        "text":"17th October 2019\n\n\nWhat were the Townshend Acts and how did the colonists react?\n\nThe Townshend Acts were actually a series of taxes and laws imposed upon the colonists. The first, the Townshend Revenue Act, placed a tax on glass, paint, oil, lead, paper, and tea. Other bills included in the Townshend Acts contributed to the colonists' angry reaction.\n\nSimilarly, you may ask, what did the colonists do to protest the Townshend Act?\n\nIn 1767, Parliament passed the Townshend Acts, which placed duties on such imported items as glass, tea, lead, paint, and paper. By 1769, after merchants in other cities had joined the boycott, imports of British goods had fallen by 40 percent. Women played an active role in the protests against the Townshend Acts.\n\nWhy were the colonists upset with the Townshend Acts?\n\nParliament passed the Townshend Act in 1767. It placed duties or taxes on glass, lead, paint, paper, and tea imported into the colonies. The Townshend Acts were being disagreed upon it and wanted to protect its duties, so they decided to boycott things from Great Britain.\n\nWhat did the colonists do when the Townshend Acts were passed?\n\nTownshend Acts, (June 15\u2013July 2, 1767), in U.S. colonial history, series of four acts passed by the British Parliament in an attempt to assert what it considered to be its historic right to exert authority over the colonies through suspension of a recalcitrant representative assembly and through strict provisions for\nWrite Your Answer\n\n\n92% people found this answer useful, click to cast your vote.\n\n4.6 \/ 5 based on 5 votes.\n\n\nPress Ctrl + D to add this site to your favorites!",

        "text":"\n\nQ: How long has Sequoia Hospital been around?\n\nA: The idea for the hospital originated in 1938, when a group of nine women lead by Mrs. Henry Beeger made an appeal to the city council of Redwood City for a community hospital to serve the residents of southern San Mateo County.\n\nPlans to establish the hospital were put on hold, however, while the community considered and approved bond issues to fund a city hall and library. The advent of World War II further delayed the hospital plan, but in 1946 voters approved creation of the Sequoia Hospital District. Building commenced in 1949.\n\nOn Oct. 25, 1950, the first patient was admitted to the 106-bed-hospital. In 1960, the hospital was appreciably expanded. Today it has a capacity of 308 beds. It remains at its original location at 170 Alameda de las Pulgas.\n\nQ: Having passed the Cow Palace in Daly City many times, I just wondered how it got that name.\n\nA: The building's official name is \"No. 1A District Agricultural Association, Division of Fairs and Expositions, State of California.\" Built during The Depression, a disgruntled reporter wrote that it seemed a huge expense for a \"palace for cows.\" The name, slightly altered, stuck.\n\nQ: I'm aware that many streets have been named for major figures from the past. What about Whipple Avenue in Redwood City?\n\nA: There was a Stephen D. Whipple who was well-known in horse breeding circles in the 1860s. He owned the Hambletonian and Durham Stock Farm and erected a house and stables at what is today the corner of El Camino and Aragon Boulevard in San Mateo.\n\nHe also was involved in a flour mill in San Francisco, coal mining at Mount Diablo and operated the S.M. Whipple, one of the early steamers on the Bay.\n\nThe name \"Whipple\" came up again in the 1930s, when Laura Thane Whipple, a young real estate agent in Niles, was instrumental in the sale of a large parcel of land between Mountain View and Sunnyvale that eventually became known as Moffett Field.\n\ndidn't open in Redwood City until 195&lt;",

        "text":"Spartan combat training was very rough and dangerous. What percentage of boys survived their training?\n\n  \u2022 3\n    The big myth about boot camp is that it is so difficult - yet the pass rate is and always has been high(usmilitary.about.com\/od\/joiningthemilitary\/l\/blbasicattrit.htm). It is designed to stress its participants, and instill an attitude of can do and \"community*, not actually fail students. I see no reason why this would be any less true in Sparta. Difficulty, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder and all professional military training looks incredibly difficult to the eye of a mere militiaman. \u2013\u00a0Pieter Geerkens Oct 17 '15 at 14:32\n  \u2022 1\n    Only the ones who were not deformed or killed by wolves, mwoo hah hah! \u2013\u00a0Tyler Durden Oct 17 '15 at 14:36\n  \u2022 3\n    -1: OP, you make an assertion \"Spartan combat training was very rough and dangerous.\" Let's say I know nothing about the history of Sparta. Where can I read (please provide your sources) about the fact that Spartan training was worse than anywhere else? \u2013\u00a0CGCampbell Oct 17 '15 at 18:12\n  \u2022 1\n    Pass rate always high? Royal Marines 1st time pass rate is 25%, overall pass rate 40-50% out of 0.01% of the population considered acceptable for basic training. Not what I would call a high pass rate, even allowing for those who just decide it's not for them and leave. Don't know how it equates with Spartan military training, but longest and probably toughest infantry training in the modern world. \u2013\u00a0TheHonRose Oct 17 '15 at 20:36\n  \u2022 1\n    @TheHonRose Yes, but the RM are a special group, with special training, are they not? They would be akin to our Rangers. The attrition rate for special forces are always way above (or below) the norm. What would Spartan forces be equated to, special forces, or regular troops? \u2013\u00a0CGCampbell Oct 17 '15 at 23:53\n\nOur only source both reliable and substantial on Spartan life is Xenophon on the Constitution of the Lacedaimonians. Xenophon reports that the Spartan boys were required to supply themselves with a substantial portion of their own food ration, by foraging and stealing, and\n\n[Lycurgus] made it a point of honour to steal as many cheeses as possible [from the altar of Artemis Orthia], but appointed others to scourge the thieves, meaning to show thereby that by enduring pain for a short time one may win lasting fame and felicity. It is shown herein that where there is need of swiftness, the slothful, as usual, gets little profit and many troubles.\n\nand just prior to this he writes:\n\nBut why, if he believed stealing to be a fine thing, did he have the boy who was caught beaten with many stripes? I reply: Because in all cases men punish a learner for not carrying out properly whatever he is taught to do. So the Spartans chastise those who get caught for stealing badly.\n\nand then further down again we read:\n\nThe penalty for shirking the duties was exclusion from all future honours. He thus caused not only the public authorities, but their relations also to take pains that the lads did not incur the contempt of their fellow citizens by flinching from their tasks.\n\nOnly for cowardice is the ultimate punishment, shunning, called on:\n\nOften when sides are picked for a game of ball [the coward] is the odd man left out: in the chorus he is banished to the ignominious place; in the streets he is bound to make way; when he occupies a seat he must needs give it up, even to a junior; he must support his spinster relatives at home and must explain to them why they are old maids: he must make the best of a fireside without a wife, and yet pay forfeit for that: he may not stroll about with a cheerful countenance, nor behave as though he were a man of unsullied fame, or else he must submit to be beaten by his betters.\n\nSmall wonder, I think, that where such a load of dishonour is laid on the coward, death seems preferable to a life so dishonoured, so ignominious.\n\nSo our evidence from Xenophon is that the intent was to instill cunning, deceit, and resourcefulness, with pain, disgrace, and exclusion from future honours and privileges as the punishment for inadequacy in achievement.\n\nWhile far from definitive, this suggests that, having not been abandoned at birth, the intent was not to weed out by attrition. On the contrary, it became the obligation of one's peers, relatives and superiors to assist each other in attaining one's duties. This philosophy of team-building is very similar to the modern boot camp's goal of turning out squads and platoons which leverage each other's strengths in order to make the whole stronger than the sum of its parts.\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
