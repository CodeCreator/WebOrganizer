        "text":"6 roadblocks to cloud security, and how to move past them\n\nAchieving security in the cloud is far from easy. Learn why that is, and how to fix it.\n\nImage: iStock\/Bob Venezia\n\nIt appears cloud proponents can declare a victory. A recent survey by RightScale Inc., a cloud portfolio management service, suggests more than 90% of businesses are using some form of cloud technology.\n\nImage: RightScale, Inc.\n\nThose pushing cloud services will admit it has been a long, hard fight, with the primary reason for slow adoption being a concern for security. \"If your firm uses cloud services, ultimately, your organization is responsible and liable from a legal perspective for protecting your customers' data \u2014 it's not the cloud provider's liability,\" from the Forrester report Sizing The Cloud Security Market. And being responsible for something controlled by a third party tends not to sit well with upper management.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like achieving security in the cloud comes with more roadblocks than a presidential motorcade on Election Day,\" says Venkat Pothamsetty, vice president of products and customer advocacy for Threat Stack. \"As platforms, devices, and compliance requirements proliferate, picking the right tool(s) for your particular company and industry turn into a complicated ordeal.\"\n\nTo prevent C-Level misgivings from becoming real-world angst, Pothamsetty in his Business 2 Commentary Are Any of These 6 Roadblocks Standing in the Way of Your Cloud Security? discusses six areas that analysts at Threat Stack believe companies new to cloud services or those experiencing issues need to consider. Besides pointing out the roadblocks, Pothamsetty offers suggestions for overcoming them.\n\nThe roadblocks and the fixes\n\n1: After the fact\n\nIn their rush to cloud services, businesses are forgetting to ensure the security of the company's information and infrastructure, as the data is somewhere else now.\n\nThe fix: Pothamsetty suggests a cloud security strategy should be an integral part of any cloud-transition planning or in-house cloud service policies. He adds, \"By starting with a plan, you can focus on investing in a security solution that will monitor and protect your entire infrastructure versus scrambling after the fact to deal with the latest zero-day threats.\"\n\nSEE: Cloud Data Storage Policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\n2: Incomplete picture\n\nPothamsetty feels that most threat detection systems currently used for cloud security are not all encompassing, meaning multiple systems are needed to do the job properly.\n\nThe fix:What's needed is a process\/system integration tool that pulls all the various inputs into a manageable real-time narrative available to and understandable by those responsible for making decisions.\n\n3: Fragmented solutions\n\nNot only is threat detection fragmented, most defense systems are also single-purpose solutions.\n\nThe fix: According to Pothamsetty a management system that integrates every facet of cloud security is required. He adds, \"It's at this level that companies can finally eliminate the complexity, time, and expense it takes to manage the security of their cloud.\"\n\n4: Operational inefficiencies\n\nBesides fragmentation within cloud security systems, Pothamsetty and analysts at Threat Stack bump into problems when trying to meld cloud security systems with DevOps tools and business systems in on-premise, private, and public cloud environments.\n\nThe fix: The solution involves:\n\n  \u2022 simplifying complex deployments;\n  \u2022 automating manual processes; and\n  \u2022 alleviating operational bottlenecks.\n\n\"Whether you're running entirely in the cloud, in the process of migrating, or have a hybrid environment, your security posture needs to be flexible,\" mentions Pothamsetty. \"A solution that integrates across environments and scales with you as you grow is necessary. For without this single pane of glass, you cannot achieve a unified view of your entire infrastructure.\"\n\n5: Complex, expensive solutions\n\nDue to the newness of cloud services, cloud security solutions tend to be generic systems with required tools (audit trails, access controls, intrusion detection) added as afterthoughts. \"Today's fast-moving, high-growth companies recognize this isn't sustainable,\" writes Pothamsetty. \"Cloud security needs to be as streamlined as possible.\"\n\nThe fix: Pothamsetty suggests starting over with a solution built specifically for the cloud, adding that cloud-only solutions are flexible enough to scale capacity to meet the needs of the company.\n\nSEE: Cloud forecast: Trends from RightScale's annual surveys (Tech Pro Research)\n\n6: Lack of content correlation\n\nCompanies must protect business and customer data even though the information traverses several disparate data repositories \u2014 something not always taken into account.\n\nThe fix: \"By automating the data correlation process, your team can elevate their focus from detection to resolution,\" writes Pothamsetty. \"Eliminating these tedious tasks, you'll gain the clearest and most seamless understanding of the threats to your cloud infrastructure.\"\n\nTactical security vs. a strategic-first approach\n\nTo summarize, Pothamsetty feels companies currently opt for what he calls tactical security. \"Throw a product or feature at the security problem and move on,\" he writes. \"But using an ad-hoc approach like this, there is little to no focus on the big picture \u2014 certainly there's no comprehensive strategy.\"\n\nPothamsetty continues, \"Starting at the strategy level allows companies to invest in security platforms that support their entire infrastructure rather than cobbling together single point solutions.\"\n\nAlso see\n\nAbout Michael Kassner\n\nInformation is my field...Writing is my passion...Coupling the two is my mission.\n\nEditor's Picks\n\nFree Newsletters, In your Inbox",

        "text":"Don\u2019t forget these five steps in your Patch Management Policy\n\nPatching is critical. We all know that.\u00a0Business-Tips\nWe hear about it at least once a month\u00a0when Microsoft\nannounces its monthly\u00a0patches on \u201cPatch Tuesday.\u201d\nWe hear about\u00a0it again a couple of more times a\nmonth when Adobe releases yet another\nupdate to Acrobat or Flash.\n\nIf we\u2019re paying attention, we will also hear or read about\nit several more times when our other critical\napps have new patches.\u00a0When it\u2019s time to create your patch management policy,\ndon\u2019t forget these six steps in order to get\u00a0the most for your efforts.\n\n1.Management support is key\nWithout management support, your policy is just a bunch of words\non paper (or bytes in a file.) Your patch management policy needs\nto include support from management to ensure that you are allowed\nto scan systems and deploy patches to them as needed, or that you\ncan assign patching tasks to sysadmins and that they must patch as required.\n\n2. Test, test, test\nYou can just enable automatic updates and hope for the best.\nYou can also drive the wrong way up a one way street.\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend either one though for your long-term prospects.\nYour patch management policy should include testing of all patches\nto ensure they don\u2019t introduce new issues, crash systems, or cause other problems.\nSometimes the patch is worse than the workaround, and testing can help\nyou determine whether a given patch is safe in your environment,\nor if you should focus on mitigations until a more stable update is available.\n\n3.Patch all your operating systems and critical applications\nPatching is something you need to do to maintain operating systems\nand applications. Your patch management policy needs to address both,\nand should be all-encompassing. Servers and workstations, Windows and\nMacs and Linux, Office suites and media players\u2026 all of them need to be\npatched. Make sure your patch management policy leaves nothing behind.\n\n4.Update regularly\nNew vulnerabilities are discovered regularly, and new patches are released\nby vendors both with a regular cadence and when critical vulnerabilities\nbecome public knowledge. Your patch management policy needs to include\nregular updates, both to the systems you are patching, and the solution\nyou use to patch them. Your policy should provide for monthly patching\nto follow Microsoft\u2019s monthly release cadence, but should also allow\ntime to deploy critical out of band patches to operating systems and\napplications when a zero-day exploit is announced. Those aren\u2019t scheduled\u2026\nyou shouldn\u2019t have to wait on a schedule to patch something actively being exploited.\n\nMake sure your patch management policy includes reporting, both to ensure all\nsystems are up to date and that you can report up to management the status of\nyour systems. You want to be able to tell at a glance whether all your systems\nare fully patched or not, and to easily identify which systems need further remediation.\nThe ability to report up to management not only helps to justify costs and efforts,\nbut can work to your advantage when year-end reviews roll around!\n\nOf course, patch management also requires the right application to help\nyou with all of the above. Look for a patch management application that\nsupports your policy, can handle all your critical operating systems\nand applications, makes testing and rollbacks easy, and can provide all the reporting you need.\n\nPeter Walsh on behalf of GFI Software.\n\nFind out more on how your business can benefit from a good patch management policy.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

        "text":"Banner Dianegilleland Column\n\n(Image by clevercupcakes, via Flickr Creative Commons)\nBy Diane Gilleland\nTwitter is such a great tool for meeting people, connecting with them, and promoting stuff. But it can be very time-consuming to use, and it\u2019s also pretty easy to misuse.\nLuckily, there are so many helpful extras to make your tweeting easier and more effective. Here are some of my favorites.\nDiane Twittertools 2\nCustomize your profile page with Themeleon\nIf you\u2019re using Twitter to promote a crafty business, then it really helps if your Twitter profile page ties in visually with the colors and images of your business brand. Themeleon is a great tool for Twitter-page customization. Once you log into Themeleon through your Twitter account, it lets you upload a new background image, and then helps you choose good background and text colors to go with it. If you don\u2019t have a custom background for your Twitter page yet, you can choose from over a thousand beautiful ones in Themeleon.\n\nDiane Twittertools 3\nOrganize your reading with Twitter Lists\nYour Twitter homepage also offers a great and under-used feature: Lists. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 the more people you follow, the harder it is to read all their tweets. Before long, your Twitter stream becomes simply unmanageable.\nWell, you can organize the people you follow into Lists according to theme, and this really helps you read tweets more efficiently. For example, I have a list of crafty people I follow, and another list of publishing-related people, and another of business-related people. That way, when I have a few minutes to catch up on tweets, I can choose a list and read tweets about a specific subject. You can make your Lists public (so others can see them) or private (so only you can).\nDiane Twittertools 4\nPre-schedule some of your tweets with HootSuite\nPerhaps the biggest problem with Twitter is that, if you want to stay present with your followers all the time, you have to be on Twitter all the time. But most of us have other obligations (not to mention, craft projects to do), so you might want to try scheduling some of your tweets ahead.\nThere are a number of tools that do this, and my favorite is HootSuite. This tool does a whole lot more than schedule tweets \u2013 it will also send updates to Facebook, and shorten the URLs you tweet. You can even import your Twitter Lists into HootSuite and display them in organized columns.\nBut pre-scheduling some tweets is very helpful for time management. If you usually share some good links from around the web, why not schedule them to post throughout the day? That way, you can visit Twitter less often and tackle your To-Do list. And why not schedule some tweets for the hours when you\u2019re asleep? There are people on Twitter 24 hours a day \u2013 why not reach them?\nDiane Twittertools 5\nSpread the word with Pay With A Tweet\nIf you have something to market on Twitter, you can really turn off your followers by tweeting about it over and over again. So instead, you might try Pay With A Tweet. With this service, you create some kind of small freebie \u2013 a PDF tutorial, maybe, or a free pattern.\nNow, to get this freebie, all anyone has to do is tweet about another product or project you\u2019re marketing. This is a nice service because you\u2019re giving people something in exchange for helping you spread the word, and it also lets you reach way outside your existing followers. (Would you like to see this in action? Check out the free tutorial a buddy and I are giving away to people who tweet about our ebook.)\nDiane Twittertools 6\nClean up your following with TwitCleaner\nPeople are popping on and off Twitter all the time. Within the group of folks you\u2019ve followed, there\u2019s very likely a healthy percentage who\u2019ve given up on tweeting altogether. There are probably also quite a few who do nothing but tweet links to their online stores every day.\nTwitCleaner will run you a handy report that shows you which of the people you\u2019re following haven\u2019t tweeted in over a month. It\u2019ll show you which people are tweeting the same links over and over. It will also show you those who don\u2019t interact with people much, and the ones who aren\u2019t following you back. You can use this information to unfollow the people who aren\u2019t bringing value to your Twitter experience.\nDiane Twittertools 7\nLearn more about how you tweet with Twitalyzer\nWhen we\u2019re focused on our next tweet, it\u2019s easy to lose the bigger picture of the story our tweets are telling as a whole. Twitalyzer will analyze your Twitter history and run you a custom report \u2013 with what can only be described as an insane amount of detail.\nYour Twitalyzer report will tell you, among other things, what kind of influence you have on Twitter. It also tells you who the influencers are in your current network, what days and hours you tweet most, how often you\u2019re retweeted, and what subjects you commonly tweet about. You can compare your Twitter influence to that of any other user. Heck, you can even hook Twitalyzer up with your blog\u2019s Google Analytics, and analyze the clicks that come to you through Twitter.\nSeriously, you can spend hours playing with all this data. And you can clearly see how you can improve your tweeting.\nAbout the Author:\nDiane Gilleland produces, a blog that geeks out on crafting and also helps crafters use the web more effectively to promote their businesses.\n\n  \u2022 unsofmarcelo\n\n    I am sure you will love online shopping online shopping\n\nRelated Supplies at Maker Shed",

Got an idea for our list? Leave a comment and we\u2019ll take a look.\n\nAPP OF THE WEEK: Skyscanner \u2013 All Flights\n\nStay on top of your finances with Expense IQ.\n\nWhat is Expense IQ?\n\nThis app, from developer Handy Apps, tries to make managing your expenses and personal finance easy. With a clean layout and several useful features, Expense IQ will have you planning budgets and staying on top of your spending in no time.\n\nWhat\u2019s good?\n\nFirstly, Handy Apps has used Material Design guidelines for the layout, so everything feels familiar and cleanly implemented. The main menu slides in from the left and is where you\u2019ll access the various sections. Each section is clearly marked, which is helpful in an app that could easily become confusing, what with all the financial information and various features.\n\nSo what about those features? Expense IQ\u2019s main components are the expense manager and budget manager. The former allows you to quickly enter any expenses you incur throughout your day by tapping the small plus symbol in the bottom right of the Overview screen \u2013 the default screen that appears when the app opens.\n\nAll you have to do is set up your account information, which involves simply telling the app how much you have in the bank and how much you have in cash. Any expenses you enter are then taken off the total amount.\n\nExpense IQ\n\nThe Smart Overview page makes it easy to see how much you have left in total, when you spent money, how much you spent, as well as any bills which are due. It\u2019s also populated with helpful graphs and visualisations of your spending.\n\nFor those that want to stick to a financial plan, the app allows you to set a budget for specific categories. Say you want to only spend \u00a3200 on entertainment, you can set that amount as a budget for the entertainment category, then whenever you enter an amount for entertainment expense, as long as you categorise it, the money will be taken off your budget for entertainment as well as the total in your account.\n\nIt\u2019s all very intuitive and takes minutes to get the hang of. Other features include bill reminders, which allows you to easily set alerts for when bills are due, the ability to backup and restore offline, a home screen widget, the ability to store photos of your bills and receipts and attach them to specific expenses, and much more.\n\nWhat\u2019s bad?\n\nWhile the interface is, overall, easy to get to grips with, I found it took a few minutes to figure out adding expenses and setting up accounts. It\u2019s not a major drawback, as there\u2019s more going on here than with other apps that concern themselves with less complicated tasks than managing your entire finances. But you might find it takes a little while to get the hang of things at first.\n\nAnd, like most apps these days, Expense IQ also has a Premium version which will cost you. Going Premium costs \u00a31.41 per month or you can pay a strangely specific price of \u00a341.06 for a lifetime subscription. Signing up for Premium removes ads, gets you unlimited accounts and budgets, multi-currency transfers, cloud syncing, and a host of extra features. While the app is certainly worth a look, only those serious enough about keeping track of their expenditure will want to pay the monthly charge.\n\n\nA well-presented and comprehensive app, Expense IQ is a no brainer for those interested in a mobile money management solution.\n\nScore: 9 | Price: Free (Premium version \u00a31.41 per month\/$41.06 lifetime) | In-app purchases? No | Download Expense IQ\n\nHit the \u2018Next\u2019 arrow to see more of the best Android apps.\n\nArticle Source\n\nShare and Enjoy\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"10 Firefox Add-ons for Security Researchers and Penetration Testers\n\nBuilt Bar: 12% Off* w\/ Code: SAVE12\nUp To 75% Off Brand Name Cosmetics and More!\nUP TO 69% OFF Health Care Items\n\nDid you know that you can turn Mozilla FireFox into a useful penetration testing tools with just a few add-ons, in this article we will present you with 10 useful add-ons\n\nFoxyProxy Standard\n\nFoxyProxy is a Firefox extension which automatically switches an internet connection across one or more proxy servers based on URL patterns. Put simply, FoxyProxy automates the manual process of editing Firefox\u2019s Connection Settings dialog. Proxy server switching occurs based on the loading URL and the switching rules you define.\n\n  \u2022 Switch proxies with URL pattern matching\n  \u2022 Custom colors make it easy to see which proxy is in use\n  \u2022 Advanced logging shows you which proxies were used and when\n  \u2022 Automatically synchronize all of your proxy settings with your other Firefox instances when you use Firefox Sync. Import\/Export settings to files when not using Firefox Sync\n\n\nLive HTTP Headers\n\nA really useful extension for penetration testing, you can\u00a0display live headers of each http request and response. You are also able to save header information by clicking on a button\n\n\n\nThis toolbar will help you in testing sql injections, XSS holes and site security. It is NOT a tool for executing standard exploits and it will NOT teach you how to hack a site. Its main purpose is to help a developer do security audits on his code. If you know what your doing, this toolbar will help you do it faster. If you want to learn to find security holes, you can also use this toolbar, but you will probably also need a book, a lot of Google and a brain \ud83d\ude42\n\n# The advantages are:\n\u2013 Even the most complicated urls will be readable\n\u2013 The focus will stay on the textarea, so after executing the url (Ctrl+Enter) you can just go on typing \/ testing\n\u2013 The url in textarea is not affected by redirects.\n\u2013 I tend to use it as a notepad \ud83d\ude42\n\u2013 Useful tools like on the fly uu\/url decoding etc.\n\u2013 All functions work on the currently selected text.\n\u2013 MD5\/SHA1\/SHA256 hashing\n\u2013 MySQL\/MS SQL Server\/Oracle shortcuts\n\u2013 XSS useful functions\n\u2013 And lots more \ud83d\ude09 Go test it!\n\n\nSQL Inject Me\n\nSQL Inject Me is the Exploit-Me tool used to test for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.\n\nThe tool works by submitting your HTML forms and substituting the form value with strings that are representative of an SQL Injection attack.\n\nThe tool works by sending database escape strings through the form fields. It then looks for database error messages that are output into the rendered HTML of the page.\n\nThe tool does not attempting to compromise the security of the given system. It looks for possible entry points for an attack against the system. There is no port scanning, packet sniffing, password hacking or firewall attacks done by the tool.\n\nYou can think of the work done by the tool as the same as the QA testers for the site manually entering all of these strings into the form fields.\n\n\nAccess Me\n\nAccess vulnerabilities in an application can allow an attacker to access resources without being authenticated. Access-Me is a Firefox extension used to test for Access vulnerabilities.\n\nThe current version of Access-Me is an Exploit-Me tool used to test some access vulnerabilities related to web applications. The tool works by sending several versions of the last page request. A request with the session removed will be sent. A request using the HTTP HEAD verb and a request using a made up SECCOM verb will be sent. A combination of session and HEAD\/SECCOM will also be sent.\n\n\nPacket Storm search plugin\n\nThis plugin lets you search on Packet Storm \u2013 www.packetstormsecurity.org \u2013 database. Packet Storm offers an abundant resource of up-to-date and historical security tools, exploits, and advisories.\n\n\nOSVDB\u00a0search plugin\n\nThis plugin lets you search on the open source vulnerability database. It searches not only on titles but all text\n\n\n\nPassiveRecon provides information security professionals with the ability to perform \u201cpacketless\u201d discovery of target resources utilizing publicly available information.\n\nSimply visit the target entity\u2019s website (using Tor), right mouse-click and navigate to the PassiveRecon menu, or use the status bar menu. From there you can open individual public domain websites or click Show All to view all of the sites at once.\n\n\nSnort IDS Rule Search\n\nSearch for Snort IDS Rules.\u00a0 This search add-ons allows you to search for Snort IDS rules on the snort.org website.\n\n\n\n\nCryptoFox is an encryption\/decryption tool for Mozilla Firefox, with dictionary attack support for cracking MD5 passwords. The tool supports many\u00a0encryption algorithms already.\n\n\nLeave your vote",

        "text":"iPhone Application Overview And Demo Videos\n\nNext Story\n\nSynthaSite Launches New Interface To Simplify WYSIWYG Site\u00a0Creation\n\nIt\u2019s not official quite yet, but the iPhone App Store is live and you can download version 2.0 of the iPhone software \u2013 which is all you need to run the 552 applications currently available.\n\nWe\u2019ve been gathering videos and overviews of many of the applications and have held them until now. We received demo vidoes for dozens of applications, ranging from basic games to complex GPS-enabled social networking applications. Below are some of our favorites.\n\nAmong the apps that we didn\u2019t include below (primarily because of their simplicity) are Recorder (a voice recorder), Movies (movie showtimes), and iMaze (a basic maze game).\n\nSocial Networking On The iPhone:\n\nThe iPhone, with cult-like users and location aware technology, is the perfect social networking device. Earlier this year we speculated that someone would emerge with a killer social networking app for the iPhone. It turns out that there are lots of contenders.\n\n\nLoopt \u2013 We\u2019ve been tracking Loopt\u2019s efforts around their iPhone application for months now. In April we posted early screen shots of the app without saying who had built it. Think of Loopt as a simple social network to find local businesses, message friends and send status updates with where you are (using the iPhones location technology). And a key difference with Loopt and many of the other networks below: you can meet new people who are nearby, if they choose to share that information. If everyone used this, you could see who\u2019s single in a bar before you approach them (and flirt with them by phone first), and know the first name and job of everyone at that cocktail hour at the tech conference. We\u2019re big fans of Loopt, and will have more news on them later today. For now, download the free application here.\n\n\n\nLimbo \u2013 Limbo is another geo-aware social network that behaves like a mashup of Twitter, Loopt, and Whrrl. One of the app\u2019s most compelling features is its grid-like diagram that visually groups your friends according to what they\u2019re doing (for example, all of your friends that are Out Drinking will be lumped together, even if they aren\u2019t necessarily drinking in the same place). The app accomplishes this feat by forcing users to select from a predefined hierarchal list of activities (while this might sound restrictive, the list is pretty comprehensive). This categorization allows users to see what they\u2019re friends are up to without having to sift through each of their messages.\n\nOn the geo-positioning front, Limbo allows users to interact users who are within a close radius (about a quarter mile), in a manner that is similar to Loopt. You can download the app here for free.\n\n\n\nMySpace \u2013 The MySpace iPhone app is everything you\u2019d expect from a multi-billion dollar company: the app integrates seamlessly with the massive social network, allowing users to add friends, exchange messages, upload photos, and do just about anything else they could do from their computers at home. They aren\u2019t yet integrating with the location features, but expect that in the near future. If you are a MySpace user, you\u2019ll be using this constantly. You can download the app here for free.\n\n\nShoZu \u2013 The ShoZu iPhone app allows users to interact with a number of social websites, including YouTube, Facebook, Flickr, and a number of others. Users can upload photos to these services, comment on other users\u2019 profiles, and send status updates, depending on the site involved. You can download the app here for free.\n\n\nUtilities and Reference:\n\nThe introduction of the iPhone app store has effectively made the iPhone the ultimate utility belt. We\u2019re seeing no shortage of apps that aim to make life easier for users, and while many of them are a little too simplistic (how many tip calculators do we really need?), others will be godsends for some people, serving up the latest sports news, on-demand drink recipes, and restaurant recommendations.\n\nSave Benjis\n\nSave Benjis \u2013 Save Benjis is a shopping tool that will look up a product\u2019s price according to its model number. Using model numbers instead of product names helps take the guesswork out of pricing comparisons (for example, it would be much easier to compare two computers with their model numbers versus a name like \u201cMacBook Pro\u201d). The app integrates the Safari web browser, so users can browse and purchase goods on a website from their phone if they find a better price. You can download the app here for free.\n\n\nPocket Express\n\nPocket Express \u2013 Pocket Express is a news and information service that is available for a number of smart phones. The app allows users to browse through news articles written by the Associated Press on topics that include politics, science, and world news. Users can also browse through sports scores, weather reports, and movie information. You can download the app here for free.\n\n\n\nUrbanspoon \u2013 Urbanspoon brings a fun (and gimmicky) solution to choosing a restaurant for dinner. After using the phone\u2019s GPS to detect restaurants in the area, Urbanspoon presents you with a slot machine-like listing of cuisine types and price. To activate the slot machine, you give the phone a hard shake (the accelerometers inside the phone will measure the movement). The dials will spin around a few times, and you\u2019ll be presented with a suggested restaurant (you can shake again if you\u2019re not satisfied). You can download the app here for free.\n\n\n\nCocktails \u2013 Cocktails is a well designed reference for \u201cpotent potables\u201d that will put traditional bar-tending guides to shame. Users can browse through a large index of drinks, search by ingredient or drink name, and label drinks as favorites for future reference. The app also includes information about the type of serving glass to use, as well as the date that each recipe was created (there are often multiple recipes available for each drink). You can download the app here for $9.99.\n\n\n\nForeFlight \u2013 ForeFlight is an iPhone app that is aimed towards pilots (both recreational and professional) rather than your average consumer. The app allows users to find nearby airports, maps, diagrams of airports, and lookup of plane information by tail number. The app also includes the A\/FD, the Airport and Facilities Directory, which includes location data like field and approach information and location data on hotels. You can download the app here for a whopping $69.99 (the highest price in the store).\n\n\nAudio and Video\n\nApp providers will make use of the 3G iPhone\u2019s speedy network with streaming audio and video apps that will allow users to consume a near-limitless amount of content without having to sync up with their computers. Unfortunately, the iPhone is still unable to record video, so all media uploading will be limited to photos for now.\n\nKyte Mobile Producer\n\nKyte Mobile Producer \u2013 Kyte\u2019s Mobile Producer is a mobile image uploading app. Users can upload the images they take from their iPhones directy to Kyte Channels that they\u2019ve embedded in their blogs or onto their Facebook profile through Kyte\u2019s facebook app. Users can also compile their images into slideshows, complete with captions and polls, which can also be played through the their Kyte Channels online. You can download the app here for free.\n\n\n\nmdialog \u2013 mdialog\u2019s iPhone app allows users to browse through content that have been uploaded to the video site. The app is reminiscent of YouTube, allowing users to share and bookmark their favorite channels, leave comments, and browse through a \u201cWhat\u2019s New Section\u201d. Users can also attach polls to their videos. You can download the app here for free.\n\n\nPandora Radio\n\nPandora Radio, our flat out favorite application so far, is an audio app that streams music to the iPhone over Wi-Fi, 3G, or Edge. Pandora is a popular music service that creates a \u201cMusic Genome\u201d to analyze music a user likes and then recommend new artists. Users can enter the name of an artist or song they like, and Pandora will generate a streaming playlist, even if they haven\u2019t created a profile. You can try out the app here for free.\n\n\nUpdate: Here is a late addition:\n\n\nJott \u2013 Self-dubbed \u201cthe notepad you\u2019ve always dreamed of,\u201d the Jott iPhone app records your voice and turns it into text. You can add items to specific lists and cross them off once you don\u2019t need to worry about them any longer. Additionally, all of your notes are backed up online. You can try out the app here for free.\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus",

        "text":"How to Rank the Windows Hosting\n\nTo choose the really reliable Windows hosting, we follow the below guidelines.\n\n#Operation System\n\nThe web hosting based on Windows server 2012 edition is ranked higher than the previous editions. Windows server 2012 has better performance, better stability, less consumption of system resources and high security. And it supports the best web server IIS 8.0 in Windows platform so far, which integrates with the ASP.NET pipeline much better than IIS 8.5\/7.0\n\n\n#Database System\n\nASP.NET applications work better with MSSQL than MySQL or PostgreSQL database. And the Windows web hosting supported MSSQL 2008 R2 gets a higher grade than MSSQL2005 and MSSQL2000. Feature and benefits in MSSQL2008 are better than the previous version of MSSQL, such as encrypt to enhance security, data compression to save disk space, parallel computing to accelerate speed, less consumption of system resource, and so on.\n\n#DotNET Framework\n\nThe Windows hosting with support to multiple .NET framework versions especially .NET Framework V4 has a higher score in the ranking. The more versions supported the less compatible problems you may encounter, which also provides you more scalability to upgrade the websites later.\n\n#Control Panel\n\nPlesk is ranked as the No.1 control panel for Windows web hosting, and DotNETPanel, H-Sphere and other types have its advantage and disadvantage. We graded these types of control panels with different scores.\n\n\nReliability is the factor must be considered. It is evaluated by different criteria, we list these indicators below.\n\n  \u2022 Uptime\n  \u2022 Pre-install anti-virus software\n  \u2022 Pre-install firewall\n  \u2022 Network\n  \u2022 Stable Datacenter\n\nThe best Windows web hosting listed above are ranked on these criteria, and all the 3 best windows web hosting truly meet the highest standards, which can powerful enough to run your website.\n\nPros and Cons of Windows Web Hosting\n\nIn fact, the Windows hosting solution is not as popular as the Linux hosting service. To give you a better understanding about this hosting type, we have listed some strong points and weak points of Windows web hosting.\n\nThe Strong Points\n\nIf your web host is a reliable and quality hosting provider, this hosting type can even achieve a more stable running than the normal Linux hosting solution.\nIt is surely multilingual that supports multiple scripting languages we have covered nowadays.\nThis hosting type is surely easy-to-use due to the immense popularity of Microsoft technologies. With it, there is no need to for you run the command line.\nIf you do not have enough experiences and knowledge of hosting, this type of hosting solution is arguably easier for you for the management tasks.\n\nThe Weak Points\n\nWindows hosting is surely expensive. After all, the system of Windows is not free to use, but requires you to pay for the license fee. In addition, Windows can only be got from the official site or a few appointed agents, so there are almost no chances for you to get some lower charges or the attractive promotional campaign.\nIf you want to install some PHP based plugins, extensions and modules, the Windows hosting may fail to work well due to the compatibility issue.\nGenerally, PHP cannot work effectively with IIS as compared with Apache. For webmasters who are running a PHP based application, the 500 error might occur constantly.\nYour web hosts may give you little flexibility for customizing and configuring your web servers.\nIf you want to use WordPress to set up and control your website, the Windows hosting service may fail to ensure you a good experience.",

        "text":"Traveling for the holidays almost always means that if you\u2019re the tech-savvy, computer literate one in the family, someone will ask you to look at their laptop, phone, or desktop. Head them off at the pass with this list of tips the next time you\u2019re home.\n\n10. Run OS Updates (as Soon As You Arrive)\n\nUnless you think you\u2019ll have plenty of time to just hang around and relax while you\u2019re there, with the computer off in the background or another room downloading updates and patches, maybe start Windows Update or fire up the Mac App Store and check for updates there as soon as you get settled.\n\nFirst, it\u2019ll give the computer something to do after you get there so you\u2019re not immediately assaulted with tech support requests, and second, it\u2019ll get the most time-consuming part of the whole family tech support process out of the way. Let those updates run, install, reboot, and repeat until they\u2019re all done. Then you can move on to other things where you actually need to sit and use the thing.\n\n9. Install (or Verify they Have) Virus Protection and Anti-Malware\n\nOf course, which antivirus and anti-malware tools you install on your parents\u2019, sibling\u2019s, cousin\u2019s, or other family member\u2019s PC is entirely up to you, but make sure they have something, because you can\u2019t always trust \u201cgood internet hygeine\u201d to protect you, and you definitely can\u2019t always trust it in someone whose messes you would have to clean up if something bad happens.\n\nOnce you make sure they have some protection\u2014or if they already do\u2014make sure it\u2019s in good working order, has been at least semi-recently updated, and run a system scan, just for good measure. After all, anti-malware is useless if it\u2019s never been updated or used.\n\n8. Update Their Browsers and Extensions\n\nEvery modern web browser updates itself these days, and usually on restart whenever there\u2019s a new version to download, but if someone in your family is using a version that\u2019s so old that it doesn\u2019t, or they\u2019re using an outdated browser in the first place, now\u2019s a good time to get them up to speed.\n\nMaybe they\u2019re using browser extensions that turned out to be malware (or just generally untrustworthy) and they never replaced them with trustworthy ones. Being home for the holidays is a good time to swap those out as well and give them the gift of a little more internet privacy.\n\n7. Uninstall Crapware or Unnecessary Programs\n\nWhether it\u2019s a Mac or a Windows computer, nothing gives you a better immediate experience with your machine than uninstalling OEM crapware and any other applications and services running quietly in the background that you really don\u2019t need. Get rid of them and give your family back a PC that\u2019s faster as a result.\n\nGrab a copy of Decrap for Windows and let it do its job, pulling out all the useless tools your PC manufacturer decided you had to have, like \u201csupport and help\u201d tools that are just glorified links to the support section of their web site, or some DVD authoring tool you\u2019ll never use. Then, grab a copy of Revo Uninstaller, our favorite app uninstaller for Windows or AppCleaner, our favorite for Mac, and get rid of the rest of the stuff your family member just doesn\u2019t use. They won\u2019t notice the crap is gone, but they will notice a faster PC.\n\n6. Automate Everything You Can\n\nGo back through their favorite apps, settings, and tools, and automate everything you possibly can. System updates? Set those to automatically install overnight, or during \u201cQuiet Hours,\u201d when the computer isn\u2019t in use. Same for your backups. Configure all of your family member\u2019s favorite applications to automatically download updates and security patches, and then install them the next time the app opens.\n\nEssentially, if there\u2019s anything you can automate, do it, and let them know that you\u2019ve done it. That way you\u2019ll never need to field the call that some driver says it has an update and they don\u2019t know what to do, or some other app says there\u2019s a new version and they\u2019re not sure how to handle it. Just let it all happen automatically.\n\n5. Run a Few Speed Tests Now, So You Have Ammo Later\n\nThis may seem silly, but while things are otherwise working and normal, hit up and run a bandwidth test. Do a little light benchmarking of your family\u2019s computer, while you\u2019re at it. It may seem like unnecessary overkill, but it gives you a frame of reference from which you can interpret any real problems.\n\nIf you understand what their broadband speeds look like under normal conditions, you\u2019ll know when they complain about slowness whether it\u2019s their computer or home network versus their service provider. If you know how hot their CPU actually runs, you\u2019ll be able to tell if it\u2019s overheating. A little note-taking now will save you from having to make guesses\u2014even if they\u2019re educated ones\u2014later on when they\u2019re asking you to fix whatever problem they\u2019re having quickly.\n\n4. Set Them Up With Useful, DIY Resources\n\nLook, I worked in IT for a long time, and even my best attempts at getting people to educate themselves and learn how their computers and applications worked often met with \u201cbut I can just call you, you\u2019ll help!\u201d\u2014if not said aloud, definitely in attitude. Even so, for every four or five people who did react that way, there was one who really did want to learn, and really did want to be self-sufficient. Do it for them.\n\nGive them a little list of links or tools they can use to troubleshoot their own problems, and where they can learn more about how their technology works. Maybe you even point them here to Lifehacker or our Lifehacker U online courses, and they can learn a little tech for themselves.\n\n3. Back Up their Data, and Set Up Regular Backups\n\nEvery hard drive fails, it\u2019s just a matter of when\u2014and that\u2019s why everyone needs good, robust backups to make sure they don\u2019t lose precious, irreplaceable data. When we say \u201crobust,\u201d we mean following the old 3-2-1 backup rule: 3 backups (two isn\u2019t enough if it\u2019s important), 2 different formats (as in, dropbox and an external hard drive, or an external hard drive and DVDs), and 1 offsite backup (if your house burns down or is burglarized and you lose your computer and that shiny external hard drive, how will you recover?)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to set up a bulletproof backup system with just a few minutes of effort. If something like Crashplan, our favorite, is too complicated, consider another simpler, more streamlined tool to get the job done. You could even use built-in tools like Windows Backup in Windows 10, or Time Machine in macOS. Whatever it is, get it done so no one calls you in a panic saying they lost all of their photos, music, or a super important document or paper. Oh, and make sure to test restores too, before you go home.\n\n2. Install a Remote Management Tool\n\nWhen it comes to being the family tech support, the best thing I ever did was install Teamviewer on my father\u2019s computer. He doesn\u2019t often need my help, but when he does, it\u2019s so much easier to connect to his computer remotely and see what he sees than to try and interpret his descriptions of an app I don\u2019t use or settings screen I\u2019ve never seen and guide him through it.\n\nTeamviewer not your style? We have plenty of alternatives that also get the job done\u2014but it\u2019s a huge help, and way better than sitting on the phone saying \u201cClick the button it\u2019s right there\u201d and hearing \u201cWhat button, Idon\u2019t see a button\u201d over and over.\n\n1. Get Out of Doing It In the Future\n\nFinally, the biggest thing you can do\u2014at least for your own sanity\u2014is to politely bow out of being the family tech support in the future. If you don\u2019t enjoy it (and some people do!) sometimes it\u2019s better to just save everyone the frustration and give your loved ones some more options to help themselves, or get help somewhere else without having to call you to come to the rescue.\n\nIllustration by Sam Woolley.

        "text":"Top rated 6 Cost-free VPNs You need to use\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for free vpns, look no further. I\u2019ll show you where to get the very best free vpns that will guard your id and keep the transactions safe. There are so many options out there today, but you will find only a few that basically work and are highly recommended. Here, I\u2019ll be suggesting what vpns I would highly recommend to use in order to keep identity safeguarded while surfing on the net today.\n\nCost-free VPNS surely have their limitations: Fewer associations. Free VPNS may collect and transmit your information to isolated machines for advertising campaign purposes. Totally free VPNS definitely will infect your devices with malicious spyware and adware. Free VPNS often trickle sensitive personal data (especially IP leaks) which may damage you or perhaps the people who are around you.\n\nCompared to the hazards included in free vpns, I would get Paid VPN providers a lot more worthy of awareness. Especially if you are going to use consumer networks just like Facebook or Twitter exactly where your security is extremely important. When it comes to searching the net, absolutely free providers not necessarily worth considering and so they certainly aren\u2019t worth your hard earned cash. completely anonymous while you benefit from the internet.\n\nAnother popular no cost vpn is certainly IP Changer, which offers an advanced collection of coverage including devious tunneling, prevention of hackers, and encryption of internet traffic, which makes it highly challenging for however, most decided hacker compete in. The reason why IP Changer is extremely popular is because of the unique characteristic of using an oblong encryption method called Elliptic Contour Digital Personal unsecured (ECD). This form of encryption is more complex than IP Sec VPN, but is much harder to hack. IP Changer also offers a free of charge version with limited efficiency.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

        "text":"In case you weren\u2019t aware, a speed VPN is a virtual private network that allows you to safely and securely browse the Internet. What once was a tool generally used by high-security businesses and employees is now making its way into the mainstream world of everyday Internet users.\n\nmainstreamThere are so many great benefits that can be gained from using VPN servers in your everyday Internet browsing aside from high security and privacy. Improved Internet connection speeds, and upload speeds and download speeds, obtain a secret IP address from a VPN provider or through a free VPN, and much more.\n\nRead on to learn what a speed VPN is, the benefits of a VPN connection and why you should really be using a VPN provider to get the most out of your Internet speed.\n\nWhat is a Speed VPN?\n\nSpeed VPNs are virtual private networks that are made up of a group of computers\u2014or discrete networks\u2014networked together over a more public network. Basically, what all this complicated jargon means is that a VPN is a network that can be used for ultimate privacy because often people have to have special access to get onto a private VPN either through a paid subscription or a password.\n\ngroup of computersVPNs also allow businesses and employees to access the same network even when they\u2019re not in the same physical location. This is helpful for remote employees located across the world to access sensitive business information and files without having to be on a company computer.\n\nVPNs are much more secure than public networks that often can\u2019t be trusted because of easy access to confidential information like passwords and credit card information that hackers can get on a public network.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a remote worker, student, or just love the Internet, VPNs are a great tool for everybody. Now that you understand what a speed VPN actually is and how it works, we\u2019re going to talk about reasons why you should be using a VPN for your everyday Internet browsing.\n\nAccess to Resources\n\nIf you\u2019re currently a student or an employee of a company, you can really benefit from a speed VPN\u2019s access to valuable resources. For example, more universities have VPNs that allow students to access resource materials, online books, PDFs, and course work securely and quickly.\n\ncoffee shopThe same goes for businesses that need a way for employees to access sensitive files and private materials. VPNs allow you to access these valuable resources anywhere you need to, whether you\u2019re in class, at the office, or even a coffee shop.\n\nMost businesses and schools already have their own VPNs or subscriptions, so you generally don\u2019t have to worry about looking for the best service out there for you.\n\nDownloading Media\n\nAnother great benefit of using a speed VPN is having the ability to download media like music and movies online. While we would never encourage illegally downloading any kind of media, there are some people who just can\u2019t help themselves.\n\nWhether you\u2019re downloading things legally or illegally, VPNs are a great way to keep your files secure and keep yourself off of anybody\u2019s radar. If you\u2019ve got a torrenting app installed on your computer, it\u2019s best to play it safe and stick with using a VPN so you don\u2019t wind up in court or paying hefty fines.\n\nKeep Your Communication Private\n\nSome people are just more paranoid (or careful as they would say) about Internet security. Whether it\u2019s because you\u2019ve had a bad experience in the past such as identity theft or fraud, or you just like taking extra precautions to help you avoid being the victim of online hackers, speed VPNs are the perfect solution for you.\n\nanonymous-studio-figure-photography-facial-mask-38275VPNs allow you to work with sensitive information like handling your bank account, buying things online with a credit card, or inputting materials like your social security number or driver\u2019s license onto digital forms in a safe and secure environment.\n\nYou could even do all of these things in a public space like a caf\u00e9 or the airport without ever having to worry about hackers stealing your information or identity.\n\nTraveling Abroad\n\nIf you\u2019re a digital nomad, an avid traveler, or are just out of the country for vacation VPNs can be lifesavers when traveling abroad. Most people don\u2019t know this, but when you\u2019re in a different country, you don\u2019t have access to the same online streaming services that you do in the US.\n\nNetflix 1It\u2019s complicated and varies by region, but we\u2019re sorry to tell you that your dreams of binge watching Pretty Little Liars while laying on a beach in the Caribbean is probably not going to happen unless you have a VPN. VPNs allow you to securely connect to a network in the US that tricks your computer into thinking you\u2019re actually in the US.\n\nWith the magic of a VPN, you can stream all of your favorite Netflix shows, listen to your Spotify account and even watch live TV on broadcasting websites. Your airport layovers just got a little bit better.\n\nSome of the Best Speed VPNs on the Market\n\nThis is a list of some of the fastest VPNs on the market in 2017. They will all provide you the security, privacy, and ease of access you need to get all your work, studying and streaming done wherever you are.\n\n  \u2022 BufferedBuffered\n\nThis VPN is one of the oldest private networks around. Its awesome features include servers in 37 different countries, unbeatable speeds and up to 5 connections at the same time. The best part is, you can try buffered for free up to 30 days and if you don\u2019t like it they\u2019ll give you your money back no problem.\n\n  \u2022 ExpressVPN\n\nThis VPN has a large following and a lot of users. It\u2019s popular because its service follows its name. ExpressVPN is one of the fastest speed VPNs on the market and includes apps for popular platforms so you can use it on all of your devices. It\u2019s extremely affordable and comes with amazing encryption and a 30-day money back guarantee.\n\n  \u2022 Vyprvpn\n\nVyprvpnIf you aren\u2019t sure whether or not you\u2019re into the whole VPN thing, you can easily take vyprvpn out for a three-day test drive for free. This speed VPN service claims to be the vastest in the world, and it customers aren\u2019t saying otherwise.\n\nWith an easy to use interface, high-quality software and over 700 worldwide servers, vyprvpn is a great option for those new to the VPN game.\n\n  \u2022 IPVanish VPN\n\nIPVanish VPN is a great option if you\u2019re looking to use your VPN service mainly for streaming and downloading. It boasts fast speeds and servers in 60 different countries so you can get your Netflix on while sipping a drink on an exotic beach. This option is one of the most affordable on this list and comes with a seven-day money-back guarantee. If you\u2019re looking to VPN on a budget, definitely check this one out.\n\n  \u2022 VPNArea\n\nLast but not least, VPNArea is a virtual private network that is available for a variety of popular platforms and comes with a list of great features. It\u2019s cheap, it works great, and its speeds are fast. What more could you ask for in a VPN service? It\u2019s not the fastest speed VPN on this list, but it\u2019s still a great option that won\u2019t break the bank.\n\n\n\nComments are closed.",

        "text":"Data insecurity is a major concern in our time. Statistics show that, globally,\u00a0a hacking attempt occurs every 39 seconds. Hackers primarily target vulnerable individuals and small businesses with a malicious intent of phishing out sensitive information for financial gain. To be on the safe side, businesses and individuals have resorted to using various cybersecurity measures to keep their data safe. One of the popular options is the use of cloud storage as a backup media to prevent cyber-theft. To be on the safe side when using the cloud for various data handling practices, you need to be aware of 6 major tips on how to keep your cloud data safe.\n\nImplement access control\n\nAnyone having access to the cloud can use manipulative ways to gain access to your data stored there. You, therefore, need to safeguard your data from third-party and unauthorized access by setting up access control measures. Access controls are all about classifying data and regulating the individuals who access it by setting passwords and other forms of authentication. Using strong passwords by setting up strong character combinations is a great way of safeguarding against hacking attempts.\n\nDo not store sensitive data\n\nThe kind of data you store or handle in the cloud should not be overly sensitive. Personal and banking information, including social security numbers, business registration details, banking details, and bank statements should never be stored on the cloud where they are vulnerable. Avoiding storage of such sensitive information on the cloud ensures that you are on the safe side if a hacker successfully penetrates and accesses your data.\n\nUse data encryption\n\nEncryption has been classified by experts as one of the best ways to protect your data against malicious use. Any data being transmitted to and from your cloud storage as well as being stored there should be appropriately protected with a strong encryption key. The encryption ensures that persons who illegally access the files cannot make sense of it. An easy and readily available way of encrypting your data is by compressing and storing it in zip files which are then password-protected. Alternatively, you may use strong, recommended encryption techniques that are hacking-proof.\n\nMake use of data backups\n\nCreating a data backup is a great way of ensuring the integrity of your data. Every piece of data stored on your cloud storage medium should have an alternative regularly-updated storage location. This measure is meant to protect you from malicious data hacking in situations where hackers manipulate your data to cripple your business\u2019s operations. The backups should be updated daily to ensure that no sensitive data is lost in case of a malicious attack.\n\nMake use of anti-virus and anti-spyware software\n\nHackers have come up with sophisticated viruses that are capable of spying the data stored in your cloud storage media. Such a virus program only needs to append itself of your cloud storage location to siphon out vital information. As a safeguard against this, you should endeavor to ensure that your cloud storage and data handling locations are well protected by antivirus, anti-malware, and anti-spyware software. The programs should also be set to automatically update themselves to be well equipped with the latest data protection mechanisms.\n\nHave a cloud policy\n\nIf your business has a cloud data handling platform, the chances are that you are not the only person accessing the data from the cloud. The likelihood of your employees compromising on the strong data policies you have put in place is very high. To be on the safe side, in this regard, you need to ensure that all your employees are well trained on a strong\u00a0cloud security policy. The employees, for instance, should understand the various relevant cybersecurity practices that are necessary to keep the organizational data safe. The policy should be updated regularly to stay at par with the rising breed of sophisticated hackers.\n\nObserving these tips when it comes to handling and storing data on your cloud ensures that hackers do not stand a chance to compromise on your data\u2019s safety. Performing regular assessments and audits on your cybersecurity practices ensure that you stay on top of your game as far as keeping your cloud data safe is concerned.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"02:00 PM\nJoshua Goldfarb\nJoshua Goldfarb\nConnect Directly\nE-Mail vvv\n\n20 Questions for SecOps Platform Providers\n\nSecurity operations capabilities for the masses is long overdue. Here's how to find a solution that meets your budget and resources.\n\nThe security operations platform is quickly emerging as a favorite talking point for 2017, even for organizations that do not find themselves with an expansive budget to improve their security maturity and posture. Of course, doing so is a complex undertaking with a wide variety of moving parts. Or is it?\n\nHistorically, advanced SecOps has been beyond the reach and resources for all but the most elite organizations. Today, the cloud has opened up new possibilities for these enhanced capabilities at reduced cost. This, in turn, creates new opportunities for mid-sized and smaller enterprise-sized organizations.\n\nOf course, where there is interest, there are vendors ready to pounce. Lately, there are quite a few vendors talking about their security operations platforms. How can the conscientious security buyer interrogate potential vendors to make the most-informed decision? As you might guess, I would suggest a game of 20 questions.\n\n1. How do you make it easy to seamlessly operationalize intelligence? Reliable, high-fidelity intelligence is an important component of a mature security operations capability. Plenty of vendors offer intelligence, and I have already discussed how to differentiate between different intelligence offerings. But there is another important point worth mentioning here. The greatest intelligence in the world won\u2019t help an organization if it can\u2019t operationalize it. In other words, if it isn\u2019t easy for you to leverage intelligence to help defend your organization, it is more or less useless.\n\n2. How do you facilitate risk mitigation? Everyone knows that security is all about risk mitigation. But if knowledge about risks and threats to the organization cannot be operationalized to help manage and mitigate risk, that knowledge is wasted.\n\n3. Do you honestly believe that I want more alerts? I am suffering from a bad case of alert fatigue. What I need is help making order out of the chaos, and turning all of that information into knowledge.\u00a0\n\n4. Where is my context? Alerts without the appropriate context do not provide a true understanding of what is going on. That makes it difficult for organizations to make educated, informed decisions. Context is king.\n\n5. Can you provide me protection against a variety of attack vectors that compromise organizations? If a security operations platform cannot cover multiple different attack vectors, it isn\u2019t going to cut it.\n\n6. Can you help me see? The importance of proper visibility across the network, endpoints, mobile, cloud, and SaaS is huge. If you can\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t detect it.\n\n7.\u00a0How do you model attacker behavior? The best way to identify attacker behavior within an organization is to deeply understand different characteristics of that behavior, model them, and subsequently develop algorithms that recognize them. Simply developing algorithms without understanding how attackers attack isn\u2019t going to be very productive.\n\n8. How is your performance? Security operations is about both collection and analysis. It isn\u2019t enough to collect vast quantities of data. Any reasonable SecOps platform needs to be able to allow analysts to interrogate that data rapidly.\n\n9. Do you have integrated case management? The \u201cswivel chair\u201d effect, and the days of cutting and pasting manually between different systems needs to come to an end. If the analysis and investigation I am doing cannot be fed automatically into a case or ticket, that isn\u2019t going to work for me.\n\n10. How do you scale? I want to know that as my needs grow, I can buy additional capacity and functionality as necessary without a long, complex, and disruptive deployment cycle.\n\n11. How do you provide integration between distinct components in a diverse security ecosystem? My security ecosystem is diverse, and you need to be able to help me maximize and optimize my existing investments.\n\n12. How flexible is your query language? Can I ask precise, incisive, targeted questions? If your query language does not support that, it is not helpful.\n\n13.\u00a0Can you augment my existing talent? Although I want to run security operations 24x7, that\u2019s not a realistic expectation, given my current resources. How can you augment my staff to help us get there?\n\n14.\u00a0Do you provide seamless pivoting across a wide variety of data sources? I don\u2019t have time to issue multiple queries across multiple different systems to get the relevant data that I need.\u00a0 If you can\u2019t provide me a single interface to all of the data across my security ecosystem, I\u2019m not interested.\n\n15. Do you have an integrated automation and orchestration capability? Manual processes are inefficient and error-prone. I need to take advantage of automation and orchestration, but it needs to be integrated into the platform for that platform to be realistic.\n\n16. Will you end my cutting and pasting nightmare? In 2017, seamless integration between alerting, analysis, investigation, case management, and documentation should be a given.\n\n17. Can you help me free up resources for higher order work? It is not a good use of time or money to have analysts spending most of their time performing clerical tasks. I need them to focus on higher-order work.\n\n18.\u00a0 Do you have real analytics based on real knowledge of attacker behavior? Everyone talks about analytics these days. But the only analytics that stand a chance of reliably detecting attacker behavior with low noise are analytics based on intimate knowledge of attacker behavior.\n\n19. Do you support flexible deployment options? Any realistic platform needs to be easily consumable in a variety of different ways.\n\n20. Is your solution affordable? The time to bring security operations to the masses is long overdue. In order to make that a reality, any solution needs to suit my budget.\n\nRelated Content:\n\nJosh (Twitter: @ananalytical) is an experienced information security leader who works with enterprises to mature and improve their enterprise security programs.\u00a0 Previously, Josh served as VP, CTO - Emerging Technologies at FireEye and as Chief Security Officer for ...

        "text":"Thursday, December 15, 2011\n\nZed's Digital Audio Top 10 of 2011\n\nUploaded with Skitch!\n\nThis list is made up of those plug-ins and digital apps I used the most this year and\/or made me the most excited. Most are available for both PC and Mac, and only a few are still stuck in 32-bit mode - hopefully that will change soon.\n\n10) Izotope Ozone 5. Link This is the Mastering app of choice for most semi-pro engineer\/producers and a great update to the ubiquitous Ozone 4 multi-processor - albeit slightly expensive for the \"Pro\" version without the introductory discount. The Pro version allows you to insert each module as a separate plug-in if you so desire, and has awesome audio visualisation options (plus a few extra features per module). Within this plug-in you get all the essential tools to repair a finished mix - a mastering limiter (Maximizer),\u00a0 multi-band compression, multi-band exciter, multi-band width controls (Imager), mastering reverb, and an awesome EQ with handy frequency \"solo\" for ease of locating those crazy out of control frequencies. Oh, and you can go stereo or mid-side depending on your needs, and you also get all sorts of dithering and metering options.\n\n9) SoundIron Emotional Piano 2Link It's amazing how often you need a piano in a mix, and because I don't have access to real one, I'm always struggling to find one that sits nicely in a song, especially as the ubiquitous grand pianos that seem to come with various packages don't always work with the track. This piano is meant to be more \"soundtrack-ey\", it's warm, has character, and seems to sit much better than any of the others. If I want a clean sound I use Modart's Pianoteq Link - a very nice modelled piano.\n\n8) Avid Pro Tools 10Link Just so you know, although I'm a Logic Pro afficianado, I'm also a trained Pro Tools user and it's good to see Pro Tools coming along so well and, although they've had the studio-recording side totally nailed for so long (and are the industry-standard for recording in the studio), they are still catching up somewhat with everyone else in the compositional features stakes. Also - now you don't need to have a piece of Avid hardware to run it, it simplifies (and cheapens) your setup. Still a bit overpriced (especially as you have to pay quite a bit extra for much of the really cool stuff), but if you want to work with a variety of studios, you will probably need to use it at some point.\n\n7) Arts Acoustic ReverbLink This algorithmic reverb is not only easy on the CPU, it sounds fantastic. I think our love-affair with the impulse reverb is fading, because as good as they initially sound, they are inherently linear - the sound doesn't change based on level going in, so they can end up being a bit sterile. I think of them as \"precision reverbs\". The Arts Acoustic can still sound clean, but you can get some pretty twisted sounds out of it if you need to, or some gorgeous Lexicon-like warmth. I use it a lot for dark and twisted drum reverbs, and for clean and open vocal reverb.\n\n6) Logic Pro 9Link Notice it's not at number 1, because as much as it's my main tool in the studio, and it IS pretty damn awesome, (and ridiculously good value for money BTW - especially as you can now buy it on App Store for $200 USD) Apple have let it sit in the background for a while now, with very few updates, and some bugs that have been there for several years. I'm hoping that they release version 10 soon, without destroying what makes it so good - like they almost did with Final Cut Pro X. Runners up - Ableton Live\u00a0Link - you'd have to have your head in the sand not to notice this DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) app increasingly dominating the market - although mostly in DJ, electronica and live performance realms, and Reaper\u00a0Link - an inexpensive and increasingly fully-featured application that's really taking off.\n\n5) SoundToys Devil-Loc DeluxeLink Actually the entire Sound Toys native bundle is also fantastic (and pretty well priced if you're a student and can get the Academic pricing), but I've found this particular compression-with-distortion plug-in an essential for big fat drum sounds. You can get it pumping in a really good way, and it sure adds instant excitement to the drum mix.\n\n4) D16 Group ToraverbLink This plug-in reverb can get the biggest, widest, lushest chorused reverb sounds ever. It's very impressive, and once you hear it, you'll want it. I use it every time I need a huge sense of space and distance on something in my mix. Actually the D-16 Group do some fantastic plug-ins - I have the rest of the Silverline collection and also use the Decimort (which can emulate the colouration from various older samplers) and Devastator (a multi-band distortion unit) plug-ins a lot.\n\n3) Slate Digital VCC (Virtual Console Collection)Link The idea with this plugin is that you put it on every channel strip and\/or the busses to simulate one of four (now five!) analogue mixing consoles. It's very subtle per channel strip, but somehow adds up to making a mix sound great and just \"gel\". Runner-up to this is the very affordable Sonimus Satson Buss Link.\n\n2)\u00a0Celemony Melodyne Editor 2Link When it comes time to transparently fix poor intonation in vocals, without the obvious side-effects that you might want for some styles of music, then Melodyne is the one. It retains the nuances of phrasing and vibrato, and allows you to just fix the gross pitch errors if you like, or you can still go more extreme if you really want to. Also great for matching and creating backing vocal lines, repairing guitar tracks (got one string out of tune?) as it can now do polyphonic tracks, and my favourite; fixing poorly-played bass lines, because you can quantize to a time grid as well as fixing poor intonation on cheap basses. There are a bunch of products that Celemony put out, including the multi-track Melodyne Studio, but I like this one as it's a pretty full-featured plug-in that can also do Rewire. An absolute essential!\n\n1) Anything by UADLink This was my big \"Eureka\" moment this year. I decided to buy the UAD-2 Solo Laptop card to get some more processing into my overstressed Mac Book Pro laptop. Here's what I found - the UAD plug-ins sound so much better than any other versions of the same plug-in, and sound so very close to the real hardware units that they're modelling. You don't need \"golden ears\" to tell the difference either. It might have something to do with the way the plug-ins are up-sampled for processing, or it might be the ridiculous huge amount of detailed modelling that they've done to recreate the vintage equipment so realistically. My favourites so far are the good old Pultec EQ - it really does just make things sound better - even without adding any EQ (although you probably will), the Ampex ATR-102 reel-to-reel, the Fatso Jr\/Sr for, well, fatness, and the SPL Vitalizer for adding character to synths. My credit card is still hurting from going a wee bit crazy on these plug-ins this year, but I don't regret it.\n\nNotable mentions: the free Michael Norris effects collection\u00a0Link for some quite radical granular processing options - especially useful for sound design. Some of the cool Waves plugins Link; for example the Kramer MPX reel-to-reel tape recorder and the Vocal Rider Not cheap, but good. Xfer Records' LFOTool\u00a0Link - adds tweakable sync'ed modulation to just about anything. Great for locking-in, enhancing or creating grooves in any track. Izotope's Stutter Edit\u00a0Link - awesome for adding those extra crazy head-sounds to your mix and for creating some extra action when it gets too boring - and you can play it in from a MIDI keyboard. The Sonnox collection\u00a0Link - every single plug-in is useful and just sound awesome. And they've dropped the prices so real people can now almost afford them. Cytomic's \"The Glue\" Link - a really excellent analogue-modelled master bus processor that you just set and forget.",

Here are 11 free apps that deliver the goods.\n\nTwitter is all about keeping things brief. It is, after all, a microblogging service, one that limits you to 140 characters per post. But while Twitter promotes a less-is-more approach, the same can't be said of the market for Twitter apps and services. You can barely turn a corner on the Web these days without finding one, whether it's a desktop program aimed at organizing your social media life or a search engine claiming to offer the next best way to cull the tweets you want to read. Of course, not all of those apps are equal--but we've found 11 free tools and services that mostly improve on the Twitter experience.\n\n(For links to all of these downloads in one convenient list, see our \"Twitter Tools: 11 Free Apps and Services You Need Now\" collection.)\n\nMultinetwork Support\n\nSince Twitter is just one of many social networks that most people use these days, a lot of Twitter management apps support additional services such as Facebook and LinkedIn. The following products can help you manage multiple social media accounts.\n\nAlthough TweetDeck is owned by the folks at Twitter, it lets you manage both your Facebook account and multiple Twitter accounts within one sensible, easy-to-navigate application. TweetDeck has long been a favorite of Twitter power users, and it's easy to see why: This application lets you prepost and schedule tweets, find items via powerful search tools, and manage an unlimited number of Twitter accounts. Its interface employs a column arrangement that can get a little crowded at times, but you can customize it to your liking. And this desktop program now comes with a cloud-based counterpart, so you can access it across multiple computers.\n\nThe strictly Web-based SocialOomph suffers a bit from its plain-Jane interface. If you can look beyond its limitations, however, you'll find it to be a pretty powerful Twitter management tool. Like TweetDeck, SocialOomph lets you manage an unlimited number of Twitter accounts and allows you to schedule tweets for posting on your schedule. But SocialOomph also emphasizes the social nature of Twitter, by helping you promote yourself in order to find new followers and assisting you in identifying and locating high-quality accounts to follow. On top of that, SocialOomph's support extends to Facebook, as well as to several popular blogging services.\n\nLike SocialOomph, HootSuite is purely cloud-based, but it sports a slick, attractive interface. Its dashboard offers a centralized location for tracking multiple social media accounts, including those on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn. HootSuite's basic features compare nicely to those of both TweetDeck and SocialOomph, as it too permits you to schedule tweets, manage direct messages, and view @ replies easily. Business users in particular will appreciate the statistics that HootSuite delivers, which allow you to see whether your tweets are gaining traction.\n\nIf you're a social networker who's really, really social, you'll like Seesmic Desktop 2. This application (and its Web-based counterpart, Seesmic Web) supports more than 90 third-party services through its integrated marketplace. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn,, and Salesforce Chatter are just the tip of the iceberg; Seesmic also supports other apps and services such as Klout, Stocktwits, Yammer, and ZenDesk.\n\nThe slick-looking Sobees desktop application helps you manage the big three of social media: Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. You can use it to update your status across one or more of the networks at the same time, and easily search Twitter. Sobees also points you toward trending topics on Twitter, but since much of this information is labeled 'Sponsored content', it's difficult to determine how hot a topic really is.\n\nIf you want to keep a little distance between your Twitter and Facebook accounts, don't worry: You don't need a full-featured management tool to do so. A little utility like Selective Tweets can help. This Facebook app lets you send certain tweets over to Facebook simply by ending them with #fb. It doesn't get any easier than that.\n\nFocusing on Twitter\n\nNot interested in a multipronged app that supports numerous social networks? Consider, a Twitter app from Hollywood's Twitter king, Ashton Kutcher. Developed in conjunction with UberSocial, Kutcher's app offers a decent set of features, such as the ability to view Web-based content directly within the app via its LivePreview panel. Be warned, however: If your tolerance for all things Ashton Kutcher are low, you may quickly tire of the app's A+ panel, which provides easy access to Kutcher's Twitter feed as well as that of his soon-to-be-ex-wife Demi Moore, along with a few feeds of his choosing. You can hide that panel--but if you do, you might as well use something else.\n\nIf you're seeking a dedicated Twitter app that's light on celebrity influence, consider Blu. Developed as a concept application for Windows 7, Blu is certainly slick. It's more than just a pretty face, though, as this Twitter app lets you easily view your Twitter timeline, @ mentions, favorites, retweets, and more.\n\nIf you're finding Twitter a bit overwhelming, give PostPost a try. This free service helps you dig through the chaos of Twitter to find content that's personally relevant. PostPost's latest version includes a new Timeline Topline feature, which pulls in the topics, links, photos, and videos from your Twitter timeline that are most appropriate for you. The service determines what's relevant by examining your Twitter account and how you use it. PostPost artfully arranges some of the Twitter content you most want to see--and even stuff you didn't know you wanted to see.\n\nAnother service that's designed to help you dig through the boatloads of information on Twitter is Tweetmeme. It does the job by collecting what it deems to be the hottest links on Twitter, and presenting them to you in an attractive layout. Tweetmeme is easy on the eyes, and quite simple to figure out, as it clearly tells you how many times a link has been tweeted, but its usefulness is limited due to its emphasis on links and only links.\n\nLooking to gain more followers on Twitter? Turn to Twellow. This online directory service, which bills itself as \"The World's Largest Twitter Directory,\" lets you list yourself so that potential followers can find you more easily. It supplies a neatly organized Twitter directory, arranged into categories and subcategories, that helps you find folks to follow.\n\nFollow Us\n\nJoin the newsletter!\n\nError: Please check your email address.\nShow Comments",
