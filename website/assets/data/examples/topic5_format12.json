        "text":"About Us \u2013 Network Outfitters\n\nSimply put, Network Outfitters is the fastest, easiest way to get the new, refurbished or pre-owned networking equipment you need at the best possible price. Guaranteed. But that\u2019s just part of the story.\n\nDR4001103-E6 FrontOur founder, Kurt Rawlings has been in the networking industry since 1987.\n\nFrom 1987 \u2013 2000 Kurt was the Co-Owner and VP of sales and marketing at Computer Recyclers in Utah.\n\nComputer Recyclers was a pioneer in it\u2019s day to start the Ecycling movement.\n\nAfter several years and many lessons learned, Kurt Rawlings founded Network Outfitters in 2000 because he saw an increased opportunity to provide better value and better service than the market was currently offering.\n\nAnd it\u2019s working. Our business has grown year over year. That\u2019s because we treat our customers the way we\u2019d want to be treated. Our customers, in turn, have rewarded us through their repeat business and referrals.\n\nWe\u2019re able to do what we do because the market for networking equipment is unique. For one thing, pre-owned and refurbished equipment represents an enormous cost savings compared to new, and it is generally unavailable from the manufacturers or their VARS. Not only are we able to provide a lower cost alternative, we can do so without the typical lead times and with much stronger warranty programs than buying direct.\n\nAlso, the market for this equipment is fragmented. It can be difficult, time-consuming and often impossible for systems integrators, IT consultants, network architects, government or education network support professionals, and end users to locate needed hardware, let alone a reputable supplier.\n\nft-logoThat\u2019s where we come in. Through our many combined years in the industry, we\u2019ve developed an extensive source network for pre-owned, refurbished and new networking equipment. Our products are thoroughly tested, backed by an industry leading warranty, and, more importantly, you\u2019ll always know where to find us after the sale. Why spend days or weeks tracking down the hardware you need and gamble on the quality and reliability of the equipment and the vendor? Chances are we have it in stock or can source it for immediate shipment. And we\u2019ll guarantee the quality, and get it to you at a much better price than you could find on your own.\n\nFinally, we understand the importance of network continuity and realize that downtime is simply not acceptable. We\u2019ve made it our mission to place our customers\u2019 needs first. Our automated processing enables us to expedite orders tailored specifically to your delivery requirements. We process final invoices and provide tracking information before you ever have a chance to wonder about the status of your order. In this dynamic business, your needs can change in an instant. Our talented and intuitive staff is ready and willing to adapt on the fly to ensure you\u2019re satisfied with the products and the service you receive from us.\n\nThough our company has grown over the years, we\u2019re still here every day, ensuring that our sales staff delivers the high standard of customer service we established ourselves from day one. And even though we have fancy job titles on our business cards now, we\u2019re not above personally taking phone orders or sending out quotes. At Network Outfitters, customer service is part of everyone\u2019s job description.\n\n\nWhen you are looking for new, pre-owned, or refurbished networking equipment from any of\u00a0 the\u00a0 major manufactures, you deserve an easy, hassle-free shopping experience. Our goal is simple: deliver maximum value, impress you with our service, and earn your repeat business.\n\nWhether you request a quote online, or call us directly, our goal is to get you the pricing and availability information you need within 30 minutes or less. Usually, that means 15 minutes or less.\n\nNot sure what you need? Our responsive sales staff is experienced in networking infrastructure and product compatibility. From the latest technologies, to second generation and end-of-life parts, we\u2019ll work to help you identify a solution and get it to you at the best possible price.\n\n\nSystems integrators, IT consultants, network architects, government or education network support professionals and end users can count on Network Outfitters\u00a0to provide reliable, application tested, top quality products.\n\n\nLooking for a router, switch, network security hardware, wireless equipment, content or access server, or VOIP telephony? We handle new, refurbished and pre-owned networking equipment from Cisco, HP, Foundry, Juniper, 3COM, Nortel and all other major manufacturers.",
