        "text":"Rapid Clarinet Articulation\n\nby Tony Sanders\n\nI have played clarinet now for many years but could never master the art of fast tonguing saying the word two to strike the reed is o.k. for normal staccato but what about double and triple tonguing as all the books that I have been through don\u2019t show how this is done.\n\nThank you\n\n\nHello Tony,\n\nThanks for the question. I have to say, articulation is hard to teach well, especially the \u201crapid\u201d articulation. I will also tell you that I\u2019m in the human category, I have to WORK at rapid articulation. Some people are gifted and can articulate fast; but I often find that since they have this gift, they do not spend the time getting the rapid articulation with rapid fingers.\n\nI hope that didn\u2019t come off as a rant? The first question I\u2019ll ask, is have you gone through all of my Clarinet-Now.com Articulation pages? Check that link to read the first page and all the links on that page.\n\nIn short, keep your tongue very close to the reed. I mean millimeters away from the reed. Do not tongue like a snake, make the tip of the tongue go up and down (not back and forth). Try to make your articulation as legato as possible. Do this on the chromatic scale or a major scale.\n\nI\u2019ve worked with Kalmen Opperman on articulation for years and am currently working with Steve Hartmann on the same subject. For me to feel good about articulation, I usually have to do a system of chromatic scales that will take an hour to complete. That warms up my tongue and makes sure it works with the fingers. Kal told me once, \u201cIf you wish to articulate well and fast, you need to articulate everything.\u201d So, it might seem weird, but on your next practice session, articulate everything you are practicing (remember, this is just practice, not performance).\n\n\nI have fooled around with double tonguing a little bit and have never tried triple tonguing. It is tougher for clarinetists as we have a mouthpiece and reed inside our mouth. For flutists and brass players, the instrument is still on the outside of the lips.\n\nHowever, say this, \u201cta-ka, ta-ka, ta-ka.\u201d The ta touches the reed. The ka comes lightly from the back of the throat. Try this on one note like a first line E in eighth notes. Try to make the ta and ka sound the same, not one louder or more accented than the other. I\u2019ve never tried triple tonguing, but I believe the concept is like this, \u201cta-ka-ta, ta-ka-ta, ta-ka-ta\u201d on and on.\n\nProbably, if practiced diligently, \"ta-ka-ta, ka-ta-ka,ta-ka-ta,\" on and on. That, my friend, is a tongue twister.\n\nAnother concept of double-tonguing is keeping the tip of the tongue close to the reed and instead of single tonguing just below the tip of the reed, you would keep the tongue back a little bit, and do a double stroke up and down. The tip of the tongue would move up, touch the reed, then off the reed and on the way down, touch the reed again. The tongue would go below the reed (allowing it to vibrate) and then return upwards to stroke the reed again.\n\nI\u2019ve tried this version and believe my tongue is too long to hold back and stroke it up and down like this. However, if I\u2019ve described this well to you, you can see that conceptually it should work easy. Think of taking a guitar pick and strumming one string up and down. That is how this concept works. Single tonguing is like taking the pick and strumming only one way.\n\nAgain, please read through my articulation pages for a more complete description of single tonguing? One of these days I\u2019ll post videos on these subjects. Best to you and let me know how this works out for you.\n\n\nClick here to read or post comments\n\nJoin in and write your own page!

        "text":"Group Warm-Ups\n\n\nMost warming up should be done by the individual as people have different needs as we inferred on the previous page.\u00a0 Since many do not do it, and particularly in choruses, Group Warm-Ups seem necessary.\n\nGroup Warm-Ups are often combined with singing \u201cCrafts\u201d.\u00a0 That is good but it also causes some confusion.\u00a0 Both Craft and Warm-Up activities should have a goal (or more than one goal).\n\nThere are three goals for warming up: 1) awakening the mind, 2) relaxing the body and 3) warming up the voice.\u00a0 But the goal of Crafts is to improve our singing skills and\u00a0 craft activities may require more exertion that is good for the Warm-up activity.\u00a0 Good warm-ups should not require much exertion and thus familiar things are frequently done.\u00a0 Fine!, but people think that anything familiar can be used for warming up.\u00a0 However the voice range and\/or volume may be too much for a Warm-Up activity.\u00a0 Another problem is the Warm-Up activity may end up as meaningless repetition and actually be a waste of precious rehearsal time.\u00a0 Rather using \u201ceasy-on-the-voice-repertoire\u201d and with a goal of improving them, is probably more valuable.\u00a0 But a good warm-up with a clear goal(s) may be even more valuable if the goal(s) are carefully chosen.\n\nWarm-ups should be varied according to the needs of the group considering the three warm-up goals noted above.\u00a0\n\nFor warm-ups with my H.S. guys, we sing the \u201cScale in Syllables\u201d, going up a half step or down a half step.\u00a0 Then we do it with a whole step lift and drop.\u00a0 We also sing the \u201cChromatic Scale\u201d in syllables.\u00a0 This teaches Sight Singing, understanding whole and half steps, making them more alert - as well as warming up the voice.\u00a0 While doing this we also give attention to good vocal production.\n\nWe also use the following \u201cWarm-Up Cool Chords\u201d as a warm up, for tuning and for learning half and whole steps as we do it with lifts and drops. \u00a0You will find that the whole step is harder for the Tenors going up and the Basses and Leads going down as that forces them to go out of the scale tonality.\n\n\nDon\u2019t have much to suggest here but anything that challenges the men or makes them more aware, is good.\n\n\nIf the need is to release tension, then some physical movement can help.\u00a0 Here are some suggestions.\n\n  1. 1. Stretch to the sky and then touch the toes (bend the knees if necessary)\n\n  2. 2. Turn and massage the shoulders of the next member. \u00a0Turn back the other way.\n\n  3. 3. Turn the head in 8 different directions:\u00a0\n\n  4. 1 & 2 Up and Down (Look at the sky, look at your toes)\u00a0\n\n  5. 3 & 4 Left and Right,\u00a0\n\n  6. 5 & 6 Tip head to right \u00a0& then left,\u00a0\n\n  7. 7 & 8 Push head forward the back inward (Turtle Move)\n\n  8. 4. Rub the cheek downward\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would love to hear from you.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I appreciate any comments or suggestions.",

        "text":"How to Book Your Band\n\nIf you would like brokers to guide you, it\u2019s good to shield them. They are going to reduce and black checklist any act that books work immediately on a job they obtained for you. There are just a few fundamentals it\u2019s good to know to ensure that brokers wish to use you.\n\nWholesale\/Retail Pricing\n\nFor instance you need $800.00 for a efficiency. For those who inform individuals who name you or ask you that your price is $800.00, how can the agent make something from reserving you? Brokers do NOT take 10% like within the films. They need a value from you and so they mark it up. For those who ask for $800.00, they make guide you for $1,200.00 and even $1,500.00. In the event that they do, meaning once you discuss on to individuals who might wish to guide you, it\u2019s good to quote your \u201cretail value\u201d. That\u2019s the value an agent will cost on your act. For those who do not, there is no such thing as a approach an agent will make cash and so they will not guide you. Whenever you discuss to brokers converse by way of your retail value and your company value. As quickly as you do, you\u2019ll transfer approach up the pile previous your opponents who do not get this vital idea.\n\nBe Completely satisfied With Your Share\n\nFor those who inform an agent you need $1,00zero.00 for a gig and you discover out they offered it for $three,00zero.00, be joyful. You bought what you needed and you were not ripped off. The extra they make on you, the extra they may guide you. For those who get your value, be glad and joyful.\n\nDo Not Put Contact Information On Promo Supplies\n\nWhenever you create promo supplies, don\u2019t print your contact info on it. This can be a signal to brokers that you just guide immediately. Brokers don\u2019t wish to compete with their acts. Have a spot for contact info on brochures, DVDs and many others however depart it clean so the agent can fill of their contact information.\n\nGet Work For Them\n\nOne of the best ways to get repeat enterprise from an agent or supervisor is to get them work! If you\u2019re on a job they acquired you and somebody comes as much as ask if they\u2019ll guide you, keep away from the temptation to guide the job immediately. When you\u2019re on a job, all contacts belong to the one who acquired you the gig. Don\u2019t give out playing cards, take the title and variety of the one who is . Then, name your agent and provides them the lead. You\u2019ll shoot to the highest of individuals booked by any sincere agent in the event you do that.\n\nBe Simple To Contact\n\nWhen work is available in, brokers need to know instantly in case you are out there. Make certain you give cell numbers that work and get proper again to them to substantiate availability. They will not settle for any excuse. Make certain you have got everlasting numbers that will not be modified and test you messages typically.\n\nAttempt Customized Packages\n\nIf you\u2019re sending a demo DVD of your band or your act, strive going to the company web page, lifting their title and emblem and placing it on the DVD. Open with a graphic with their title and phone information firstly and on the finish of your DVD. The Graphic may say \u201cAcme Leisure is Proud To Current\u201d It might be too ballzy for them however some brokers will likely be impressed and can ship out your DVD instantly to shoppers or put the video on their website.\n\nIf you wish to guide immediately solely BTS, you may ignore these strategies. If you wish to work with brokers strive these strategies and you will notice a giant distinction in how brokers deal with you.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Choosing the location, sending invitations, selecting the food and the entertainment, it all amounts to a bit of an ordeal. Granted, it\u2019s not rocket science, but a misstep here and there can greatly reduce the success of the party.\n\nAs both a parent and a birthday party entertainer, I have experienced all aspects of creating successful birthday parties. The biggest and most important decision you have to make is how to entertain the guests during the party. This guide will help you make the right entertainment decisions for you and your child and give you valuable insight into how to make your child\u2019s birthday party fun and memorable.\n\nDo it Yourself?\nThe first decision you will need to make is whether to hire in-home entertainment, have the party at a \u201cparty place\u201d, provide the entertainment yourself, or some combination of all of these options. Hiring outside entertainment or renting a room or facility obviously costs more money, but doing it yourself is more work. As a magician, I am obviously biased towards recommending the hiring of a professional, but if you have a limited budget you can be creative and provide a fun time on your own.\n\nTraditional do-it-yourself options include pi\u00f1atas, a craft project, and party games such as Pin the Tail on the Donkey or Musical Chairs. However, you can make it more fun with something a bit different. Here are a couple of ideas I have used:\n\nBirthday Banner\nA fun craft idea for young kids is to print out the individual letters in HAPPY BIRTHDAY CAROL (insert birthday child\u2019s name, of course), each on a separate piece of paper. Give one to each child and let them decorate their letter however they wish. Then connect them all and make a big banner that everyone can be proud of.\n\nDecorate Your Own Cupcakes\u00a0\nProvide undecorated cupcakes and let each child add their own combination of frosting, sprinkles, and various small toppings and candies. Yum!\n\nThere are many unique and exciting games you can play at little or no cost to you. Check out the website http:\/\/www.activityvillage.co.uk\/party_games_and_activities.htm for some great examples. You may want to steer clear of games in which kids get eliminated one at a time, as that creates \u201cdowntime\u201d and can lead to boredom and misbehavior from the kids who are eliminated early.\n\nHiring an Entertainer\u00a0\nMany options are available when hiring outside entertainment, so be sure to carefully consider what type of entertainment will fit your needs. The two basic types of entertainers are: 1) One- guest-at-a-time artists and 2) show entertainers.\n\nOne-guest-at-a-time artists\nBalloon twisters and face-painters fall into the first category. I have seen some amazingly beautiful work done by balloon artists and face-painters and if you have the budget, these can be a nice addition. For some top-notch talent in these areas, visit the \u201cLinks\u201d page on my website, www.steveomagic.com. Keep in mind that these artists generally do not entertain everyone at once (though a good balloon artist is fascinating to watch) and you will need to entertain the other guests while the artist is creating their one-guest-at-a-time creations.\n\nShow Entertainers\nShow entertainers provide fun for all of the guests for an allotted amount of time. Magicians and clowns fall into this category. When researching entertainers, consider the age and temperament of your child and the party guests to be sure that the type of entertainer matches the audience. If the child is afraid of clowns in make-up or doesn\u2019t like magic, you may have a problem!\n\nIMPORTANT: Book Early. Most of the highly sought-after entertainers fill their weekend schedules weeks in advance, so the earlier you can get the party scheduled and an entertainer hired, the better.\n\nHere are some things to look for when hiring a show entertainer:\n\n1) Quality. This can be difficult to assess, but check the performer\u2019s website and look for: testimonials from other customers, videos, credentials, and experience. Also, if you know someone who has hired an entertainer and had a good experience with them, chances are you will have positive results as well.\nAlso note whether the performer is a full-time entertainer or performs for parties as a side job or hobby. Some part-time performers have good shows (and I can recommend some), but a full-time entertainer has his or her livelihood at stake and won\u2019t last long without a quality product.\nFinally, try to determine how \u201centertaining\u201d the entertainment is (video demos or word- of-mouth helps here). A clown who just dresses up and looks funny will not be very entertaining for long, nor will a magician who simply performs a series of tricks without providing funny and entertaining routines.\n\n2) Professionalism. Does the performer offer a money-back guarantee? Do they have a quality website? On the phone, do they sound and behave professionally? These are all indicators of whether the performer takes his or her job seriously and if they will deliver what they promise.\nIt is important that you have a good, confident feeling about who you hire. It is common for parents to worry about the person they hired not showing up and ruining little Johnny\u2019s birthday party. One way to help ease those fears is to get the details in writing. I always send a confirmation email to my clients when they hire me describing the date, time, location, cost, and other particulars of the event. Strong communication is key.\nAnother safeguard is to confirm with the entertainer the week of the party. Many performers will contact you, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to go ahead and touch base with them to make sure things are still on track as planned.\n\n3) Services. Find out exactly what they offer. How long is their birthday party show? Are there multiple packages in different price ranges? Is their show appropriate for the age of your child and your guests? Do they offer other options, such as goody bags, games, or balloon animals?\n\n4) Value. Cost is always a consideration, but when pricing entertainers be sure to evaluate VALUE rather than simply cost. You could spend $100 and get a disappointing show that may not have been worth it even at no cost, or spend a bit more and have your guests talking about how much fun your party was days later. The saying \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d is appropriate, though it does not always hold true. Evaluate other criteria as well.\u00a0Also consider if the show has music, live animal productions, stage backdrop, or other features that add value and pizazz to the show.\n\n5) Requirements.\u00a0What are the requirements of their show? How much space do they need? Are there audience size limits? Does the show need to be performed indoors only or is an outdoor show an option? Do they need electricity? What types of payment do they accept? Is a deposit required?\n\nOther Considerations\u00a0\nI always recommend to my customers to plan on the show starting 30 minutes after the start time of the party. This gives late-comers a chance to arrive before the show starts but also allows the children a chance to enjoy the show before they get too overwhelmed and wound up from other activities.\nAlways be sure that adults are present at the show and that those not watching the show are not in the same room talking and causing a distraction. I often get comments that the adults enjoyed the show as much as the kids and I know how much fun it is for parents to see their kids laughing and carrying on at a good comedy magic show. (And if the magician has technical chops, he can amaze the adults too!)\n\nIn addition:\nIf you have pets, secure them in another room or location before the entertainer arrives.\nRemove as many distractions from the room as possible. If you plan on giving out noisemakers of any kind, do so AFTER the show (please!) Have the payment ready immediately after the show\n\nBy taking a thoughtful approach to your birthday party planning, you will be able to select the right entertainment to meet your needs. Hopefully this guide will help you in your planning process and give you some ideas to make your child\u2019s party the talk of the neighborhood!\n\nThis is sponsored post courtesy of Steve-o Magic\n\nAbout the Author Steve \u201cSteve-o\u201d is a professional magician and family entertainer who performs his birthday party magic shows for kids of all ages throughout Louisville and surrounding areas.

        "text":"Most new ukuleles \u2014 particularly cheap ones \u2014 come with low-quality strings. Switch them for higher-quality ones and you\u2019ll be amazed at how much the sound improves. A decent set of strings costs $7 or $8, and the strings are worth much more for the amount of tone they add.\n\nLike ukuleles themselves, different strings have different sounds and appeal to different people. So try a few out and see which ones you prefer. Start by trying the string makers with the best reputation: Aquila and Worth.\n\nUnfortunately, with all the different sizes and tunings around, buying ukulele strings isn\u2019t a straightforward task. If you find yourself with the wrong set of strings, you certainly aren\u2019t going to be the first \u2014 everyone does it.\n\nThe first thing you want to check is the size of ukulele the strings are intended for. Soprano size strings work fine on a concert ukulele (and vice versa), but if you have a soprano instrument, avoid buying tenor or baritone strings \u2014 they won\u2019t fit on a soprano ukulele.\n\nNext, check that the strings aren\u2019t low-G tuning (unless of course you\u2019re looking for those specifically). Standard strings are sometimes marked high-G but not always. Sometimes you can see strings labeled aDF\u266fB (rather than gCEA), but in fact very little difference exists between the tunings, and so these strings work just as well in gCEA tuning. You may also see strings with the names written back to front (AECG or BF\u266fDA): very confusing, but these strings are exactly the same as the standard strings.\n\nMercifully, not all string issues are so vexing. Uke strings come in plenty of colors \u2014 black, white, transparent, brown, even pink \u2014 and they\u2019re all perfectly acceptable.\n\nDon\u2019t try to put steel strings on a standard ukulele. Steel strings have a lot of tension in them. Unless your uke is designed to take them, you\u2019re going to end up with a broken instrument.",

        "text":"Making a big purchase can feel a little daunting, especially if you\u2019re in the market for an unusual or specific item. In particular, shopping for record players can leave shoppers a little uneasy. Record players are not available everywhere anymore and they are highly specialized technical devices. You want something that suits your price range, plays sweet music, and fits into your space. The following will explore the different things you need to keep in mind when you\u2019re considering buying a record player.\n\nFigure Out Where You\u2019re Going To Keep It\n\nThere are slender, space-efficient record players available, but don\u2019t be fooled\u2014a record player requires some degree of space. Decide where you\u2019re going to keep your record player before you start shopping and devote a few minutes to measuring the space. There are some mighty record players available in the world\u2014it\u2019s best to figure out how big you can go before you start shopping.\n\nThink About Colour And Design\n\nWhile not the most important factor when looking into a record player, this is likely a purchase you\u2019re going to keep around for a while. Taking into consideration the color and design of the space around your record player will help you make your final decisions between your top three or four players. You want something that matches the vibe of your space\u2014something that doesn\u2019t stick out like a sore thumb. There are retro-design record players available, but also more modern styles to choose from.\n\nUnderstand Your Price Range\n\nThis is a big one. A record player can be the center of a room. It can provide you hours upon hours of joy. But if you\u2019re frustrated with yourself for overspending on it, you\u2019re not going to be able to enjoy it as much. Decide in advance how much you\u2019re willing to spend and stick to it. You\u2019ll have more fun with your record player if you don\u2019t regret buying it.\n\nConsider The Different Features You Want\n\nNowadays, record players come with many more features than in previous eras. Experts at emphasize that it is completely normal to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options for record players. You might find one that plays records, CDs, cassettes, digital music, and radio\u2014or a combination of some or all of these things. There are record players with speakers and a variety of ports (USB, headphones\u2026etc). Think about how you most commonly ingest music and make sure that the players you are looking at work with how you listen to music.\n\nSound Quality\n\nWe saved the big one for the end. Of course, when choosing a record player you want something that produces high-quality sound. To better determine this, make sure that you pay attention to online reviews for the different record players you are considering. It might also be worth watching some video reviews\u2014often the reviewers play music from the players in the video so you will be able to gain a tangible understanding of the sound that each player produces.\n\nBeyond this, if you ultimately decide to go with a record player with digital music features, make sure to take some time to figure out the best settings for sound quality. Different devices require different preferences enabled for optimal sound quality. It only takes a few moments of online research to discover how to alter the preferences of different digital music players to suit your new record player. You might be surprised to learn how much better things can sound.\n\nTake Your Time\n\nWhen we\u2019re about to make new purchases, many of us are excited to have our shiny new thing at home. Fight the urge to buy the first player that seems to meet your needs. Make sure you have an understanding of what\u2019s available to you before you decide. Besides, you might discover that a different retailer offers the player you wanted for a better price anyway. There\u2019s never anything wrong with taking your time to make a decision, especially one that involves the purchase of an item you plan on keeping around long-term.\n\nWith the above tips kept in mind, you are well on your way to choosing the best record player for you and your music listening needs. When you bring your new player home, be sure to be considerate of your neighbors and keep the volume at a reasonable level in the evenings\u2014we know it can be tempting to turn something up full blast. As well, if you\u2019re shopping for a shared home, it never hurts to ask the other people you live with which design they prefer.\n\nWritten by Stop The Breaks\nStop The Breaks is an independent music marketing company focused on showcasing independent hip-hop artists.

        "text":"Music Video Budgets: Where your Money is Spent\n\n  \u2022 Andy Woodruff\n  \u2022 28 Oct, 2016\n\nMusic Videos are definitely a worthy investment if you are looking to take your musical career to the next level. But what will your money be spent on? Here's what you should know...\n\nWe are often asked to provide a break down of costs for how a music video budget will be spent. Of course no two videos are the same, but there are some common areas where time and effort has to be spent.\n\nThis short article sets out the key areas and reasons why budgets can vary so much.\n\nProject Planning \u00a0\n\nAny video production is broken down into three distinct stages. Within each stage there will be areas of cost that will always exist regardless of the type of music video made.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Pre-production (Producing) \u2013 which includes planning, finding locations, casting actors, picking crew, and booking equipment. Without this essential effort the filming day won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Production (Shooting) - crew, cast, lights, equipment, locations, transport. The filming day is everything.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Post-production (Editing) - editing, colour grading, video exports (different versions for different channels). This is when all the components are brought to one place to be weaved into the final video. \u00a0\n\nThese three paragraphs barely cover what is involved. Even a simple half-day shoot with a self-shooting director and assistant will need a lot of planning, a location and editing.\n\nMost of the film budget will be spent on the crew.\n\nFollowing is a list of the key roles. That isn\u2019t to say all of them will be required on your shoot, but they might. If budget is tight crew members will double up on roles if they have the skill sets and sometimes even if they don\u2019t.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Director - It is the director who will be masterminding the project, creating the idea and bringing it to life. Before filming starts only they will know what the finished video will look like. Meet our inhouse Directors, here.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01st Assistant Director (1st AD) \u2013 supports the director and helps make their job easier.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Director of Photography (DOP) \u2013 responsible for the visual look and feel and by specifying camera, lenses, lights, and other specialised equipment.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01st Assistant Camera (1st AC) \u2013 supports the DOP and can be a camera operator or a focus puller\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Gaffer \/ Spark \u2013 supports the DOP, with lighting and safe power distribution\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Visual Effects Supervisor \u2013 Responsible for the filming and application of VFX\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Self-shooting Director\/DOP\/Camera Op \u2013 On lower budget shoots you will often get a Camera Owner\/Operator who knows how to set the lights. Typically they will be restricted in what they can offer, not through a lack of skill-set but because of time and money\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Art Director \u2013 their responsibility can range from designing sets, to sourcing props, making props and adapting them for filming.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Hair & Make Up Artist \u2013 these are two distinct roles and are combined only because their responsibilities are broadly the same: to find the right look and feel to reflect the directors chosen look. It is worth bearing in mind that these crew members, often in the background, will spend more time with the artists than anyone else.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Stylist \/ Wardrobe \u2013 just like it ever was; how you look counts in music videos. From studied casualness to bang on the money zeitgeist fashion, it matters!\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Production Assistant \u2013 their role is to support the shoot as required with a particular eye on the external elements of the shoot \u2013 getting crew about the place, making sure kit is where it should be. \u00a0\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all...\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Talent \u2013 If the treatment includes acted scenes or a choreographed dance scene you\u2019ll have to recruit your talent and rehearse them beforehand.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Location \u2013 Studios or External. Outdoor shoots are the riskiest. What do you do if it rains and you have a swimwear scene lined up? Obviously you try and ship off to the Caribbean or such like, but in the real world you don\u2019t shoot summer scenes in the winter.\n\nStudio shoots or internal location shoots can be a lot more controlled and for that reason have a lot to commend them.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Equipment \u2013 it\u2019s true that crew can consume a lot of the budget. It\u2019s also true about equipment. The following list is not exhaustive but gives a sense of what can be involved.\n\n\u00a0-> Choice of Camera & Lens, e.g DSLR v Red\/Arri\/4K.\nThe camera of choice for many low budgets music videos has been the Canon 5D, a DSLR camera that captures video good enough for YouTube. There are some spectacular examples of DSLR filmed videos Dodie: Coke TV. You can operate one of these with a crew as small as two people.\n\nIn comparison a Red or Arri Camera is inherently more expensive. It will require at least a three person team to operate it efficiently. They cost a lot more to hire plus lenses and other accessories are more expensive.\n\nA Red or Arri with prime lenses can easily add \u00a31-2K to the budget. We compare the two, here.\n\n\u00a0-> Lights, Smoke Machines, Revolving Platforms etc \u00a0\nJust like camera\u2019s, kit hire can run on and on. It is often a temptation to over order kit and equipment to ensure every possibility is catered for.\n\nPost Production\n\nMost people will know this as the edit. It comprises of a number of tasks.\n\nFirstly the footage has to be backed up, logged, named and organised ready for editing.\n\nThe edit can consist of an assembly edit, 1st edit to show the client, complete edit and finally colour graded edit (which is basically the final edit).\n\nColour grading is like \u2018photoshopping\u2019 \u2013 colours and tones are adjusted within the editing software to get a specific \u2018look\u2019 that the video was lit and filmed for.\n\nIf there are any special effects to be built into the video it usually happens before the complete edit.\n\nThis screenshot of a video in edit shows how complicated they can be \u2013 it almost looks like a version of a musical score\n\nediting screenshot\n\nAfter the process of review and amendment the video is finished. All that remains to be done is to create different formats of the video for the different places where the video will be shown. These days that mainly means the Internet: YouTube, Facebook etc, but if you want a version to be shown on an outdoor display 20 feet across then you will need a differently optimised version.\n\nThe Production Company Point of View.\n\nOne thing every artist, band, manager or record label should know is that with music videos most of the budget goes into the production. In our experience this is more the case than any other form of branded content and applies whether the budget is small or generous. \u00a0\n\nWhy is this? Simple really, these are talented and professional creative\u2019s who want to make the best film they can. Music videos are notoriously under funded, but an opportunity to create something personal and real is still interesting\n\nThere is a quid pro quo. You will always get a better bang for your buck if you allow the Director and their team get on with what they do best. If you do they will always go that extra step.\n\nWhat really matters!\n\nThe best videos we\u2019ve made have been because the director and the artist have had a meeting of minds. Trust has been implicit from the outset.\n\nIt has to be this way because you can\u2019t make art by committee. (Actually you can, but it will cost you a lot more and it won\u2019t be as good \u2013 but that is another article for another day.)\n\nWritten by Andy Woodruff\n\nLast modified on Thursday, 12 January 2017 12:42\nRate this item\n(2 votes)\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\n\nCall 020 3286 3745\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

        "text":"Thrash Course with Revocation's Dave Davidson: The Advantages of Alternate Picking, and How I Play \u201cThe Hive,\u201d Part 2\n\nPublish date:\nSocial count:\n\nLast month, I demonstrated the primary riffs that I play in \u201cThe Hive,\u201d the opening track on Revocation\u2019s new, self-titled release.\n\nAs I explained, the song\u2019s opening licks are executed using fast consecutive downstrokes, and I also perform tremolo picking.\n\nThis month, I\u2019d like to cover some of the song\u2019s other primary riffs, which, conversely, are all performed with alternate (down-up) picking, combined once again with some super-fast tremolo picking.\n\nFigure 1 represents the bridge riff to \u201cThe Hive.\u201d The passage is played in 3\/4 meter and is based on the E symmetrical diminished scale (E F G Gs Bf B Cs D), which is somewhat similar to the E whole-tone scale (E Fs Gs Bf C D). While applying a light palm mute (P.M.) throughout\u2014lightly resting the edge of my pick-hand palm across the strings next to the bridge saddles\u2014I begin with a downstroke on the open low E note and proceed to alternate pick the remainder of the lick, picking the Bf with an upstroke. The riff is comprised of a two-bar pattern played twice, after which the first bar is repeated, followed by a lick in bar 6 that is slightly different than bar 2 in that it steadily descends through the E whole-tone scale. I love the weird, mysterious quality of the symmetrical diminished scale, whose minor and major thirds\u2014G and Gs, respectively\u2014and diminished, or \u201cflatted,\u201d fifth, Bf, lend a warped harmonic sensibility to its sound.\n\nThis riff is followed by the pattern shown in Figure 2. This second riff is played exactly the same way in bar 1, but in bar 2 I switch from single notes to two-note dyads\u2014E and Gs\u2014accented on upbeats. This two-bar riff is played twice, then I modulate down two whole steps, beginning on Fs, and play a nearly identical motif but as single notes, using the open low E string for the upbeat accents. Alternate picking is used to execute this riff as well.\n\nThe song\u2019s final theme is a permutation of the opening lick, wherein chromatic notes on the fifth and fourth strings alternate with low repeated pedal tones, but here the lick is played in 3\/4 time, as illustrated in Figure 3. Using alternate picking exclusively, I play chromatically ascending notes on the fifth string with upstrokes, while the low root notes on the sixth string are down-picked, after which the fret hand moves up one fret and the low sixth-string root note alternates with chromatically descending notes on the fourth string. This four-bar pattern is played four times, then I switch to tremolo picking the chromatically ascending and descending notes on the fifth and fourth strings. After that four-bar phrase is played twice, I return to the opening four-bar figure.\n\nTo me, the most challenging aspect of this lick is the tremolo picking, so I recommend working with a metronome. Start out slowly at first, and then gradually build up speed until you can tremolo pick these lines smoothly and cleanly at 225 beats per minute.",

        "text":"Tips & Techniques - September 1993\n\nAnd The Winner Is...\n\nfrom Kathy Morgan, Production Director,\u00a0WKMQ-FM\/WNTA-AM, Rockford, IL\n\nLooking for a new way to spark creativity among your production staff? Something to give recognition to those who go \"above and beyond the call of the 4-track?\" Ladies and gentlemen of the Production Manor, I give you the Golden Reel.\n\nThe premise is simple. A traveling award that recognizes the most original\/effective\/outstanding production done in-house. Make it fun. We actually had an old take-up reel painted and mounted on a trophy. The trophy has a changeable name plate for the winner, with nameplates of all the producers ready. Pretty campy, but it has an offbeat sort of charm.\n\nCome up with whatever guidelines you think are appropriate to your own situation. Ours are pretty general -- any piece of production can be nominated, from specs to actual spots to special features and new capsules to promos and imagers. Anyone can nominate -- a sales rep who wants to recognize a sale-closing spec, for instance, or the jock who spent all night working on a killer contest promo. We've found that anonymous nominations lead to more entries.\n\nGet the GM to spring for some worthwhile prizes -- maybe a weekend at the local resort trade, or dinner for two at the classy client restaurant. Don't forget -- cash works nicely, too!\n\nDecide on your frequency and judging criteria. We have a \"secret\" panel that listens to the nominees and picks a winner each month. The panel changes each time, and is made up of representatives from each area of the station: engineering, sales, production, programming, news, etc..\n\nYou'll be surprised at how some people will get into the competition. It has given some of our lesser experienced jocks something to experiment and reach for, and brought a little fun back for some of the \"old pros\" who were getting caught in a rut. We've even had weekenders spend extra time in the studio on their own to have something to submit! The quality of production has jumped to an even higher notch as everyone keeps an ear out for \"The Reel.\"\n\nAnother subtle benefit has been the interest the contest generates among other areas of the station. Everyone wants to judge, and the judges really pay attention and listen closely. It gives them a better idea of what goes on down below the stairs in our \"production cave.\" They come away with a new respect for the producers and copywriters.\n\nBest of all, it gives recognition and a sense of accomplishment to the winners, plus actual prize perks. Sure, for many of us -- especially in smaller markets -- production is part of the gig. And while we love what we do (or we wouldn't\/shouldn't be here), it's always great to hear that extra, \"way to go!\"\n\nGive it a try. Who knows, your Golden Reels might even lead to next year's Clio and Radio Mercury winners. And if you're really lucky, next year's RAP Awards!\u00a0\n\n\nTV In The Car\n\nfrom Steve Wilson, Production Director,\u00a0KNIN-AM\/FM, Wichita Falls, TX\n\nHere's a little tip I use from time to time. I passed this along to all the producers on staff, and it seems to work.\n\nIf you live in a market that broadcasts television audio on the FM band, try, for a week, to listen to the television in your car. Many times, when you watch television, you get wrapped up in the visual aspect of the medium. Find a time when they are running some \"real life\" drama (Cops works best for me) and just listen to the people. Hey! Wow! These people sound soooo real! No announcer voices, and no snappy lines. Just people using incorrect grammar, lots of \"ahhs\" and \"humms.\" You gotta love it!\n\nYou know from just the sound and delivery that these are real people. This is what people really sound like, relaxed and natural. It's real! Listen to the delivery, concentrating only on the audio portion of the television. Why do they sound different, so real?\n\nNow, after a week or so of this, go into the studio and act. Use your body. Clench your teeth. Double over with laughter. Jump up and down. Act it out! When you listen to \"real life\" television, you can tell when someone smiles. You can tell when someone is uptight or angry. You can tell these things from the voice. We all do it every day. The whole trick of it is to fake it when you need it! Feel it, and you can hear it!\n\nComments (0)\n\nThere are no comments posted here yet\n\nLeave your comments\n\n  1. Posting comment as a guest.

        "text":"Gary Moore \u2013 Cold Day In Hell\n\nFiled in G , M 0 comments\n\nGary Moore Cold Day In Hell TabAs far as scorching blues guitar playing is concerned, everyone needs Moore. Gary\u2019s seriously rock vibrato and consummate blues phrasing will take a fair amount of technique to master. Having gone through many years as a rock player, Gary employs a take-no-prisoners approach to both tone and attack \u2013 so be prepared to give your guitar a fairly rough ride while studying this piece! Gary has gone through some changes in the kind of equipment he chooses over the years and so we can\u2019t be absolutely sure which gear he chose for these sessions. We can guess, of course, and ears tell me that the original track sounds like a Les Paul\/Marshall Bluesbreaker combination.\n\nIn an interview he said that he played through the clean channel of a Soldano amp, using an old Marshall Guv\u2019nor pedal for overdrive. But I\u2019m pretty confident that you can get somewhere in the right area with a humbucker-loaded guitar and an amp with some extra balls.\n\nOne thing that becomes immediately apparent when you listen to this track is Gary\u2019s rather extreme vibrato technique. This might be a hangover from his rock period, too: it\u2019s very deep and fast, which is perhaps slightly uncharacteristic for a blueser, but there you have it. The only way to master this kind of heavy vibrato is to sit and practise it methodically. Try a few practice bends and push the vibrato to extremes. After a while it will start to feel a bit more natural, but it will probably take a while to get completely up and running. Be patient!\n\nAnother couple of techniques to watch out for during the solo are a spot of palm muting and the pinched harmonics that almost immediately follow it. These definitely betray Mr Moore as an ex-rocker!\n\nCold Day In Hell. Scaling the fretboard\n\nScale-wise, we\u2019re in the very familiar blues pentatonic area throughout \u2013 one that you should be familiar with in all positions. It\u2019s always worth taking a few runs at random from a transcription like this and seeing exactly what a player does with an apparently limited series of notes. What you hear is style and phrasing \u2013 both of which have to be learned along with the very basic ideas about which notes are being played where.\n\nIf we take a look at what\u2019s going on with Gary\u2019s right hand, you can probably hear that his pick attack is relatively \u2018heavy\u2019. This adds to the overall aggressive feel of\u2019 Cold Day In Hell\u2019 significantly and can be achieved by using a heavy pick and considerable welly. It\u2019s always a good idea to hear how your guitar responds to different levels of pick attack \u2013 and it\u2019s a simple enough experiment. All you have to do is fret a note and see how much of a dynamic range you can muster. Start off picking as softly as possible and then bring it up in stages to see how much energy you can put into the string. You\u2019ll find that it has quite a dramatic effect on your tone.\n\nLead Guitar:\n\nCold Day In Hell Sound Adivce Lead Guitar\n\nRhythm Guitar:\n\nCold Day In Hell Sound Advice Rhythm Guitar\n\n\n\nGary Moore Cold Day In Hell Guitar Tab\n\nIt\u2019s just a part of\u00a0Gary Moore Cold Day In Hell guitar tab and music sheet.\n\nThrough the link below you can download a full transcription of\n\nGary Moore Cold Day In Hell\u00a0with backing track\n\n\n15 November 2012 0 comments\nTags : ,\n\n\nNo comments yet.
