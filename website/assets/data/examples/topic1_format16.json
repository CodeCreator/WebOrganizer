        "text":"Article Number: 3112\nMagazine, English, Staple Binding, 16 Pages, 2012\nEric Baudelaire\n\nThe Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao, Adachi and 27 Years without images\n\n\u20ac 10.00\n\nThis libretto is part of an installation by Eric Baudelaire titled \"The Anabasis of May and Fusako Shigenobu, Masao, Adachi and 27 Years without images\".\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s most recent work looks at the complexities of recounting the history of the Japanese Red Army (JRA) \u2013 a radical group that emerged from the 1968 Tokyo student movement, settled in Beirut in the early 1970s, and engaged in sophisticated terrorist activities in solidarity with the Palestinian cause.\n\nThe exhibition consists of an installation encompassing his 2011 experimental documentary film of the same name, which centres upon the oral testimonies of two JRA protagonists: May Shigenobu, the daughter of JRA founder and leader Fusako Shigenobu, and Masao Adachi, a legendary underground film director, JRA member and theoretician. This is shown alongside documents, photographs, prison drawings and works on paper that further contextualise the JRA's radical journey, focusing on issues of representation associated with documentary, testimony and the production or absence of images. The Anabasis... engages with questions concerning the relationship between politics and film, and militant filmmaking versus activism without cinema \u2013 a distinction that Masao Adachi refuses, but that Baudelaire\u2019s exhibition interrogates anew.\n\nBaudelaire frames the story of the JRA in a literary tradition going back to Xenophon\u2019s Anabasis: a journey of soldiers lost in foreign lands, wandering into the unknown on a circuitous journey home. In recounting their own journeys, May Shigenobu and Masao Adachi weave together intimate stories, political history, revolutionary propaganda and film theory. They each describe clandestine and imageless experiences in which images are nonetheless constantly at stake. May Shigenobu, for instance, spent much of her early life in hiding, often living under pseudonyms. When family snapshots were occasionally taken they were always then hastily destroyed. As she grew older, returned to Japan and started working as a television journalist, images began to provide her with a new means of self-invention.\n\nAs a filmmaker, Adachi devoted his life to images. During his years in Lebanon, he sought to advance his radical film practice by trading the camera for the rifle. Yet all the while he remained a filmmaker at heart, even conceiving of JRA aeroplane highjackings as screenplays. The scenarios were his own, the actors were JRA fighters, but the cinematography was left to the news cameras.\n\nMay Shigenobu\u2019s and Masao Adachi\u2019s stories unfold over new 'f\u00fbkeiron' Super 8 images filmed by Baudelaire in Tokyo and Beirut. F\u00fbkeiron is a 'theory of landscape' developed by Adachi for his 1969 film AKA Serial Killer, an excerpt of which is also included in the exhibition. Through filming landscapes, he sought to reveal the structures of oppression that underpin the political system and cause alienation. The Anabasis... puts this theory to work and also turns it back towards its author, exploring the problematic overlaps between images of reality and those of fiction, and between a radical political engagement and an unsettling fascination with violence.\n\nLanguage: English\/French",

        "text":"Back to Projects\n\nMolloy College - Campus Center\n\nBRB Architects has completed the 57,000 sf campus center and associated main quadrangle at Molloy College, Rockville Centre, New York. Intended to be the centerpiece of the College\u2019s transformation from a commuter college to a 24 hour learning community, the \u201cPublic Square\u201d will support student life with spaces such as a caf\u00e9, lounges, study rooms, student club space, a data center, a bookstore and an art gallery. In addition, the center houses a 575 seat theater, as well as rehearsal and office spaces for the music department.\n\nThe 57,000 \u201cPublic Square\u201d creates and frames a central campus quadrangle. A caf\u00e9, lounge, and study space are located on the east side of the building, overlooking the quadrangle through the largely-glazed east face of the building. The indoor spaces are an extension of the quadrangle, together creating a vibrant center for student life at Molloy.\n\nThe building is organized as a series of three layers separated by open-ended circulation spines which allow visual connection to the Molloy Campus. The masonry-clad westernmost layer houses support spaces and enclosed offices. The loft-like central layer of the building with its exposed steel structure is designed for maximum flexibility. This zone contains larger spaces such as the multi-purpose space, the art gallery, student club workrooms, and the information commons, a technologically-enabled space. This open zone is punctuated by a large sky lit atrium, connecting spaces vertically and creating a vibrant bustle throughout the building. The glass and zinc clad easternmost layer of the building acts as a veranda, visually connecting lounge and study spaces to the outdoor quadrangle. Through the use of sand cast red brick, oak doors, and a warm natural color palette, the building maintains a strong connection to the existing campus fabric.\n\nThe Project is LEED Certified.",

Unless, of course, average can be defined as hedonistic, sun-drenched, and beachside. Draped across a vintage car or an unmade bed, rolling in the sand, or standing waist-high in an endless ocean, the subjects of Purienne\u2019s photographs convey a sexuality that\u2019s as nostalgic as it is au courant, at once innocent and sultry. The founder of Mirage magazine, Purienne always seems to have his camera pointed away from real life and toward a fantasy of beautiful girls with nothing on their minds but fun, and even less on their bodies. Paging through these stunning photographs, however, readers will appreciate Purienne\u2019s adroit staging and composition, ingenious use of light, and impeccable styling\u2014all the skills that have made him one of today\u2019s most sought-after fashion photographers.\n\nOrdering Information\nThis item is currently unavailable from photo-eye, however we have located copies for you to purchase immediately through Amazon Marketplace.
