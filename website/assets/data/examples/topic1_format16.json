        "text":"Identity + Refuge - Silk foulard jacket\n\nStudio Orta - 0446\n\nDate: 1995\nRef: 0446\nMaterials: Suede and silk carr\u00e9\nCatalogued: Lucy Orta, Phaidon Press, 2002, pp 8-15\nExhibition history: 2010 CCANW, UK; 2008 Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art,Japan; 2009 Plymouth Arts Centre, UK; 1998 Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney, Australia; 1996 Dietch Projects New York, USA ; 1995 Salvation Army Paris, France\nCourtesy: Lucy + Jorge Orta\n\nIdentity + Refuge is a co-creation workshop conducted together with residents of the Cit\u00e9 de Refuge, Salvation Army homeless shelter in Paris. The shelter\u2019s storeroom housed a surplus of clothing and accessories, which Lucy Orta chose as a raw material to transform into new garments. Her initial idea was to co-create a tailor-made wardrobe for residents who otherwise had no choice but to salvage second-hand clothing for their own use. Over the course of the months, the workshop changed course and they began making clothes for imaginary wearers, with the help of fashion students. The workshop concluded with a public fashion show in the thrift store of the Cit\u00e9 de Refuge, mobilising all the staff and residents.\u00a0\n\nOne of the aims of the Identity + Refuge workshop was to give residents the means to reclaim their self-esteem through the items they wore, giving them the capacity to create a wardrobe that they regarded as comfortable, appropriate and even fashionable. Through the analysis of the morphology of an abandoned garment, through to its transformation into something useful, Orta encouraged the residents to reconsider their appearance and their individual roles in society, which she hoped would boost their self-esteem and help shape personal identity. The collective task also transmitted a message about human creativity: the reclained garments made by the residents resulted from their own creative inspiration that they may not have realized existed previously. Performed with the tools and materials at hand rather than through mechanized production, the task of making the garments also constituted the sort of work-oriented creativity that L\u00e9vi-Strauss identified as \u2018bricolage'.\u00a0\n\n\"Bricolage identifies the \u201cevents\u201d that result when basic materials are transformed into more refined products, which in this case proved to be both the workshop established to convert rags into beautiful clothing and the self-awareness created among the residents. L\u00e9vi-Strauss argued that \u201cto understand a real object in its totality we always tend to work from its parts,\u201d identifying art in the spaces between creative production and technical skill. The concept of \u201cart in the spaces\u201d is a perfect metaphor for Orta\u2019s interventions, which in this context revealed parallels between the new lease of life given to the abandoned clothing and the new lease of hope experienced by the residents. These recycled objects are unique in their capacity to reveal much about the social conditions that necessitated their production in the first place.\" Bradley Quinn",

The building houses the dance studio, along with storage and dressing rooms.\n\n\nBuilding elements separated: fabric canopy, roof framing, building structure and w enclosing walls\n\nThe design addresses the need for a large, clear-span space within the constraints of a very modest budget. The building design stems from the structural solution. Four steel-tube columns are cantilevered from below grade to support the roof framing. Extending 25 feet below grade and tied together with grade beams below the floor slab, these four columns resist the lateral forces acting on the building and support the light weight framing over which a fabric roof is stretched. The overall lightness of the building is key to the success of the solution.\n\nThe walls are a combination of an insulated rain screen system, utilizing resin treated plywood panels on the exterior, and a dual glazed storefront system. Operable window units glazed into the storefront system permit natural ventilation, which would be effective for a significant portion of the year given, the campuses coastal zone location.\n\nThe interior faces of the walls are mirrored or are equipped with ballet bars (as required). The dance studio is equipped with a sprung floor. Lighting is supported by the horizontal tie members of the roof structure, as are the fire sprinklers, acoustical panels, and air-conditioning ducts. The air-conditioning equipment is mounted on the ground at one of the narrow ends of the building.\n\nThe building is rotated on the site so as to not be parallel to the adjacent building walls or street. This strategy creates more reasonable gathering spaces, animating the activity around the pavilion.\n\n\nPin It on Pinterest\n\nShare This",

New technology, with Smartphones, Tablets, self driving cars and packages delivered by drones, is bringing progress everywhere. Better and cheaper nutrition is increasing life expectancy and overall the world\u2019s nations are becoming more democratic. But is that really how the world is? Are there not losers as well as winners? Isn\u2019t it really in the end the same old story as throughout human history?\n\nRoland Willaert, a European and a traveller, takes as his subject the losers of our contemporary world. The streets and its people are the actors and the inspiration of his work. Wherever he finds himself he is a photographer of the city.\n\nTo capture the life and energy of the streets in a small, inevitably partial, photographic extract is a work of great concentration. For me it is about being able to sense that the right moment may be about to happen when I can capture something special and, if it should then really happen, succeeding in capturing it. From the great mass of human and visual stimulation I try to find what can make us think again, perhaps in its simplicity, in its abstraction, in its humanity.\u201d Roland Willaert\n\nPart of the Monat der Fotografie OFF Berlin 2016.\nDiscover more Festival highlights on PiB under the tag #MdF OFF Berlin 2016!\n\nTeil des Monat der Fotografie OFF Berlin 2016.\nEntdecke weitere Festival-Highlights auf FiB unter dem Tag #MdF OFF Berlin 2016!\n\nEvent Details\n\nGalerie Emma-T - Roland Willaert - Eine ungerechte Fallhoehe, Invitation 1\nLehderstra\u00dfe 60, 13086 Berlin, Germany",

This work is not about surfaces but understanding\u2026\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGeorgina Coburn",
