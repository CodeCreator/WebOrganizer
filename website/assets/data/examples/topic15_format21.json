        "text":"Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA\n\nElectrocution: Work Safely with Cranes Near Power Lines | Transcript\n\nIn the U.S., hundreds of construction workers die every year while on the job, with over 700 fatalities just in the year 2011. The third leading cause of these deaths is electrocution. Electrocutions cause one of every ten construction worker deaths, with nearly 70 deaths in 2011. But these deaths can be prevented. The video you are about to see shows how quickly contact with overhead power lines can result in the electrocution of a worker. The video will also show what employers must do to ensure that the work can be done more safely. Employers have a responsibility to provide a safe workplace and protect workers against possible hazards. You'll see that training workers, pre-job planning and taking the right precautions save lives. Please be advised. The scenes you are about to see deal with deaths at construction sites and may be disturbing to some people. All scenes are based on actual events.\n\nTwo construction workers were replacing a section of pipe in a trench next to a road. They were using a crane to unload the pipe from a truck and place it on the ground close to the trench. While one worker operated the crane, another worker was on the ground to help direct the pipe toward the ground near the trench. The worker directing the pipe had one hand on the tagline, which was attached to the rigging used to lift the load. As the crane operator began to move the pipe, the crane's boom contacted an overhead power line. The electrical current traveled through the boom, down the load line, along the tagline, and reached the worker. He died instantly.\n\nLet's look at the events leading up to this tragic incident, and see how it could have been prevented. The worksite did not have many of the required controls in place to protect workers from overhead power line hazards. For instance, before the work started, the employer had not set up the required clearance distance to keep the crane a safe distance from the overhead power line.\n\nLet's take a look at the same work area, this time with proper precautions in place. All workers are trained, this includes the crane operator being certified and the rigger and spotter fully qualified. Because the line is \"live\" (or energized), the employer has taken steps to keep a safe distance from the power line: The foreman obtained the voltage of the overhead power line from the utility company. Based on the voltage, he determined the minimum required distance of the crane from the power line. A pre-job safety planning meeting was held. Flags are set up to show the boundary that must not be crossed. A non-conductive tag line is used to control the movement of the pipes. The truck is no longer directly below the power line. And a spotter is on site with a two-way radio to communicate with the operator.Higher voltage lines will require greater minimum safe distances and additional precautions than those shown here. Now, as the pipe is moved, the boom remains a safe distance from the power lines and the worker safely guides the pipe towards the ground near the trench.\n\nThis video shows one of several options employers can use to keep workers safe when operating cranes near power lines. Not all worksites are the same, and the precautions could be different than those shown here. Construction deaths from electrocutions are preventable. The precautions shown here save workers' lives. Follow safe crane operation requirements on the job: it could be the difference between life and death.\n\nIf you would like more information, contact OSHA at www.osha.gov or 1-800-321-OSHA that's 1-800-321-6742.\n\nBack to Top\n\nThank You for Visiting Our Website\n\nYou are exiting the Department of Labor's Web server.\n\nThe Department of Labor does not endorse, takes no responsibility for, and exercises no control over the linked organization or its views, or contents, nor does it vouch for the accuracy or accessibility of the information contained on the destination server.

        "text":"Dr. Prepper\nNo. 2\n\nDr. Prepper _Tom Swan MTEST\nHome > Service & support > Dr. Prepper Academy > Dr. Prepper No. 2\n\nDr. Prepper\u2019s special guest: Tom Swan from MTEST\n\nCommon myths about salts, chlorides and coatings\n\nDr. Prepper regularly invites surface preparation, coating and corrosion protection specialists to share their knowledge and experience. In this edition, meet Tom Swan, General Manager of MTEST (MontiPower\u2013Test Equipment & Specialty Tool), located in Houston, Texas.\n\nTom has led MTEST since its inception in 2009 and has many years of experience working with coatings, corrosion control and integritiy management. He is a recognized industry leader and expert on testing and inspection equipment.\n\nTom is a member of the Houston Coating Society, SSPC and NACE and highly appreciated in the Houston area and beyond for his knowledge and sensible advice.\n\nToday, Tom will share with us his thoughts on certain popular beliefs \u2013 aka common myths \u2013 concerning salts, chlorides and coatings.\n\nThe regular RED PAPER from MontiPower\u00ae. Full of nice to know \u2013 and need to know \u2013 facts about the most optimal surface preparation since 1987.\n\nDr. Pepper _ True, misleading or false?\n\nA lot has been written about salts and chlorides over the years. Much of it is true, sometimes it\u2019s misleading, but sometime it\u2019s just downright false.\nToday Tom and Dr. Prepper will cut through the marketing hype to sort out fact vs. fiction and share the truth.\n\n\nLook beyond the marketing to separate fact from fiction.\n\n\nDR. PREPPER: \u201cTom, you mentioned many articles and specifications interchange the term \u201csalt\u201d and \u201cchloride\u201d. Why is that an issue?\u201d\n\nTOM: While most of the salts on metal or concrete surfaces are generally chloride salts, not all salts contain chloride. In the field, the only way to determine \u201csalt\u201d is to measure conductivity and approximate the total salts or total dissolved solids (TDS). The only way to measure the chloride anion is to use a chloride-specific test.\nTo determine which test is best for a project, we need to understand the specific concern of \u201cinvisible surface contaminants\u201d.\n\nWhat constitutes a Salt?\n\nDR. PREPPER: \u201cWhat is the difference between a Chloride and a salt, Tom?\u201d\n\nTOM: Well, the first step is to understand what constitutes a salt. Salts are often referred to as molecules. The fact is, salts are not actually molecules, but should really be called \u201cformula units\u201d. This makes sense if we look at the lattice structure of a salt crystal.\nLet\u2019s examine a sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal (Figure 1).\n\n(Figure 1)\n\nFigure 1 shows that each chloride ion is bound to four (six for face-centered cubic lattice) sodium ions by strong electrostatic charges called ionic bonds. Each sodium ion is also bound to four other chloride ions by ionic bonds.\n\nSince no single ion is attached to any other ion, this is not a molecule but a lattice of 1 chloride anion (Cl\u2013) to 1 sodium cation (Na+) or NaCl. Salts are typically composed of a metal atom (cation) and a non-metal atom (anion) joined by ionic bonds. Other salts contain two non-metal atoms (ammonium chloride [Na4Cl]) or two metal atoms (calcium plumbate [CaO3Pb]).\n\nBad salt vs Good salt\n\nDR. PREPPER: \u201cOur industry has been flooded with articles on chloride and salts that suggest some are worse than others when it comes to osmotic blistering (e.g., chloride, sulfate, and nitrate are bad).\nCan you break down a few terms used in those articles,\u00a0 Tom?\u201d\n\nTOM: Sure thing.\n\n\n  \u2022 A solution is composed of a solvent and a solute. For present purposes, the solvent is water and the solute is the substance on the surface under the paint that is water soluble.\n\n\n  \u2022 This is a colligative property of solutions that depends on the number of particles or ions in a given volume of solvent, not on the mass or type of the particles or ions.\n  \u2022 Osmosis is independent of the chemical nature of the solute, but very dependent on the solvent. What is dissolved can be ions, solvents, or organics such as sugar.\n\nOsmotic Pressure\n\n  \u2022 Osmotic pressure depends on the number of dissolved particles or ions, not the chemical nature of the solute.\n  \u2022 So, the type of solute is not important. On the other hand, the type of solvent is important. This will be described in greater detail below.\n\nDr. Prepper\n\nSo let\u2019s examine 5 common myths or popular beliefs in our industry that we hear repeated often.\n\nMyth #1: \u2018Chloride salts pull water through membranes\u2019\n\nMany industry articles suggest some salts containing chloride anions are hygroscopic, and are, therefore, worse than others in terms of inciting osmotic blisters. According to the myth, the hygroscopic chloride anion, generally in the form of NaCl, pulls water through the coating causing an osmotic cell to grow.\n\nThe truth is that chloride salts don\u2019t pull water through the coating. The solution on one side of the coating cannot directly detect what is on the other side unless there is a breach or hole in the coating. Moreover, the salt normally cited as a problem, NaCl, is not particularly hygroscopic when compared to many other salts.\n\nThe miraculous behaviour of water molecules\n\nA coating is considered semipermeable, which means it will let small molecules (water) pass through, but will not allow larger molecules (anions and cations) to pass through. When water is on the surface of the coating, small amounts migrate through the coating as individual molecules. When these molecules reach the substrate underneath the coating, if the surface is clean, the molecules of water continue on their way. When the water reaches the surface, if it encounters soluble salts, the water will dissolve any soluble salts or other water-soluble materials to form a solution.\n\nThe dissolved particles lower the vapor pressure of the solution which prevents the liquid from leaving the solution and creates a driving force (osmotic pressure) from the side with higher vapor pressure (the liquid outside the coating) toward the side with the lower vapor pressure (the solution beneath the coating). Osmotic pressure is determined by the relationship of the two solutions separated by the semipermeable membrane (the coating).\n\nSo Tom, you\u2019re saying that the number of ions in the solution, or molar concentration, determines what the osmotic pressure is, not the composition of ions?\n\nTOM: That\u2019s right, Dr. Prepper. Soluble salt ions such as Na+ and Cl- or soluble organics such as sugars or solvents. 1-3 The important thing to note is: the solute which is dissolved has no bearing on osmosis. It does not even have to be a salt. Again, what matters is the number of particles that are dissolved. The osmotic theory that treats this blistering of the coatings is true only at extreme dilution, so the theory is valid for this discussion.\n\nWhile the nature of the solute has no bearing on osmosis, it does have a bearing on the creation of a corrosion cell. If the solute is ionic, the liquid under the coating will be an electrolyte and will form a corrosion cell. The solute that is dissolved will affect the strength of the corrosion cell. If salts present in the solution render the pH acidic, the corrosion cell will be more corrosive than if the solution is basic.\n\nMyth #2: \u2018Chemical Additives are Necessary to Remove Water-Soluble Salts\u2019\n\nDR. PREPPER: This leads into my next question. We often hear in our industry that the only way to completely remove water-soluble salts is with chemical additives. This popular belief leads us into a discussion of the role of chemicals in reducing water-soluble salts or chloride contamination.\n\nIn most situations the use of high-pressure water is sufficient to remove salts to a level low enough to meet the extraction criterion. It is important to use good-quality water to prevent further contamination of the surface. Most potable water is acceptable, generally firewater or sea water is not. The objective is to have the surface meet the extraction criterion at the end of the wash cycle.\n\nPressurized water cleans a surface better than just pouring a bucket of water over it.\n\nThe energy imparted to pressurized water helps break the surface tension of the water so that it more effectively wets the surface. Typically, higher purity water will dissolve more salts. Adding a surfactant (rinse aid) the wash water can increase its efficiency the same way that adding soap to a dishwasher helps clean the dishes.\n\nAs the wash water quality decreases, or the surface is corroded or pitted, surface cleaners (rinse aids) can help remove the salts. However, if the wash water is too contaminated, not even the presence of the chemicals will help clean the surface. In some cases, if the wrong cleaner is used, they may even increase the contamination. After washing, the surface should be tested to measure the amounts of salts on it.\n\nAll cleaners work generally in the same way\n\n\nTOM: To remove the salts, the solvent (water) needs to reach the solute (the salts). It is necessary for the cleaner to reduce the surface tension of the water to better access the salts. The surfactant in the rinse aids, along with the pressurized water, allows the water to better reach the salts which are then pulled into the solution by the water. This also helps to remove insoluble particles and along with light oil and grease.\n\nThis is why most salt removal products require the use of high-pressure water. Generally, the higher the pressure, the more efficient the wash.\n\nThe method\n\n\n\nThe only way to be certain the surface is salt free, even after cleaning, is to run a conductivity test.\n\nMyth #3: \u2018Only Acid-Based Cleaners will Remove Chloride, Sulfate, or Nitrate\u2019\n\nDR. PREPPER: I read a few articles suggesting the only effective way to remove chloride-, sulfate-, or nitrate-containing salts is to use acid-based cleaners.\n\nThere are several products on the market that remove salts from steel. Acidic, neutral, and basic cleaners can all be used effectively.\n\nWhat we learned from the Kennedy Space Cent... (truncated)",

This BIM handbook will make recommendations for good practice based on the current European experience.\n\nDo you think the EU would ever have a BIM mandate?\n\nMandate is a strong word. Technically the UK BIM \u2018mandate\u2019 is policy encouragement to the UK\u2019s public construction client group to require the delivery of BIM information on centrally funded projects. \u00a0It is not easy to see how a single BIM mandate would be applied across Europe \u2013 however, do I see common approaches and requirements for BIM being adopted by European governments and public clients? Yes, absolutely.\u00a0 And looking forward, I see these requirements aligning across Europe.\n\nOver the next three to five years it is likely there will be a growing momentum of consistent BIM requirements in public tenders at national and public estate levels.\u00a0 We are beginning to see this already. Clients are recognising it is not enough simply to request \u201cIt should be BIM\u201d in public tenders: they want to specify standard digital information datasets at key project milestones.\n\nWhat impact will Brexit have on closer collaboration with BIM in Europe?\n\nIn my view, the collaboration has been a European exercise, not just EU \u2013 it actually includes members of the EFTA (European Free Trade Association) such as Norway (a leading partner in the project) and Iceland.\n\nWith regards to Brexit, the EU BIM Task Group is a two year project until end of 2017 which would mean the UK will be a full EU member at that time. And the goal of the group is to align the European approach to introduction of BIM. Beyond Europe, there is recognition that BIM is a global language \u2013 construction will transform to a global \u2018digital construction\u2019 sector over the next five to ten years.\u00a0 The group is collaborating to place the European sector to compete effectively in this market.\n\nI would add that it is a European success \u2013 nations sharing approaches and implementation descriptions in order to agree a common performance level to describe what BIM is to encourage trade across borders.\u00a0 It continues to be a positive and collaborative experience.\n\nIn Part II, Adam answers Where would you say the majority of countries are on their BIM journey?\n\nThis will be answered more fully in the report of the survey recently conducted. I wouldn\u2019t want to pre-empt its findings and conclusions. However, the group recognises that there is a full range from those just starting to explore what BIM means to a public stakeholder\/client to those like Norway, UK and Netherlands that are implementing their programme with industry.\n\nWhat is remarkable has been the journey since 2013, where we started the group with a just handful of nations with active programmes to now \u2013 with over 20 nations involved and the European Commission on-board. I think that speaks volumes about the recognition of the value proposition of BIM to the public sector.\n\n\u2026 For me, one of the most impressive things about the EU BIM Task Group is that all nations are approaching with an open mind and prepared to debate different aspects of adoption and there is no sense at this time of protecting national positions to the detriment of harmonisation.\n\nAfter all, BIM is just part of a broader digital transition across governments, across Europe and across the world.\n\n\nEU BIM Task Group talks about convergence\n\nFifteen European countries sent delegates to a meeting in Brussels last week of the EU BIM Task Group, a group working towards Europe-wide convergence on BIM standards (reports\u00a0UK website BIM+).\n\nRepresentatives of public sector client organisations, policy units and national task groups for the UK, Italy, Portugal, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Slovakia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, France and Iceland all attended the meeting, held at the European Commission\u2019s conference centre.\n\nThe meeting was co-chaired by Adam Matthews, head of EU and international for the UK government\u2019s BIM Task Group. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking to collaborate, align and converge best practice for the introduction of BIM to achieve better value for public money \u2013 that\u2019s the central theme of the group.\u201d\n\nThe group has previously met three times on a voluntary basis, but this time it was facilitated by the European Commission, which provided the conference room and interpreters. Further meetings are planned later this year and up to the middle of 2016.\n\nThe UK was also represented by Mark Bew, chair of the UK BIM Task Group, and Task Group member Barry Blackwell from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.\n\nGermany\u2019s delegates included Arup\u2019s Ilka May, recently appointed as chief executive of its industry-led \u201cPlanen-Bauen 4.0\u201d BIM Task Group.\n\nMatthews added: \u201cThe group is currently defining how it will share best practice and converge on the adoption of BIM into the European public estate.\u201d\n\nHe identified three areas of interest: technical best practice; client leadership; and cultural and people issues, such as skills development and change management.\n\nTwo delegates from Hong Kong were also present as observers, with Ada Fung representing the Ministry of Housing and Ivan Ko the local Construction Industry Council. \u201cIt shows the level of interest from the Asia Pacific region to collaborate and help create a global common market \u2013 it\u2019s becoming a global conversation,\u201d Matthews said.",

The Systems Efficiency Initiative was formed in 2015 to move the whole industry.\n\nClay Nesler was at the Greenbiz VERGE conference in Santa Clara, CA, representing the Alliance to Save Energy, a Washington DC-based organization. Clay and I have worked together on a number of awareness campaigns about showcase energy efficiency building projects: first in 2007 when I led publicity about the first net-zero energy commercial building retrofit in the USA, which featured Johnson Controls radiant heating and cooling, and then in 2010-2012 when we were both involved in communicating about the Empire State Building energy retrofit. It was natural that our conversation emphasized the controls and automation aspects of Clay\u2019s involvement in\u00a0 global energy initiatives, and that we verged into the implications of the IoT for buildings. However, the Systems Efficiency Initiative (SEI) that Nesler and his team at Johnson Controls contribute to as part of the Alliance has a wider scope than we had time to cover in our short interview. To get the broader picture, I encourage you to read\u00a0 the SEI\u2019s report \"Going Beyond Zero: A Systems Efficiency Blueprint for Building Energy Optimization and Resilience\". This comprehensive series of recommendations was developed by a wide range of private and public sector SEI partners, and pulled together by Laura Van Wie McGrory, VP of Special Initiatives, and her team at the Alliance to Save Energy. Here is an edited transcript of my questions and Clay\u2019s responses.\n\nNew Products\nControl Solutions, Inc\nSite Search\nSecuring Buildings News\nPast Issues\nSecured by Cimetrics\n\nAlliance to Save EnergySullivan:\u00a0 The Washington D.C.-based Alliance to Save Energy was formed in the 1970s during the Carter administration, while the Systems Efficiency Initiative (SEI) is just a few years old. Why was the SEI launched, and why now?\n\nNesler:\u00a0 The next quantum leap in building energy efficiency will come from optimizing at a systems level. The Systems Efficiency Initiative was formed in 2015 to move the whole industry -- manufacturers, designers, builders, utilities, national- and state-level government agencies, and efficiency advocates -- from discussion to actions that will move us as quickly as possible into this new era. In previous decades, building codes and equipment standards were the greatest sources of energy efficiency improvements. How do they need to change to drive systems efficiency?\u00a0 To get things rolling in 2016, Alliance to Save Energy and its partners released the Systems Efficiency Initiative (SEI) Year 1 Report, identifying five strategies for promoting a systems approach. Then this Spring, we published a series of recommendations for various stakeholders in the Going Beyond Zero blueprint. Now members of the SEI Steering Committee and Task Groups are working to help translate those recommendations into education programs for and by industry groups, programs for the Department of Energy (DOE) and affiliated organizations, legislative action to align policies and incentives, etc.\n\nSullivanIt sounds like you are describing a disruptive change in business-as-usual when it comes to how building spaces are designed and operated. Why does systems-level optimization require such a retooling across the buildings industries?\n\nNesler:\u00a0 While it has been practical and effective to drive greater efficiency at the component level, some types of equipment are reaching a theoretical limit to performance improvement with that approach. For example, the most efficient water chillers today use variable-speed drives, magnetic bearings, and super-efficient heat exchanger designs. We\u2019re reaching thermodynamic limits to further improvement of these components. There\u2019s little more to do to make a chiller itself more efficient. That\u2019s physics. The good news is that there is no limit to how efficient a chilled water system can be when combined with the most efficient system design for pumps, and cooling towers and optimizing controls. Similarly, in lighting, light bulbs have become increasingly energy-efficient over time. But, today we recognize that the efficiency of a light bulb is potentially less important than whether that light is connected to an occupancy sensor or a daylight sensor, or whether it directly controls blinds, and whether it dims the light automatically. Lightbulb standards don\u2019t address any of this.\n\nSo, the SEI Blueprint recommends ways that manufacturers, associations, and policymakers can look for additional, systems-level savings. OEMs are in a good position to contribute to the development of metrics to measure the performance of various building systems and subsystems in terms of whole-building energy consumption. Likewise, we are recommending that they provide guidance and training to designers and installers on the role of their components within the building system and the ideal configuration to optimize system efficiency.\n\nSullivanWhat you are describing here has a lot to do with optimizing controls. But, to date, most building codes haven\u2019t covered controls in depth? What does the SEI Blueprint say about that?\n\nNesler:\u00a0 Controls are barely considered in building codes today. The language is often like \u2018thou shalt have a controller.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t get explicit about what that controller should do. SEI would like to set in motion a huge industry transformation in this respect. We see building code around energy going from check-the-box prescriptive measures based on component performance to being able to prove the end-performance of building spaces and whole buildings. The code will ask project teams to predict a certain level of performance and then to demonstrate that they\u2019ve met the performance level once the property is built and occupied. All of this has a significant implication for the IoT and advanced controls marketplace. It is only through advanced controls that you can optimize the performance of the components in the context of the whole building. It is through additional sensing, measurement, verification, and analytics that project teams can verify performance.\n\nThe City of Seattle has an alternative building code based on outcomes. Not many buildings have gone through it. But, it is a first step toward the entire design community having enough predictability and control over performance to be able to demonstrate that energy goals have been met. China is also transitioning from prescriptive to outcome-based building energy codes and standards. As outcome-based building code takes hold city-by-city and country-by-country, this will quickly drive up building-level performance worldwide.\n\nEurope is moving in a similar direction. To meet the Energy Efficiency Directive, member states, for the first time, are writing into policy a requirement for building management systems. It is a big step for building codes to stipulate that you must have an automated system if your building is over a certain number of square meters.\n\nSullivanDoes the SEI Blueprint have any recommendations for the master systems integrators and data engineers that are modeling building systems and wrangling with the large quantities of operational data streaming from building equipment, sensors, occupant feedback apps and other sources.\n\nNesler:\u00a0 This challenge epitomizes what the Systems Efficiency Initiative is all about. We know there is a problem when popular green-building rating systems around design and construction and those around operations and maintenance don\u2019t even connect. The feedback loop on design decisions is still broken. Why don\u2019t we use that BIM model that was created when designing the enclosure and laying out the mechanical and electrical systems to do energy optimization? Then, why doesn\u2019t the model carry over to do building commissioning? And why don\u2019t we use that as the basis for optimization over the life of the building? There is no reason with the technology that we have today that this isn\u2019t a realistic vision. We need the whole industry to work toward lifting obstructions to the data flow. Open is good. Every corner of the buildings industry should get behind open standards and figure out how to talk to each other. Project Haystack tagging is an enabling technology as is BIM modeling, OpenADR and the work of other standards bodies too.\n\nA current gap that the SEI Blueprint addresses particularly is the need for easier integration of Miscellaneous Electric Load (MEL) local controls with Building Management Systems. As the efficiency of HVAC and lighting systems has improved, MELs \u2013 also often referred to as \u201cplug\u201d or \u201cprocess\u201d loads encompassing devices from computers to elevators to security systems and medical equipment \u2013 comprise a greater portion of a building\u2019s energy consumption. The Integration of MEL control data with other building system controls is another way that building performance will be optimized overall.\u00a0\n\nSullivan:\u00a0 This new world you describe would be impossible without the underpinnings of smart sensing, smart controls, data analytics, machine learning. How do you see it coming together?\n\nNesler:\u00a0 One of the best examples is the Stanford University Central Energy Facility which has an all-electric heating and cooling system for the campus. Already the Stanford team is using very sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to model energy, thermal cooling\/heating and power requirements for the plant. These algorithms pull in data from the local utility and estima... (truncated)",

How is the sector responding the rising demand for transparency and how are you supporting the fashion industry in becoming more transparent?\n\nHelen Parry: Consumers are becoming much more savvy about the products that they\u2019re buying and want more sustainable products and transparency. If you look at the trends right now, with Nike introducing bio-derived dyes into their footwear. That kind of limited-edition range sells straight away. People are becoming more aware of what is actually possible from a chemical perspective, and are demanding even more from the manufacturers such as ourselves, we need to rise to that challenge.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a shift towards water-based solutions but we can\u2019t stop there. There are still other components to our products so we have to think creatively about how can we make the chemistry even more sustainable.\n\n\u201cBio-derived materials are now offering more durable biodegradable solutions and this is definitely going to play a key role in the future.\u201d\n\nThe more testing and transparency that we can share with brands and retailers will ultimately mean that more information is available to consumers. This is the direction now and it needs to be the focus of chemical manufacturers to think creatively about how we can look for more sustainable solutions.\n\n\nQ: MagnaColours\u00ae has successfully achieved ECO PASSPORT certification for many products alongside the highest level of ZDHC (Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals) MRSL conformance \u2013 level 3. Why did you choose ECO PASSPORT by OEKO-TEX as your certification scheme?\n\nHelen Parry: ECO PASSPORT is the most widely accepted certification in the industry so it was an easy decision for us. We also want to give maximum value and transparency to our customers, this is really an ideal solution that provides warranty and a badge of confidence.\n\nAdapting to Challenges\n\nQ: The unprecedented situation in 2020 and 2021 has posed great challenges with restricted traveling and lockdowns, what are the major challenges in getting your products certified with ECO PASSPORT by OEKO-TEX? And how did you overcome the challenges?\n\nHelen Parry: We continued to test our inks in the same way, sending samples off to TESTEX for evaluation. However, we were delighted that our progression towards our goal of obtaining Level 3 status on ZDHC was not hampered, as TESTEX were able to organise a virtual site audit last November 2020. This was successfully conducted via video and as soon as the restrictions allow, an onsite audit will be organised.\n\nBuilding Compliance into Product Development\n\nQ: Do you have quick steps to share with chemical formulators who would like to start the ECO PASSPORT certification?\n\nHelen Parry: I think it\u2019s important to understand what your customers restricted substances lists are, and to make an assessment against your own products. Start with your simple products that you have a high confidence with and then start to build the certification of your product range based on this. The process of testing is very straightforward but start to think about it during the product development stage. If you embed chemical compliance in at this stage, you don\u2019t have to go back and revisit or reformulate any products.\n\nFind out more about TESTEX here and access the full webinar video on YouTube.

        "text":"Features Profiles\nSpotlight: Patrick Kerrigan of Alpha Poly\n\nMarch 25, 2019\nBy Stefano Ruccia\n\n\nFrom its establishment in 1989, flexible packaging manufacturer Alpha Poly has focused its business on its commitment to customer service and quality, plus the use of up-to-date HD technology. A push for strategic investing led Alpha Poly to install a large 8-colour Miraflex AM from Windmo\u0308ller & Ho\u0308lscher in 2013.Then in December 2018, Alpha Poly ushered in a new wave of strategic investment with the installation of a Windmo\u0308ller & Ho\u0308lscher Miraflex II 10-colour press. PrintAction spoke with Patrick Kerrigan, President of Alpha Poly and successor to the business\u2019 founder, his father Paul, to discuss this newest installation, his thoughts on the industry and the company\u2019s strategic investment plan.\n\nPA: What does the new installation mean for Alpha Poly?\nPK: Number one for us is to always bring on more capacity and look for growth \u2014 strategic planning is important for us [and] allows us to continue to grow. It also adds greater capabilities by moving us from and being able to print up to eight colours. Now we can print up to 10 colours and capabilities wise, that\u2019s great as designs get more complicated and the requirements for those stations. Also, bringing on more capacity as we look to grow as well. It brings us a huge amount of capacity as we look to grow our business.\n\nPA: What is Alpha Poly\u2019s long-term investment plan and vision?\nPK: We have a pretty aggressive strategic plan over the next four years of imminent growth, and this is one asset of a multi-asset capital purchase over the next four years. There is significant capital in other areas in pouch-making and lamination that we\u2019ll look to in the next few years.\n\n\nWhen we look at where we want to go and what we want to do, a big thing for us is we\u2019ve moved into the markets of multi-laminate, rollstock, and stand-up pouches. We look to continue to grow that area and that segment because we see that as an area of growth where we traditionally had passed various focuses on print and poly bags. We find that the laminate market is the growth segment. That is, strategically, where we\u2019re focusing on.\n\nYou hear about employee engagement, atmosphere and environment. For me, a big thing is that we\u2019re a family business, but I look at it as it\u2019s an overall family business for everyone who works here and their extended families. My dad\u2019s always been a visionary and he\u2019s always been looking at the next thing. Taking over from him and continuing in his vision is also important to me.\n\nPA: Are commercial printers focused on packaging growth?\nPK: Most of the people who play in our space, they\u2019ve been set up to do this type of packaging. We\u2019ve always done packaging from a flexible standpoint, it\u2019s not like we were in corrugated and decided to move over into plastic. We\u2019ve targeted an area of stand-up pouches as an area of growth. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested assets that allow us to continue to sell to those segments. I don\u2019t have experience with other converters that weren\u2019t in this market that are moving into it \u2014 it\u2019s more so adding capabilities to grow in that segment.\n\nPA: Why should traditional commercial printers diversify into the packaging space?\nPK: For us, as an example, we\u2019re primarily in the food market and food manufacturers. We\u2019re finding that a lot of companies are moving away from rigids \u2013 like glass and plastics \u2013 and moving toward more laminated and pouch, stand-up pouch or rollstock to help with shelf presence and reduce costs. Rigids can cost a lot of money in terms of their prices, but also their storage in their warehouse, storing the goods before they are packaged, and from a shipping standpoint. There are a lot of advantages to moving toward that kind of growth.\n\nPA: What growth do you see in the sector when it comes to flexible packaging?\nPK: I think the number that we\u2019ve thrown around is that the American market grows by about five percent a year, which is pretty significant. For us, we\u2019re looking for growth in the range of 20-percent plus. That\u2019s the kind of growth we\u2019re looking for. Another thing, in terms of strategic planning, is that the U.S. market is huge for us. We have sales representatives in the U.S. selling for us, that part of strategic planning where we see a lot of growth in the U.S. market.\n\nPA: What are the key factors that are driving this growth?\nPK: I think the U.S. economy is growing, they\u2019re on a roll, and I think that helps. I think transitioning from rigids and such over to flexibles is big, as well as consolidation with our customers. What we find is when there is a lot of consolidation acquisitions happening, that opens up the door to get things moving.\n\nThis Q&A was originally published in the March 2019 issue of PrintAction, now available online.",

        "text":"Back O' Bourke\n\nBroadcast: 31\/03\/2006\n\nReporter: Geoff Sims\n\nQUENTIN DEMPSTER: It was an ambitious enterprise to transform part of the outback into orchards and vineyards where little more than hardy scrub normally grows. Back o' Bourke Fruits was much more than an experiment, but now the family company has gone into voluntary receivership. Geoff Simms reports.\n\nGEOFF SIMMS: It's about as dramatic a contrast as you'll see on the land. From this red and pretty barren soil rose grapes and oranges on a couple of hundred hectares on Bourke's doorstep, beside the Darling. The Mansell family had been south of the border and needed space.\n\nPHILLIP MANSELL: We've pretty much developed everything from scratch when we first came here in '82, and for the first eight years we effectively relocated our business from Mildura because the farm there was only a mile from the centre of town and it was urbanised out.\n\nGEOFF SIMMS: They weren't the first. A hundred years ago oranges were being produced here and exported along with wool to the mother country. But the Mansells wanted to do things the new way. It was called irrigation, using a near-desert climate and taking the water to their plantings.\n\nPHILLIP MANSELL: We started in '82 with sprinkler irrigation. That was regarded then still efficient irrigation systems, and it was in the mid to late '80s that we moved into drip irrigation, because it was seen that it's a hot, dry climate. We came here especially for that because we have a lot less disease and insect pressure here.\n\nGEOFF SIMMS: Drip irrigation meant less water, the climate meant less fungicide and insecticide. The heat produced more sugars, sweeter fruit ready to hit the Sydney markets a week or so before the competition that came from further south. It went well for nearly two decades, until things started to go pear-shaped.\n\nPHILLIP MANSELL: It was about 2000 we had the first major setback, which was a hailstorm that went through part of our new developments. That had an impact for about two years. Then 2002 was the first year of the impact of drought and changing government access to the water started impacting us then.\n\nGEOFF SIMMS: We'll come back to that in a moment. But, whichever way you look at it, it comes down to the drought and it's small comfort to the Mansells that they're not alone.\n\nWAYNE O'MALLY: A lot of people in this area are in their fifth year of drought, and it's been terrifically hard for them to endure this length of period. Out here, normal management practices dictate that you prepare for two- to three-year droughts from time to time. That's accepted. This one's gone on for five years, best part of it now, and showing no signs of letting up.\n\nGEOFF SIMMS: Like so many operations on the land, Back o' Bourke Fruits has had to borrow, but it got more and more difficult.\n\nPHILLIP MANSELL: Through the drought our equity was eroding because we had to keep borrowing funds because we weren't running in a cash-positive situation. That was a combination of still a lot of young plantings on our property, which weren't at full production, so we've had to borrow additional funds.\n\nGEOFF SIMMS: Finally the equity, like so much of the water, simply evaporated. The government last year announced there would be a cut of 67 per cent to the volume of water to be used for irrigation and, without a reliable supply of water, it was no longer considered viable to borrow against the orchards and vineyards. Everybody knew a cap of some sort was coming, but Back o' Bourke Fruits expanded its business in good faith, expecting nothing like the extent of what was announced last year and says others may also be in over their heads.\n\nPHILLIP MANSELL: We're not the only ones that are doing it extremely difficult here in Bourke. We're probably maybe the first that's going, but the current water debate that's ongoing will have other casualties, I can nearly vouch for that.\n\nWAYNE O'MALLY: It's having a major impact because it's part of the irrigation network that provides the local economy with its stimulus. Prior to the drought, Hassells and Associates did a study and they came up with a figure of the irrigation industry contributing $70,000,000 to our local economy, and that translated into 700 full-time jobs. So, in a small town of a population of 3,500, that's a very important factor.\n\nGEOFF SIMMS: And that's something Phillip Mansell understands only too well.\n\nPHILLIP MANSELL: I did the hard yards two or three years ago. I ended up with depression, yes, so I worked through that.\n\nGEOFF SIMMS: He insists the company is a super-efficient water user and has been penalised for its efficiency. He's helping the receivers work out what to do with the business, but it's a bit like treading water. It's all here, established vines and trees, all the infrastructure, the drip irrigation system. You would think somebody, some company looking beyond the drought would be willing to take it on. But rain here is a rare enough event at the best of times, and what people depend on is what comes down the Darling River system. But, now with the cap, buyers are not exactly falling over themselves.\n\nPHILLIP MANSELL: I would see it as a sense of failure for what we set out to achieve if an horticultural industry died in Bourke. It has merit. It's a fantastic climate for doing this sort of stuff in. It can be a bit extreme at times, but that is just putting some management practices into place to combat that.\n\nGEOFF SIMMS: And avoid being left high and dry.",

We find out about them, their careers and their thoughts on the industry. This time it\u2019s the turn of Vpress\u2019 Tim Cox.\n\nMr Cox has been with the company for more than 9 years, spending the overwhelming majority of that time as managing director.\n\nThe People in Print: Tim Cox\n\nName: Tim Cox\nJob title: Managing director\nCompany: Vpress\u00a0\nLocation: Cheltenham\n\nHow did you end up working in the print industry\n\nMy father was a printer (originally a compositor at Cambridge University Press), he ended up running an SME print firm that I grew up around and worked at for a while, prior to joining DRG Litho Supplies in a sales role.\n\nWhat was your first job in print?\n\nGeneral dogs\u2019 body, doing everything from spotting out film and making plates to running small presses\u2026 and no, I don\u2019t want to do any moonlighting!\n\nWhat are your future goals?\n\nPersonally? This might sound unambitious and a bit hippy like, but those who know me well won\u2019t be surprised. It\u2019s simply to help people, help the trade, be happy, content and have peace of mind.\n\nIf the question relates to work? That\u2019s easy, to ensure the continued growth of Vpress, the Coreprint web-to-print technology and our incredible team, with a load more customers and maybe a little more work life balance!\n\nWhat innovation\/technology in print is making you most excited?\n\nI would be negligent if I didn\u2019t say web-to-print\/online brand management and the realisation that they are a necessity, not a \u2018nice to have\u2019 for those in the world of print, print management, brand management and agencies.\n\nHowever, without my obvious bias, I would say its less of a single innovation or technology that excites me, more how we are all witnessing a total convergence of technologies and the once separate industry sectors and technologies, finally converging into one all-encompassing integrated approach and means of communication.\n\nWhat is the biggest issue\/challenge facing the industry?\n\nApologies for the seeming \u2018dig\u2019 and generalisation, but for me it\u2019s the ignorance and denial about print continuing to change, and the lack of solid business planning and strategy among the larger proportion of the print and graphic sectors. That has to be addressed and change, within their own businesses and how they engage their customers.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone just entering the industry?\n\nBelieve, do things differently and don\u2019t believe negative BS that \u2018print\u2019s dead\u2019\u2026 its far from dead, its just changing and remains one of the most diverse verticals to build a career within!\n\nWhat has been the biggest change since you entered print?\n\nAlthough it\u2019s been over quarter of a century, and many still have some way to go, it has to be how traditional processes and mindsets have shifted to embrace, adopt and change to embrace digital technologies, advancements and the many onslaughts the print sector has had to endure.\u00a0\n\nIf you could go back and seize one opportunity you missed, what would it be?\n\nOther than not buying shares in Apple? I honestly can\u2019t think of anything, after all, If I did that I might not have ended up where I am now, would I?\n\nWhat one thing should the industry do to ensure its continued success?\n\nBe positive, be open minded and keep trying to embrace the new instead of fighting it\u2026.\n\nDo you belong to any industry bodies or trade organisations? Why?\n\nPICON\u00a0\u2013 I\u2019m a council member \u2013 as the overarching body representing UK manufacturers in print, it is the barometer, sounding block and impartial organisation that has supported and united the many disparate sector bodies representing our industry.\n\nIPIA\u00a0\u2013 since its change of stewardship a few years ago, IPIA has, in my eyes, swiftly become the most dynamic, forward thinking trade body within our sector and has not only realised the importance of embracing creatives, agencies and brands upstream of print, but has also striven to change the perception of print in the eyes of these sectors and set in motion a number of directives to ensure this happens.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about working print?\n\nIts sheer diversity and the fact it is one of the only industries that touches and is relevant to every business and person on the planet.\n\nHow do you think the Coronavirus pandemic will impact digital print in the medium to long term?\n\nHopefully it has woken those who need it from complacency, stimulating them to not wait until someone asks for a service or technology offering and instead to be proactive in their plans, investment, and customer approach.\n\nCovid-19 has, in my eyes, potentially become the final roll call for those printers still in denial or unsure if digital and the internet has a place in their business. There is no longer any place for doubts surrounding its relevance, importance, or it\u2019s place in every printer\u2019s future. Any denial of this after this pandemic is likely to see at best a slow death for a business.",

        "text":"Process Performance Improvement - Part 2\n\nContinuation of the Interview with Mike Brown on Performance of Process Control Tools\n\nMcMillan and WeinerBy Greg McMillan and Stan Weiner\n\nGreg McMillan and Stan Weiner bring their wits and more than 66 years of process control experience to bear on your questions, comments, and problems.\u00a0Write to them at\n\nStan: We continue our interview with Mike Brown, who has focused on the bottom-line performance of process control tools for basic and advanced control systems in his role as Vice President, North America Solutions at Matrikon Inc.\n\nGreg: Where are the greatest opportunities today to better leverage tools and technology in process control to help deliver true performance improvement?\n\nMike: The biggest weakness and scale is still at the regulatory level. Base-level control has really not improved much given all the changes and improvements on the systems side. We need to be more flexible about how we support process control requirements, and the tools also need this flexibility. Today, advanced process control (APC) tools in industries like air separation are often designed, implemented and commissioned completely with remote services and fully supported by a centralized model of non-APC experts. Without the flexibility of the tools to support this model, these advanced control benefits in the air separation business would not have been possible.\n\nStan: What are some specific examples of ways to get non-control people to use control technology to deliver process improvements?\n\nMike: Bring 24X7 operators into the tuning workflow. Recent developments in tuning tools, such as closed-loop testing and identification, tuning of closed loop cascades and tuning of interactive loops now make this possible. Tuning tools are also shifting away from complex math and process control talk towards simpler understanding for process engineers. Working with process response curves that show open-loop response time, closed-loop response time, stability and confidence for both old and proposed tuning can really change the paradigm.\n\nAnother example is to combine some of the simple PID metrics of a monitoring system, such as percent saturation of a control loop, and use some powerful visualization techniques, such as tree maps, to analyze this information across a plant. Giving the process engineer the ability to quickly visualize all the flow controllers in a plant that have high output saturation is a great way to understand hydraulic limits and the need for bypass management. Further, looking at the same information for all temperature controllers provides a good overview of heating and cooling constraints. This is information that can easily be presented to the process engineer on a plant-wide basis in less than five seconds and provides good process knowledge. How long would it take for most process engineers to pull this data?\n\nAgain, simplification and robustness of these tools are essential to make this model work. Technologies usually evolve by adding features to solve that last 5% of complexity that exists. In many cases, the tools become too complicated for the non-expert to apply, and the expert is too busy to get to the problem. Technology development needs to focus more on easily solving 80% of the cases with a simple and robust approach that can be implemented by non-control specialists, such as process engineers, operators and instrumentation technicians. Imagine the case where 80% of all regulator loops could be optimally maintained by the shift operator, or 80% of the advanced control applications could be implemented by process engineers who really understand the process economics. This will require sophisticated technologies, but the complexity needs to be directed at the robustness of the tool and hidden from the user.\n\nGreg: Some of the changes that you are proposing are fundamental to how an organization does things. Why do you think they will recognize the need for these changes?\n\nMike: They really do not have a choice. The fact is that their organizations are changing, and plants do not have the same level of staffing or dedicated expertise that they carried twenty years ago. Management knows this, and they only see it getting worse as more expertise retires. Companies that twenty years ago had a process control team of six people now have a team of two people who are just able to keep the control system infrastructure running and updated to current releases. Twenty years ago, advanced control projects were often executed with a team of two consultants supported by two engineers from the operating company. Today, a single third-party consultant is expected to independently deliver the application. In many cases, the knowledge never gets effectively transferred to the operating company. If operating companies are going to re-establish ownership of their process control improvement initiatives, they need simpler technology that allows greater flexibility of the resources that can be assigned to these tasks.\n\nAugust 2010 Comic\n\nStan: What will be required for companies to support these efforts in the long term?\n\nMike: They need to see the economic results associated with these technologies and understand what is actually causing these economic effects.\n\nThere was a very good publication a few years ago by a U.S. chemical company trying to understand the real source of economics behind the recent application of a model-predictive controller (MPC) in an ethylene plant. The application demonstrated significant economic benefits mostly due to higher production rates, but there was a sense that over time, the benefits were not being sustained to the levels demonstrated post-commissioning. The immediate reaction was to bring back the consultant to review the design of the MPC controller, but one smart process engineer decided instead to take a Six Sigma approach to the analysis and to start documenting the magnitude and root cause of the benefits reduction each time the MPC controller was not able to push to maximum charge rates. After three months of analysis, a simple Pareto chart clearly showed that over 75% of the MPC controller benefits degradation was due to analyzer downtime, operational issues, operator training and instrumentation. There were no issues with the MPC controller design and its associated models. However, since the economics associated with these functions were now clearly linked to process control improvements and process benefits, there was now support for improvements in areas such as analyzer maintenance and operator training.\n\nTaking the analysis one step further, the study extracted simple operator change data on MPC variables, such as constraint limits and manipulated variable limits. This data demonstrated that over time, as operators made more changes to the controller, the benefits dropped. Lack of operator understanding and intervention more often reduced the MPC controller's ability to truly optimize the process and maximize the production rates. Operations managers were now able to monitor the number of operator changes to MPC variable limits on a weekly basis and establish a threshold at which they would re-train the operator on the proper management of the controller. This is an example of operations people performing simple monitoring of control information in order to improve process control performance with a clear understanding of the economic benefits.\u00a0\n\nGreg: See if Mike's \"Top Ten List\" can help you get better traction within your organization for the adoption of process control technologies.\u00a0\n\nTop Ten Ways to Help Non-Control Engineers \"Get\" Process Control\n\n10) Explain that in a typical plant, 70% of manufacturing processes or production units are under some form of process control.\n9) Tell them that most process control technologies involve using a joystick.\n8) Tell them that process control improvements give instant gratification: Designing a plant may take years to see the results, but process control improvements are visible within days.\n7) Tell them that on Fridays, control engineers get extra BBQ at the plant cafeteria.\n6) Show them that advanced control technologies are the best way to understand real plant limits and bottlenecks.\n5) Tell them that plant operators will be nicer to them.\n4) The best control engineers are also very good process engineers \u2026 so they can do two jobs!\n3) Tell them that control engineers get 50% of all their savings as a Christmas bonus.\n2) Demonstrate how most plants can achieve up to a 5% production increase, 10% better energy efficiencies, or 15% better yield improvements with better process control.\u00a0\u00a0\n1) Point them to the Control survey that shows how process control engineers have better sex lives.\n\nShow Comments\nHide Comments\n\nJoin the discussion\n\nWe welcome your thoughtful comments.\nAll comments will display your user name.\n\nWant to participate in the discussion?\n\nRegister for free\n\nLog in for complete access.\n\n\nNo one has commented on this page yet.\n\nRSS feed for comments on this page | RSS feed for all comments",

        "text":"New Technologies Aid in Compliance Reporting\n\nBy Jessie Fetterling\n\nTechnology continues to transform the corrections industry as new ones emerge onto the market. While traditional compliance reporting involved simply recording notes using pen and paper, mobile-device apps have made it much easier to manage daily compliance workflows.\n\nRaken is one of the compliance-related apps on the market, created to ease the challenges of compliance reporting.\nPhoto Credit: Raken\n\nCorrectional News spoke with Dr. Sergey\u00a0Sundukovskiy, co-founder of Raken, one of the compliance-related apps on the market, to discuss the growing technology trends and how they relate to compliance reporting.\u00a0\n\nQ: Describe the traditional method of compliance recording.\n\nSundukovskiy: The traditional method of compliance recording involves pen and paper. The superintendent or job foreman makes handwritten notes and files them away in a paper binder. Project managers, office personnel and owners review these notes on a semi-regular basis to understand the status of the project.\n\nQ: What new technologies are available to make daily compliance reporting easier?\n\nSundukovskiy: There are a number of new and emerging technologies that are destined to disrupt the construction industry in general and construction daily compliance reporting in particular. One of the key tipping points in the construction industry in the context of technology was a wide availability of mobile devices with high-resolution cameras and an ability to run native applications that facilitate daily compliance workflows. Raken takes full advantage of the smart device capabilities to facilitate voice activated or interactive mobile app communication and daily work log management. We are also on the cusp of another set of disruptive changes in technology in general and construction technology in particular. We are starting to see the initial use of drones, virtual reality, augmented reality, predictive modeling spurred by maturing cloud and big data\/fast data capabilities. All of these emerging technologies will find reflective application in the construction industry.\n\nQ: What benefits are there to using these technologies?\n\n\nSundukovskiy: Most of the general technological advances are targeted at gaining efficiency and improving accuracy. Above mentioned technologies are certainly not an exception. For example, predictive project modeling can be used to achieve greater accuracy in project estimation, where drone photography can be utilized to gain efficiency in job-site surveying and monitoring.\n\nQ: How did the idea of the Raken app come to fruition?\n\nSundukovskiy: Raken was a customer-driven collaboration effort between Founder and CEO Kyle Slager and nearly 100 prospective clients in the industry. Slager believed that when we started this company there weren\u2019t great mobile solutions for the everyday workflows of field personnel and that one of the greatest pain points in the industry was daily reporting. Now, with more than 2,500 customers, the feedback has been incredible, and Raken has added additional work flows based on customer feedback. For example, since launching with daily reporting, the company has added photo management, customized safety reporting and executive dashboards for office personnel as well as automated the collection of daily reports from subcontractors to general contractors.\n\nQ: How do apps like this serve a greater trend in the\u00a0correctional industry?\u00a0\n\nSundukovskiy: Mobile apps like Raken, dealing with various aspects of the construction industry, points to a general trend of technology disruption. Construction has always been one of the industries that are late adopters of the emerging technologies. Raken is among the latest crop of technology startups dealing with the construction industry, and it is certainly bucking the conservative image of the industry.\n\nQ: What is the future of compliance recording in the construction industry as a whole?\n\nSundukovskiy: The vector of development in compliance recording in the construction industry is along the lines of the previously mentioned technologies. One specific emerging area of development is related to machine learning and image recognition. Automated image processing, tagging and identification have been long coveted for compliance purposes. Using Artificial Intelligence to identify compliance problems would result in greater precision, early detection and considerable time savings when compared to similar activities performed by a human.\n\n\n%d bloggers like this:",

        "text":"The Urban Lumber Company\n\n\nAn interview with\u00a0Tim O\u2019Neill\n\n\nHow did your business get started?\n\nI started The Urban Lumber Company in 2005 with 150 trees that I sold to buddies \u2014 I know a lot of woodworkers. It was mainly run out of my garage until 2012 when Missouri Organic Recycling reached out to me. The Anderson family was looking to start selling urban wood as a natural extension to their Food Residuals Environmental Diversion (FRED) program. They didn\u2019t have a background in woodworking or lumber, they were literally financiers who entrusted me to build the operation up because of my passion for the topic.\n\nWhat is your urban wood business model?\n\nThe Urban Lumber Company operates as an independent LLC from Missouri Organic Recycling. We source logs from parks\/recreation departments and municipalities around Kansas City, as well as individuals, but our biggest and best source for logs are developers and architects for larger construction projects. When construction companies have to do a major demo, they bring us in to grab logs off of the site. This helps them, and it softens the impact of new construction, both environmentally and socially.\n\nFor instance, we recently received 130 logs from a huge remodel at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Once the logs are milled and kiln-dried, we put the location of harvest on each board and add them to our database. Since our opening in May of 2014, we have recycled more than 838,000 pounds of wood and processed more than 90,800 board feet. Check our tracker for updated numbers at\n\nWho are your customers?\n\nWe thought if we sold lumber at the base level that the market would be made up of woodworkers, but we have found a number of loyal customers in people who respond to the wood grain, want an organic element in their personal space and in life. They arrive in our showroom to select slabs for table tops, shelves, coffee tables, and we do the finish work and the delivery. Some people want to take the rough lumber, others want us to sand finish it, and others we work with all the way through installation.\n\nWho aren\u2019t your customers?\n\nWe are not yet selling larger projects to contractors and architects. In fact, we have had to turn projects down because we currently cannot work in large quantities. We are working on a grant to get a new kiln, which will increase our capacity and rack space. Offering larger quantities will better help us engage with the design community, including flooring, paneling, and larger residential projects.\n\nName the best resources you encountered that you\u2019d like to share with others.\n\nWe received a solid waste management grant in 2013 from the Environmental Improvement and Energy Resources Authority (EIERA) and are now applying for a second grant through the same organization.\n\nMissouri Organic Recycling has provided the most support and resources but they also helped us with our showroom. We went out of our way to make our showroom have a nice, comfortable feel that reflects our personalities, and it has been a big source of our success and growth. We are not located in the best neighborhood, and people have to dog through our inventory to find the piece they are looking for. So it is always a big confidence boost every time new customers come in and their jaws kind of drop, then they say, \u201cThis is awesome!\u201d\n\nHow do you promote your business?\n\nI\u2019d say about 95 percent of our first-time customers find us through a Google search. We tried a direct mail piece, but my impression was that it was not the best use of money compared to Facebook and Instagram. We also get a good amount of business from word-of-mouth.\n\nOnce we have customers, we regularly email them through Mail Chimp. We have a mailing list of about 1,250 people who we reach out to with new inventory. It is remarkable how many people come in after reading the emails, sometimes within the next day. We recently brought in a terrific load of lumber \u2014 15 slabs \u2014 we emailed images and information to our mailing list, and within two weeks it was almost picked clean.\n\nWhat is the best lesson you have learned about your customers?\n\nPeople want to know about their woodgrain, where it came from, and when they find a cool piece of lumber, they love it. They don\u2019t want us to waste trees and they like the fact that we do something out of the ordinary with what would normally go to waste. They are willing to invest in us because they know our hearts are in it and that we are striving to do our best work for them.\n\nName your top three challenges working with urban wood.\n\n  1. Every time our profit increases our expense increase directly \u2014 we are always learning how to become more cost effective between employment, insurance, workman\u2019s comp and general operating costs.\n  2. We can\u2019t be everything to everyone. Some examples of answers we give often:\n    \u2022 We are only open Thursday afternoon, Friday afternoon, and Saturday morning because we are making lumber the rest of the time.\n    \u2022 No matter how much people ask, it is very difficult to keep walnut in stock.\n    \u2022 We don\u2019t buy trees from residences unless it is walnut.\n    \u2022 We don\u2019t have a grapple truck, so we need to rely on tree services to pick up logs for us.\n    \u2022 We don\u2019t dry wood for people because we have limited kiln space, but, we are happy to offer advice and instruction on air drying wood.\n  3. Managing priorities \u2014 We have no roadmap because mainly, we are responding to a market that is still taking shape. Sometimes we invest in directions that don\u2019t pan out.\n\nWhat do you love most about working with urban wood?\n\nI like to say we are enabling creativity in Kansas City, and of all the different aspects of the business, I feel most passionate about that. I got into the business because I saw urban wood as a resource that was being wasted when I myself was buying wood. Urban wood is more beautiful because it was not a commercially planted tree. I enjoy seeing the weird, different, fun, and funky stuff people respond to. To witness people\u2019s wheels start spinning is a great and rewarding experience. And now I feel I can do that for a whole city. That is a rush. I love it.\u00a0\n\nImage Gallery\n\nJoin the Movement\n\nOur mission is to inform, collaborate, and connect to build business and consumer confidence in the urban wood industry.

Separately, there is the current active portfolio, which involves about three projects worth $200 million and that is benefiting 616 thousand people.\n\n\n\net: Are you planning any new projects?\n\n\nLuis: There are ongoing discussion with the government with regards to further projects on environment issues.\n\n\n\net: Per your visit to IFAD\u2019s projects sites in Egypt, what progress have you seen in terms of building people\u2019s resilience to climate conditions?\n\n\nLuis: One of the really important things we saw during our visit was the wide range of activities across different areas, including: meteorological stations, as farmers need up-to-date information about what is going to be the weather, and also livestock facilities, in addition to irrigation and ways to increase production, which we saw in the new areas and that was very interesting for me. \u00a0\n\n\nYahya: First, the impact of the investments is seen in the joy that comes with it; it cannot be quantified.\n\n\nMost of the women clearly said that before they got involved with IFAD projects, they really did not have confidence, but with the ability to do what they are planning, this brought them some money to take care of the family, and help their husbands and build the next generation. And that is the beauty of what IFAD is doing. \u00a0\n\n\nThe second point is that there is a strong government commitment to actually help the vulnerable, and part of what is required is to provide infrastructure, with electricity in place and so much construction going on. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nYahya Olaniran, the Spokesperson and Lead of IFAD\u2019s Executive Board delegation during the interview - Photo by Mohamed Ezz el-Din\u00a0\n\n\n\net: How do you see a nation-wide initiative like Haya Karima is contributing to your role in improving livelihoods of people in rural areas?\n\n\nLuis: One aspect is really the ownership that the government has taken with regard to these issues. We have the deputy minister of Agriculture with us, and we are in constant contact with the population.\n\n\nSo there is a commitment to agriculture that we have seen, and IFAD is definitely a good partner in that. One thing that\u2019s worth mentioning from what we have seen are the figures and the numbers, for example, as we got briefed on crop yields like tomatoes that has been increased by 107 percent, also food waste and post-harvest losses have been reduced, prices increased because the quality had improved, besides the pride people take in their work, and the future they see for themselves and for their children. That\u2019s really the distinction that it is great to be part of. We always used to say Egypt\u2019s success is IFAD\u2019s success as well and we take pride to do it together.\n\n\n\net: Egypt has been incorporating digital transformation into its system over the past period, launched digital literacy campaigns, and recently announced digital withdrawal of IFAD\u2019s fund to projects in Egypt. How do you see the effect of such step helps reach food safety standards as well as protect Egypt's exports?\n\n\n\nLuis: Digitalization is extremely important, and that was also one of the aspects that we saw during our field visit; there is a platform that connects farmers to markets that is quite impressive, because farmers need to know where to sell and what the prices are.\n\n\nA small key is what IFAD is able to do individually with the government in the sense of the loan dispersing being done digitally, which facilitates and accelerates, where you do not have to wait for paper signature to come back and forth.\n\n\nEZZ48724IFAD Secretary Luis Jim\u00e9nez-McInnis during the interview - Photo by Mohamed Ezz el-Din\u00a0\n\n\n\net: Egyptian gov\u2019t issued a report saying that Egypt skipped the trap of commodity dependence, and its negative consequences thanks to its diversified exports. How far do you see Egypt from strong export competitiveness?\n\n\nLuis: During the field trips, we went to visit Belco, there we definitely saw a company that is working with the export sector, but most importantly with IFAD that it is working with the smallholder farmers, and it is connecting smallholder farmers\u2019 communities to markets.\n\n\nAnd I think for us that\u2019s really the key angle, as we see the figures in terms of that one third of the food in the world comes from smallholder farmers, and again the whole value chain is important because at Belco, we saw basically the packaging that is going on, and employment that it generates.\n\n\nSo, increasing income for men and women is very important because during the visits, we saw children are now being able to go to school or stay there, because of the income being generated.\n\n\nIn terms of exports capacity, I can say that living in Italy I can definitely see some Egyptian products sold there. One of the key to grow this is to work with smallholder farmers, and giving them capacity.\n\n\n\nAbout Luis Jim\u00e9nez-McInnis:\n\n\nMr Luis Jim\u00e9nez-McInnis is the Secretary of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\u00a0 From 2016-2019, he was Director of the Partnership and Resource Mobilization Office. He joined IFAD in February 2010 as Special Adviser to the President.\n\n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nBe Social",

        "text":"13 September 2012\n\nEast Africa: Farmers Adapting but Food Insecurity Persists, Researcher Says\n\nPhoto: P. Casier\/CGIAR\nFarming the land with the help of cattle in Kenya.\n\nWashington, DC \u2014 About a year after East Africa's worst drought in six decades peaked, a survey of more than 700 smallholder farmers across four regional countries reveals that food insecurity remains a pressing problem.\n\nThe study, by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security, also shows that farmers have been adopting innovative agricultural techniques for the past decade, but food insecurity continues to limit their adaptability.\n\nMore than half of all households surveyed are implementing strategies to improve crop production and cope with climate change, researchers say.\u00a0However, many of these modifications are incremental, and farmers may need to innovate faster and more extensively to meet the challenges of a changing climate and a growing demand for food.\n\nStudy leader Patti Kristjanson, of the Nairobi-based World Agroforestry Centre, spoke with AllAfrica's Lauren Everitt about the report's findings, the role of governments in agricultural innovation and the urgency of tackling food insecurity. The agricultural economist says there is no \"silver bullet\" but she's optimistic that women, information technology and farmer enthusiasm can all be leveraged to help alleviate food insecurity in East Africa.\n\nYour study found that high levels of food insecurity prevent small farmers from adopting innovative agricultural techniques. Could you elaborate on the relationship between the two?\n\nThis was a broad survey of many different countries of randomly chosen households, which weren't selected to be the poorest households or anything. So we're finding that across all these very diverse places levels of food insecurity are still high, and that was a sobering finding.\n\nWe asked the households: 'How many months of the year do you struggle to find food from any source at all?' So this is not just about food self-sufficiency; it's any way of getting food. Again, we found that in Kenya, for example, up to two months of the year, many households still struggle to get food from any source for their families. And that went up to six months of the year in Ethiopia.\n\nAnd so we asked farmers to tell us about the changes they'd been making to their farming systems for any reason - to your crops, to your livestock, to your water management and your soil management. We tried to pull a description because we realized we don't have a very clear picture across the board of the kinds of changes people are making.\n\nAnd then we asked farmers why they made those changes, such as switching to shorter cycle crops. And the reasons are many and complex just like us. When we change our behavior, we don't do it for one reason. We found that they were doing it because of market reasons or labor, or land, and yes, indeed, weather and climate did come up. But we didn't go in and say: 'Tell us how climate change is affecting your behavior.' That's not a good approach because people will tell you what you want to hear.\n\nThe levels of food insecurity are still very high and we did find a very strong relationship between that and the number of changes people were making already. In that sense, adaptation or innovativeness does seem to be constrained by the food insecurity situation. Now that's not a causal analysis so we can't say food insecurity causes this, but the fact that it's showing up in such diverse places does tell us that we need to explore that relationship more and not take for granted that it's just about getting better information about new technologies to farmers.\n\nIf they have such serious constraints and are unable to take up new practices, then we have to address that root cause first. So it really points to the need to pay special attention to the food security situation. Having said that, it's not all bad news. People are changing their behaviors, they are taking up new practices, they're eager for new information and knowledge. But they need some of the constraints that they're dealing with addressed so that they can change and do new things.\n\nYour study found that many households were already adopting innovative farming techniques. Fifty-five percent of households had taken up at least one shorter-cycle crop variety and 56 percent had adopted at least one drought tolerant variety over the last decade. What influenced those changes? Were they self initiated or influenced by governments or non-governmental organizations?\n\nThat's a very good question, and we're trying to tease that out of the analyses that are underway right now, because, like I said, we did ask them why they made these changes. The answer is all of the above. People give numerous reasons for having done it.\n\nWe are talking about villages and places where a lot of different things have been happening. We didn't go into places in the middle of nowhere that have not had projects or programs or initiatives underway. Indeed, in Africa, it's not very easy to find places like that. So, yes, there have been projects, there has been research going on, there have been NGOs working in there.\n\nThis analysis was not aimed at answering that particular question, by the way. We're not asking to what extent projects or programs influenced the uptake of technology, that's for another study. So there's only so much we can say about that.\n\nBut the next paper, in fact, is going to get at that issue quite a bit more than this paper did. This one was focused on getting the news out quickly about what kind of changes are already underway and what people are doing already.\n\nIt was to address the question of: Why are we seeing more soil and land management practices, water storage and agroforestry? People are planting trees on farms, but it's not as much as we'd like to see. It's small numbers of trees. So we want to see more of the practices that will make farmers more resilient to a change in climate. So this was a first baby step in the direction of 'tell us what you're doing already' so we can do more research on some of these issues now.\n\nWhat is the government's role in incentivizing small farmers to adopt innovative agricultural approaches?\n\nThe government has a huge role to play. The emphasis on agricultural research and development efforts has been very, very low throughout the region. Governments have committed to allocate 10 percent of their total budgets to agriculture, but in this region they're nowhere near that. So we have to invest in this sector. It's really going to need it if we're going to enhance food security because it's still at a very, very low level.\n\nYou're quoted as saying that \"as rainfall patterns shift, and average temperatures rise due to climate change, [farmers] may need to change faster and more extensively.\" How soon do farmers have to make these changes?\n\nThey're already talking about seeing more extreme events and more variability. We definitely know over the next 10, 20, 30 years that this is only going to increase.\n\nBut it's not immediate, and I don't want this to be a gloom-and-doom message that you have to change tomorrow. However, farmers definitely have to be thinking about these things and starting to shift. So that's why it's good we're seeing some changes going on and that people are starting to think about it and that there is much more awareness about climate change.\n\nHaving said that, farmers are not necessarily changing their behavior because of climate change. That's a luxury wealthy people have when we decide not to take a flight because we want to do something good for climate change. That's not where these smallholder farmers are coming from. But they are much more aware, and they're getting access to so much more information than they used to.\n\nThis points to a lot of new opportunities with new ICTs for getting information through cell phones, through television. More and more people in this region have televisions and are watching television; everyone's got a radio, everyone's got a cell phone or access to a cell phone, so there are huge opportunities to get information on different options, which is what it's all about. But there's no silver bullet or one magic technology for any particular place.\n\nHow do you motivate smallholder farmers to adopt innovative agricultural techniques and implement these changes rapidly? Is there one technique or program that has emerged from your research that has been more successful than others?\n\nIncluding women in the discussion and giving them more access to information. We know that many of the household farm level decisions are made by women, as well as men, but women have been largely left out of the information loop. So a key strategy is to include them in all efforts and to specifically target them. That's not to say exclude the men or threaten the men, but definitely including the women more than we have been and trying to reach women in more innovative ways.\n\nThat said, I have yet to interview a farmer anywhere in Africa that doesn't tell me they're dying for more and better information than they're getting. So we still have a long way to go.\n\nHow do you counter critics who say that agricultural innovations, such as genetically modified crops, are a Western product meant to serve Western agricultural business interests?\n\nThis is not my area of expertise, but farmers need all the different kinds of options and strategies and approaches that they can get. This is a huge challenge. In this day and age to see so many farmers still struggling to just make it through the year and feed their families shows that we've got to do way, way more about it.\n\nIf smallholder farmers could only adopt only one of the many recommended agricultural changes, which in your estimation would be the most effective?\n\nWell I worry about that because there isn't any silver bullet. But water shortages are going to... (truncated)",

        "text":"Russia reaches self-sufficiency in production of poultry and pork\n\n16 may 2016 | RBC-TV\n\nDeputy Head of the Department for Expert Analytics of the Analytical Center Elena Razumova talked about the situation in Russia\u2019s agricultural sector in a live interview for RBC-TV. According to the National Report on the Implementation in 2015 of the State Program for the Development of the Agricultural Sector, the growth in agriculture may slow down this year, with output expanding by no more than 1% as opposed to 3% it gained in 2015.\n\nElena Razumova\nElena Razumova\nDepartment for Expert Analytics\n\n\"One of the problems in agriculture is the shrinking domestic market: because of the difficult economic situation, consumption is slumping, people are spending less,\" the expert said. \"Another problem is restricted access to foreign markets. On some key positions, for example poultry and pork, we have already reached self-sufficiency in terms of output but we have not been able to find other markets to sell to so there is no room for growth.\" The situation with beef is more complicated because it is more expensive for the end consumer and it takes longer to breed cattle, Ms. Razumova explained.\n\n\"With regards to essential groceries such as poultry and pork we have reached the full import substitution threshold in the short term.\" In the long term we are capable of hitting import substitution targets for vegetables and milk. However, with some groceries, we simply can not produce substitutes, for example nuts,\" Ms. Razumova said. As far as the situation with, say, apples, is concerned, in that field long term investments are needed to make sure all apple trees begin to produce apples and it is going to take about 4 years, according\u00a0to\u00a0Ms. Razumova. The state plans to allocate subsidies, but it is unclear whether business is going to invest in this sector because of the risks that any long term investments are exposed to due to the embargo, the expert noted.\n\nShe believes that after Russia imposed an embargo, Russian consumers suffered because of the closure of markets. But there are some positives about the current situation. \"We have freed up a lot of markets for milk, meat, vegetables, and fruits. For example, we\u00a0are already seeing an increase in the output of cucumbers and tomatoes.\u00a0However it is going to take some time before we see the full result,\" Ms. Razumova pointed out.",

        "text":"PORTLAND, ORE. \u2014 In his 29 years in the grain industry, Kurt Haarmann, senior vice president of grain, for Portland-based Columbia Grain, said he\u2019d never used the phrase, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this before,\u201d until this spring, when war broke out between Russia and Ukraine, severely limiting grain shipments from the Black Sea region. Besides the war between two major grain exporters, the grain industry is dealing with ongoing supply chain issues stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and drought-related crop shortfalls in the Americas and other important grain producing countries. This chaotic mix of circumstances has resulted in record-high grain prices and reduced global carryover stocks, particularly for wheat, to levels not seen for several decades.\n\nLike its competitors, Columbia Grain, a vertically integrated company that purchases grain, oilseeds, pulses and organics from more than 8,000 farmers in the northern tier of the United States and operates assets including grain elevators, processing plants and agronomy centers, is operating in unchartered territory as it works to ship its products around the world, mainly to China and other Asian countries.\n\nMr. Haarmann recently spoke with World Grain, a sister publication of Milling & Baking News, about these developing crises, their short- and long-term impacts on global markets and the steps Columbia Grain has taken to remain profitable and provide solutions for its suppliers and customers in such a volatile business environment.\u00a0\n\nWG: What concerns you most about the current state of the grain markets?\u00a0\n\nHaarmann: My biggest concern right now is the unprecedented volatility in markets. It makes it incredibly difficult for producers, and it makes it difficult for our buyers. Right now, it is very difficult for traders and handlers of grain to manage basic risk positions. A number of things will have to occur to get us back to some sort of normalcy. First, we will need a resolution to the situation in the Black Sea \u2014 whatever that looks like \u2014 so the market has a feel or belief of what can consistently or safely be supplied there. If that doesn\u2019t happen, we really need the other major grain-producing nations of the world to rebuild stocks over a series of crop years to the point where we get a comfortable cushion of stocks in the world again and we can readjust those trade flows. If you ask me which comes first, that\u2019s a tough one. Russian objectives are driven by one man and I\u2019m not sure anybody can get inside his head. Right now, the market is scared of its own shadow. It\u2019s scared that it\u2019s too high or scared that it\u2019s not high enough. Until we are able to eliminate risk in the market or at least limit it, you cannot eliminate that volatility.\u00a0\n\nWG:\u00a0If the war were to end tomorrow, how long would it take for the market to regain some equilibrium?\u00a0\n\nHaarmann: I imagine you\u2019d see a big selloff to begin with. Still, though, it would depend on the physical reality of the situation. Say it starts with a Russian withdrawal. The market is still going take time to ascertain how much damage has been done to infrastructure. What is Ukraine\u2019s actual export capabilities? Are the stocks still in a position of quality? Can they still be brought to market? What does the new crop look like? How much was it limited by fuel, fertilizer and manpower shortages? It will take a while even if the conflict ended tomorrow. It would take a while for the ripple to come back out of the world markets. We do have other stories impacting the market, whether it\u2019s dry weather in the United States or unfavorable weather during the previous growing season in South America. You also still have strong Chinese demand for grains and oilseeds, so we have other parts of the story that were tightening balance tables before we removed so much product from the world supply.\u00a0\n\nWG: To what degree are supply chain inefficiencies contributing to the grain market volatility?\u00a0\n\nHaarmann: I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a simple solution to the supply chain issue because when you get all people together from the different points involved, whether it\u2019s shipping, warehousing, retailing, or production, you get a little bit different perspective from each person as to what exactly is wrong. What is clear is we had a massive change in consumer buying habits that started before the pandemic that really accelerated. No one goes to the store anymore. No one goes to the mall. The whole warehousing scheme has gone out window and is trying to be replaced by direct door-to-door delivery. It impacts truck driver shortages and fuel use, so costs are a big part of it. Also, you have a zero COVID policy in China that\u2019s really a stumbling block for execution over there right now. And you have a post-pandemic surge in global container movements. I\u2019ve heard experts from container lines and railroads say they just have too much product for the resources they have. You also have this impact of the \u201cgreat resignation.\u201d No one seems to be able hire anybody for anything.\u00a0\n\nWG: India recently announced plans to become a larger wheat exporter, only to turn around days later and announce a limit on wheat exports. Do you see India eventually being a significant importer of wheat?\u00a0\n\nHaarmann: I don\u2019t see that happening, in part because as they pushed increasingly toward self-sufficiency and not being an importer, they managed to increase production and have net surpluses but only managed to do that with an incredibly high domestic procurement price. So, they\u2019re always paying the farmer to grow above the world price. They can\u2019t really export without subsidizing, which violates WTO obligations. They get this opportunity where the world wheat price is finally above the domestic procurement price. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re thrilled to have a chance to sell their surplus stocks, but then the double-edged sword comes back, and they can\u2019t let the world price starve their own people because they need that procurement for their public distribution systems. Right now, seeing the global price above the procurement price, they\u2019re obviously not getting the procurement from growers and the harvest they\u2019d like to see. That\u2019s where you see them come in and institute these controls, and I see it as more of a permit embargo than an absolute ban. They don\u2019t want to be the government that dishonored contracts and creates force majeure events. They want contracts to be honored and they want food to go to nations in need, not as donation but in sales. But I don\u2019t think they can allow that to strip out the core of their public distribution system.\u00a0\n\nWG: If that\u2019s the case, are there any other countries or regions that are non-traditional wheat suppliers that could enter the market and help with the current shortfall?\u00a0\n\nHaarmann: There isn\u2019t another country that has ample carryout stocks of that nature. The US, even when things are tight, has residual supplies. With the pure capitalist model, it just takes higher price to unlock those bushels. I think it\u2019s more a process of gradually replacing the market share that the US, EU and Australia, to an extent, has given to Black Sea over time and replace that back with production in those areas. That\u2019s done with price, which we are starting to see right now. Spring wheat becomes competitive with soybean pricing. Hard wheat pricing comes up to encourage more acreage. But that\u2019s a multi-year function for markets to realign what has been a decades-long drop or realignment of supply. It can\u2019t be resolved in a year or two.\u00a0\n\nWG: How is the shortage and high price of fertilizer and other crop inputs playing a role in the volatility?\u00a0\n\nHaarmann: That\u2019s a challenge globally. The pure price metrics globally have impacted a lot of marginal acres in a lot of areas where we need them to be in full production to make up for some of this shortfall. On the most productive ground under the best conditions, these grain price increases still outweigh the input costs increases, so there\u2019s still a net benefit from the higher grain prices. But as you get into marginal acres, that\u2019s where you start to see a disincentive involving price. There are also fertilizer availability issues; there are certain places in the world where it is not available. It all impacts the ability to rebuild stocks because nothing happens on a spreadsheet \u2014 it comes down to the actual physical planting and harvesting of crops. You can dial it in a spreadsheet that way, but you still have to put the tractor in the field.\u00a0\n\nWG: How has this combination of challenges impacted Columbia Grain\u2019s operations? What strategies have you employed to combat this unprecedented situation?\u00a0\n\nHaarmann: It\u2019s a tremendous challenge. Columbia Grain is focused on cultivating growth. That\u2019s our mantra. We have to be disciplined in our approach to markets. Both our customers and grower suppliers need us to be a consistent part of that supply chain. Our growers need us to be there for their offtake and provide risk management tools and our buyers need us for reliable delivery. The international market has seen ebbs and flows and problems with Black Sea delivery in the past, either related to a global supply shock, drought, et cetera, so they have some experience with it. But our buyers more consistently are able to rely on the US system for really solid supplies. I\u2019d say it has probably impacted our processed product lines more than our bulk product lines. Certainly, pricing has been impacted in our bulk product lines. There have been some railroad service issues and much higher ocean freight costs. All of those things have impacted our bulk customers. But it\u2019s been an order of magnitude higher for our processed product lines because that typically is going to happen in single car shipments, containers and truck load shipments when it comes to our domestic customers, and these really exaggerated freight rates in container shipping for our overseas customers. We have doubled down being disciplined in how we go ... (truncated)",

        "text":"Business Today\n\nApparel industry is shifting base from China, creating a potential market of $280 billion for other countries: Ratika Jain of CII\n\nRatika Jain, Executive Director, Manufacturing, CII talks to Business Today's Sarika Malhotra about how India is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing global apparel opportunity.\n\ntwitter-logo\u00a0Sarika Malhotra\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Last Updated:\u00a0January 25, 2017 \u00a0|\u00a016:45 IST\nApparel industry is shifting base from China, creating a potential market of $280 billion for other countries: Ratika Jain of CII\n\nHow is the Indian textile sector placed?\nIndia has the ecosystem from fibre to fashion, both in cotton and man-made fibre, an abundant and young labour force, a vibrant domestic market and a good second largest exporter of textiles, apparel and made-ups in the world. Currently, the imports into India for apparel, made-up and textile items are low but there are specific segments where they are growing rapidly. These include Moisture Management Fabric (MMF) and technical textiles. As wage cost is rising and Yuan gaining strength, apparel industry is shifting base from China, creating a potential market of $280 plus billion for other countries. India is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nWhat are the big issues that the sector is facing?\nThere are key challenges which need to be addressed. Setting and scaling up: the textile sector was traditionally reserved for Small Scale Industries (SSIs) de-reserved in late 2000 year. The largest Indian apparel and made-ups factory will employ 3000-4000 people, large Chinese factories employ over 10,000 people at one place. Some even go up to 30,000 people. Significant attempts have been made to increase the scale in Indian industry but the key issues revolve around - labour, land and building, enabling infrastructure such as power and connectivity. Unfavourable labour environment: The fear of managing large number of employees has dissuaded several enterprises from growing. Some states have introduced progressive reforms to benefit the industry, still majority are far from adopting progressive reforms. The biggest capital cost components for an apparel factory are the land and building costs which is more than 50 per cent. Issues related to land acquisitions have deterred entrepreneurs from venturing into large scale manufacturing. Our clusters are fragmented and lack clear positioning in the minds of Buyers.\n\nHigh operating cost: It has two aspects. The cost side pressures such as - tax, power, wage, wage increases and other is labour productivity. The sector is highly labour intensive. The wage cost can go up from 6 to 8 per cent of the overall cost base in yarn to as high as 30-40 per cent in the case of apparel. Synthetic value chain is very poor despite huge raw material base. The lack of local fabric availability at the right quality and at competitive prices leads us to resort to importing MMF fabrics.\u00a0 Such imports result in loss of drawback on exports of apparel made from such imported fabric. Another issue is differential treatment of cotton (0) and synthetic (12.5 per cent) products in terms of excise duty. Energy cost is higher in Gujarat and Maharashtra compared to rest of the country, where fabric and yarn production is concentrated. Labour productivity is poor than countries like Bangladesh, mainly due to poor working conditions, insufficient training and high attrition rates. Market barriers: Higher duty on synthetics and lower drawbacks as compared to competitors is another major factor. This make synthetic segment uncompetitive. The cost disadvantage ranges from 2 to 11 per cent. China has maximum VAT rebate for textile and apparel exporters of 17 per cent, whereas India allows a drawback of around 7-11 per cent. Trade barriers is another issue. Logistic Challenges: both in domestic and export markets logistics is a challenge. Be it land ports (ex. Petrapole) or sea ports (JNPT) customs procedures and clearances take more time than other countries. India suffers 2-3 week disadvantage against China and one week gap against Vietnam on logistics. Investment and financing entrepreneurship is an issue: TUFS is an important scheme by government but its benefits has gone towards the spinning sector.\u00a0 As time to market is important in fashion industry, Indian manufacturers are not able to complete as cost of working capital is high. Indian Manufacturers are not able to stock up fabric for upward processing as compared to China & Vietnam. India takes on an average 63 days from placement of PO till shipment from Mill. While china takes 31 days and Vietnam takes 46 days. Lack of investment in knit technology and other latest processing technology.\nWhere do you think India needs to catch up to be a global market leader?\nFirstly, build scale to suit the fabric of Indian society, as the industry is highly labour intensive, introduce flexible labour laws; job linked support schemes, innovative hub and spoke models for apparel\/textile parks to employ labour in hinterlands and introduce PPP models for Industry to provide scale and create jobs. In India, share of companies with revenue more than 200 million is 3 per cent while in China it is 14 per cent and in Bangladesh it is 7 per cent. Secondly, bridge the operating cost gap, especially on synthetics. Entrepreneurs need to aggressively drive up productivity by investing in world class facilities, process improvements and build a culture of manufacturing excellence. Simplified tax structures and neutral implementation of GST for both cotton and synthetic products will give the much required boost to the industry. Thirdly, infrastructure, especially at ports, import facilities and clearance procedures should be streamlined to cut turnaround times.\n\nSigning FTAs with major markets like the European Union can equalise market access positions with key competitors like Bangladesh. Bangladesh has zero duty access to EU, Vietnam is on its way, India has 10 per cent duty, while China has 12 per cent duty on cotton shirt. Fourthly, increased investments in technology, especially processing and technical textiles either through capital subsidy or technology partnerships. The A-TUFS released in December 2015 has taken welcome steps in this respect. Fifthly, Indian entrepreneurs need to invest both financial and human resources on technology and innovation to address the constantly evolving markets. Investments are required in technical textiles, processing, and apparel making in particular. India needs to create its own 'silicon-valleys' for technical textiles, with a full ecosystem of investors, start-ups, production facilities and ultra-fast clearances. Ease of doing business is equally critical for innovation.\n\nWhich segment within the textile supply chain is the weakest? And what can be done to boost it?\nFabric and processing are the weakest segments of the value chain. However, need is to provide end to end solution for the entire value chain.\u00a0 Global brands like PVH, H&M, GAP etc see India's end to end ecosystem as one of our value propositions in replacing China. In order to strengthen the value chain, synthetics industry needs support in the form of GST neutral rates for cotton\/MMF; synthetic fiber should be available at international rates, power cost rationalization; global competitiveness, drawback scheme similar to China under GST; adjust export drawback in the interim to reflect state taxes\u00a0 (depends on final drawback rates notified by Government); capital cost rationalization.\n\nThough India is a leader in the yarn space, where and how does it lose the edge in the processing and fabric stage?\nThe processing and fabric segments are highly fragmented and comprising of SSIs. China is a leading in fabric exports globally, accounting for over 45 per cent of all global fabric exports in 2014. India is relatively poor in knits category due to lack of technology and investment, while global market is moving towards knit category. The imports of knit fabric is rising rapidly, which needs to be curtailed through better sufficiency in these segments which can be achieved by strong processing facilities in India. In apparels, India's domestic and global position in apparel has been relatively strong compared more developed economies but has underperformed peers like Bangladesh, and Vietnam who have seen growth rates of over 18% per annum over the last five years compared to India which has averaged 9 per cent in most categories. India's competing countries are having duty free access in major markets, USA and EU. This make Indian textile products highly uncompetitive in these markets.\n\nThe cabinet has approved the new textile package\u2026 how do you think it will benefit the textile supply chain?\nThe special package announced recently is expected to boost competency of textile and apparel exports in international markets. The seasonal flexibility i.e. increases in overtime limit from 50 hours to 100 hours and introduction to fixed term employment are already addressed by Government in the special package. This will help the sector to attain scale of production.\n\nWith EPF scheme reforms and overtime caps, introduction of fixed term employment, additional incentives under TUFs, industry will be encouraged to increase scale and capacity.\nEnhanced duty drawback will encourage competitiveness of Indian exports in foreign markets. It is equally important to protect the entire value chain. Spinning, weaving, processing sector are the key segments of the value chain which is supplying raw material to the apparel sector. Supporting these segments will benefit the entire textile and apparel industry to attain competitiveness.\n\n\n  \u2022 Print\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A",

        "text":"Interview with Adriana Santanocito & Enrica Arena\n\nAdriana Santanocito & Enrica Arena\nAdriana Santanocito & Enrica Arena\nCEO & Co-Founder and CMO & Co-Founder respectively\nOrange Fiber\nOrange Fiber\n\nIs it possible to produce printed orange fibre fabric in the future?\n\nAS & EA: Our fabrics can be printed either using inkjet techniques or screen printing. The precious designs that the Italian designer Mario Trimarchi has created for the Ferragamo Orange Fibre Collection made with our sustainable fabrics by Salvatore Ferragamo have been printed on our fabric, so they show exactly the final effect of printing on our material.\n\nHow has been the response from users? Why should a consumer opt for this fabric or a dress designed using this fabric? How do you see its fashion score?\n\nAS & EA: From a brand perspective, we can say that our innovative and sustainable approach applied to the textiles and fashion industry, together with the high quality of our unique fabrics and the possibilities of using them as \"normal\" material, have caught the interest of designers and production managers. From a consumer angle, we focus on providing information of our supply chain and of the values we believe in, matching them again with a high-quality product developed for their comfort.\u00a0\n\nThe very first fashion collection made with our exclusive fabric was launched on the occasion of the Earth Day on April 22 by Salvatore Ferragamo-among Italy's top fashion brands and world leader in the luxury industry-in a collaboration that represents the shared ethical values underlying the project, shaping the fabric and showcasing its potential for elegant and sustainable applications.\u00a0\n\nBroadly speaking, the project is catching more and more the interest and the appreciation of fashion industry, as showed by the recent agreement that sees Orange Fiber as a portfolio company of FTL Venture, the global venture capital fund founded by prominent fashion and digital entrepreneur and investor Miroslava Duma that helps new technologies and sustainable innovations create products and brands to evolve the fashion industry and help reduce its social and environmental footprint.\n\nWhat about the high costs? How do you bring it down?\n\nAS & EA: While proving the market viability of our textile with the first capsule collection made by Ferragamo and developing new potential collaborations, we are also completing the research and development process aiming to optimise the costs of production, scaling up the technology and eventually replicating the technology in Italy and abroad. Italy produces just four per cent of world citrus juice, so that the opportunity to replicate the process is endless and which would allow us to lower the product price, becoming competitive with alternative and more polluting materials such as polyester and cotton.\n\nHow far have you progressed? I understand you presented the fabric at an expo in Milan. What comes next?\n\nAS &amp; EA: Following a collaboration with Politecnico di Milano University back in 2012, we developed a process to create a fabric using the leftovers of the citrus transformation industry, valuing just in Italy more than one million tonne a year, that otherwise would have to be disposed of.\n\nWe have patented and produced an innovative fabric from citrus waste, thus working on establishing the product as a recognisable and added value material, apt to be used for different textile blends. We have registered the trademark and established partners through the supply chain in the yarn and textile industry.\n\nThanks to the funding by Seed Money of Trentino Sviluppo (Granted funding on the operational programme FESR 2007-2013 of the Provincia Autonoma di Trento and the support of European Regional Development Fund) and private investors, in 2014 on the occasion of Vogue Fashion's Night Out we presented the first prototypes of our fabrics.\n\nIn December 2015 - thanks to the funding by Smart&amp;Start Invitalia (Ministero Sviluppo Economico) - we have opened our first pilot plant in Sicily to enjoy savings in product logistic and to produce the material for our first order.\n\nThe first fashion collection made with our exclusive fabric has been recently presented by Salvatore Ferragamo and we have officially entered the operational phase of the project.\n\nSince we strongly believe that \"the future is not a place we're going to, but a place we create,\" we will continue our research &amp; development on our products and new raw materials, working on industrial scale-up and improving our process according to circular economy principles.\n\nOur aim is to establish Orange Fiber as the Italian first mover into sustainable textiles industry through a \"green\" production from renewable sources, representing a valid and more sustainable alternative to traditional textiles from wood-of which demand is estimated to increase (due to oil and cotton price volatility) -and contributing to create a greener fashion industry.\n\nWe will continue to invest in innovation because we believe that it is crucial in the industry's products, supply chains, and business practices as in consumers' habits and behaviour.\n\nHow do you see the relevance of this technology for a country like India?\n\nAS & EA: According to a research conducted by the Italian FAO-Food and Agriculture Organisation-in 2012, India ranked fourth in citrus fruit production and generated about 7.8 million tonnes of waste annually while world average is about 119.7 million tonnes.\nOur innovative process not only can contribute to reduce the cost and the environmental impact of citrus waste disposal, but it can also contribute to develop a sustainable textile industry in India, with obvious advantages for the local economy.\nPublished on: 18\/08\/2017\n\nDISCLAIMER: All views and opinions expressed in this column are solely of the interviewee, and they do not reflect in any way the opinion of\n\nF2F NewsLetter\n\nSubscribe today and get the latest information on Textiles, Fashion, Apparel.\n\n\u00a0Fibre2Fashion Monthly Newsletter\n\u00a0Upcoming Trade fairs & Events Monthly\n\u00a0F2F Weekly Insights\n\u00a0Technical Textiles eNews Weekly\n\u00a0 Please refer our Privacy Policy before submitting your information",

        "text":"Interview with Mario Marsili, 39 years old\nsuccessor of the founding father Aldo Marsili\n\nWe interviewed Mario Marsili, a young entrepreneur frorn the Marche, currently running the company founded by his father Aldo whose name it bears. Many customers saw in him the humility that characterises the great personalities of Italy\u2019s small but enterprising industries\n\n\u00a0Journalist:\u00a0Has your family always been involved in this sector?\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0My father\u2019s uncles started with\u00a0the first agricultural engines,\u00a0and in the plumbing field\u00a0they designed a local fountain\u00a0with a lever mechanism; then\u00a0naturally the first motorboats\u00a0gave a boost to their activity;\u00a0my father assembled and tested\u00a0engines for fishing boats; he\u00a0told me he got to know a lot of\u00a0people but the work was very\u00a0tiring; his motto, \u00abremember\u00a0you must collaborate with\u00a0everyone\u00bb, fascinated me since I was a child: the simplicity\u00a0with which he managed\u00a0our collaborators and how\u00a0he managed to get the best\u00a0collaboration setting an\u00a0example in first person.\n\n\u00a0Journalist:\u00a0How did you pass from engines to steering gear?\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0It seems like a fairytale! My father liked to listen and to read; he listened to the fishermen who said \u00abAt the helm it\u2019s\u00a0too tiring, and the helmsman\u00a0can\u2019t follow the\u00a0fishing, it\u2019s like being a man short!\n\nMy father knew of companies in northern Europe that produced steering gear, but it was expensive to import and there was not much written about it.\n\n\u00a0Around the mid-50s a friend of his who had a fishing boat brought up in the net a watertight box\u00a0from the sea bottom. In it were books on hydraulic systems in submarines. He gave it to my father who had the books translated bit by bit and read and studied them all,\u00a0under the stairs of the family farmhouse at the end of his working day he experimented using drawings in the books,\u00a0verifying in person what they said.\n\n\u00a0Under the same stairs in 1957 the Oleodinamica Marsili Civitanova Marche company was created, and the production of hydraulic\u00a0steering gear systems for fishing boats began.\u00a0In those days they all used\u00a0mechanical steering gear.\n\n\u00a0I never found out whether the first product ended up on his friend\u2019s fishing boat, maybe\u00a0as a free prototype probably.\n\nHe often went out on fishing boats to check the system in person and modify it, sometimes to meet requests from the fishermen, real feedback from the customer that we still use.\n\nJournalist:\u00a0The company has a different name now?\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0My father started out with an Autobianchi Bianchina, supplies and deliveries followed personally all along the Adriatic coast, in Sicily and in some parts\u00a0of the Tyrrhenian; the car was cleaned up for use on Sundays.\n\n\u00a0With his simple \u201cyou need to collaborate\u201d philosophy he let his collaborators propose\u00a0new ideas and technological solutions, but he asked them to test whether they worked\u00a0and develop them to make production increasingly competitive.\n\nIn the mid-70s came the first \u00ecndustr\u00ecal factory, traditional semi automatic machines, honing\u00a0and grinding machines, a welding department,\u00a0work shop, lathes and milling machines, an assembly\u00a0department with a test bench, the dispatch department with hoists and a huge overhead crane.\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Then my father invested in \u201cMarsili Aldo\u201d, a one-man business that had already\u00a0made its mark in the fishing sector and was expanding into yachts and Superyachts; in\u00a01978 he exhibited at the Genoa boat show for the first time.\n\nAt the beginning of the 80s, a young technical staff and the first CNC lathe made their\u00a0mark in production; the design office collaborated with the\u00a0leading Italian naval design studios and with leading shipyards. The company was\u00a0destined to become a leader in the large yacht and sailing yacht sector, in work boats,\u00a0merchant and military vessels, and then the pleasure boat sector.\n\n\u00a0Journalist:\u00a0So everything was going well?\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Well, the economic crisis at the start of the 90s created problems, but at the time\u00a0my father was aiming to save\u00a0everyone\u2019s jobs and went personally abroad, to Spain, Algeria, Tunisy, Morocco and northern France where\u00a0the penetration\u00a0of our products\u00a0on fishing boats was very strong, he even went as far as Venezuela. The Marsili\u00a0Aldo company is the only one in the sector that is Italian, in all these years it has relied\u00a0solely on its own production, design and managerial capacity. My father invested in\u00a0more CNC machines, without borrowing from the banks.\n\n\u00a0In 1992 he visited the METS Show in Amsterdam, and came back enthusiastic, he talked a lot with the design and production departments.\u00a0Here I felt I had found out what I would do when I grew up.\n\n\u00a0Journalist:\u00a0Carry on your father\u2019s work?\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I started alongside the\u00a0workmen with encouragement\u00a0instead of\u00a0wages, getting my hands\u00a0dirty on all the machines,\u00a0working with everyone, and\u00a0my father drove me hard,\u00a0saying \u00abyou\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll\u00a0learn\u00bb: he was inflexible on the job but at home acted like a father, and from him I\u00a0learned curiosity, the thirst for knowledge and respect for\u00a0people.\n\n\u00a0In the design office I\u00a0drew\u00a0by hand\u00a0\u00a0with set squares,\u00a0sometimes the designers let me use the drawing board,\u00a0sometimes they backed my\u00a0ideas ar solutions. I went with them to the trade fairs, I saw the continual flow of\u00a0technicians and engineers\u00a0from important yards, all for medium to large boats.\n\n\u00a0The slice of the market occupied\u00a0by pleasure boats, although\u00a0there were good customers,\u00a0was small; we had some good\u00a0products but we saw them as\u00a0just completing our range.\n\n\u00a0I realised that I needed to\u00a0make this sector grow. I\u00a0pushed the\u00a0production towards\u00a0the only market sector where\u00a0we were weak, I got a taste for improving products and enlarging the range of\u00a0hydraulic cylinders, also from\u00a0an aesthetic point of view\u00a0using anticorrosion materials,\u00a0stainless steel for the rods,\u00a0brass for the cylinders, bronze\u00a0for the cylinder heads and\u00a0supports.\n\n\u00a0Let\u2019s say it was my personal contribution to\u00a0the growth of what was by\u00a0now Marsili Aldo & C. S.r.l.; certainly I was always by my father\u2019s side, day by day he transmitted to me his\u00a0experience, believing in what\u00a0I was doing and making me\u00a0realise I could continue on the\u00a0path I had chosen. My father\u00a0was by my side until the last\u00a0day of his life.\n\n\u00a0Journalist:\u00a0Tell me about your special production\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0In the 80s we perfected the FolIow-Up hydraulic\u00a0system, adopting the master-slave concept between the\u00a0motor on the bridge and the\u00a0electrical pump unit, using\u00a0also proportional distributors\u00a0we had specialIy designed and\u00a0prepared, and in some cases\u00a0manufactured. We designed\u00a0a centralised unit with the\u00a0hydraulic components already\u00a0installed and connected,\u00a0tested and ready to be\u00a0installed on board, as if it were\u00a0a normal electrical panel, and\u00a0this saved shipyards a lot of\u00a0money. We were the first to\u00a0use electric steering pumps in\u00a0Load-Sensing to save energy,\u00a0the absorbtion of the electric motors is in function to the\u00a0torque required by the rudder\u00a0shaft.\n\n\u00a0We have made bushed and roller bearing rudder\u00a0supports, steering systems\u00a0complete with rudder post\u00a0trunk, garage doors and even\u00a0lifts for motoryachts that could\u00a0load and unload a Rolls-Royce;\u00a0almost all the motor yachts built in the Adriatic use our\u00a0equipment, in the Tyrrhenian\u00a0many sailing yachts use our\u00a0steering gear. In the medium-\u00a0sized merchant ship sector;\u00a0also\u00a0ferries and motorboats for the\u00a0Venetian lagoon and lakes;\u00a0military support and war ships.\u00a0We do all we can to favour\u00a0ltalian commerc\u00ecal products.\n\n\u00a0Journalist:\u00a0The pride of your current production?\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0A large series of hydraulic cylinders for all kinds of\u00a0vessels, a series of manual\u00a0pumps to be used rationally\u00a0taking in to account the speed and\u00a0easiness of the manoeuvre,\u00a0the reliability of hydraulic seals\u00a0adopting double seals with a\u00a0low coefficient of friction on\u00a0the rods, stainless steel rods\u00a0surface chromed to eliminate any damage from corrosion or\u00a0worse from galvanic current.\n\n\u00a0We have a huge assortment of\u00a0electrohydraulic units with\u00a0Autopilot\/On-Off Joystick control.\n\n\u00a0For some years we have been\u00a0supplying the leading producers\u00a0and distributors of autopilots;\u00a0we also produce units for\u00a0handling gangways and flaps.\n\n\u00a0Journalist:\u00a0What sets you apart?\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0None of our customers, from\u00a0the smallest to the largest, is\u00a0ever neglected. Rapid delivery\u00a0is a point of pride for me, and I assure you that it requires\u00a0organisational and economic\u00a0commitment.\n\n\u00a0Our flexibility is recognized by our best\u00a0customers, and it is made as competitive and reliable in designing and producing\u00a0custom steering gear for any\u00a0vessel, large or small. We are\u00a0continually contacted by naval\u00a0design studios to collaborate on\u00a0projects.\n\n\u00a0Journalist:\u00a0And for the future?\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0About a decade ago we\u00a0perfected the electric Follow-\u00a0Up system, in line with the\u00a0hydraulic system, using all our\u00a0know-how for the hydraulic\u00a0power units and collaborating\u00a0with partners under our\u00a0direction we perfected the Full Follow-Up system which\u00a0got us known also in the on\u00a0board automation sector; we\u00a0supplied interface units for Dynamic Positioning on vessels\u00a0serving offshore oil platforms.\n\n\u00a0Then our design department\u00a0has produced the pride of our\u00a0products: we were the first to develop a special steering\u00a0system for Sailor Yachts, \u2018Tactile\u00a0Feedback\u2019, which was created\u00a0and tested on our test benches\u00a0with qualified partners who\u00a0were interested enough to join\u00a0our pioneering venture. This\u00a0system allows you to\u00a0steer a large\u00a0sailing yacht and\u00a0feel feedback\u00a0on the wheel; the helmsman is\u00a0no longer a motoryacht captain\u00a0but a true skipper who trims the sails and sets the course\u00a0according to the pressure he\u00a0feels on the wheel. This pressure\u00a0can be adjusted and adapted to\u00a0the demands of the skipper.\n\n\u00a0Journalist:\u00a0So Tactile Feedback is something new?\n\n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Yes, new but already produced\u00a0and working to the satisfaction\u00a0of our customer and the owner.\n\n\u00a0In fact it was an idea the design\u00a0office had been treasuring for\u00a0years, it had been talked over at\u00a0length between my father and\u00a0the designer. I was just starting\u00a0out and I listened dreaming of the day we would mak... (truncated)",
