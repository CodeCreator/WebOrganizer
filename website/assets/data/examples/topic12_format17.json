I finally saw my husband after a long air force basic process on Oct 13-16 in which we had sex with protection. I did not get my period for the rest of that month. (Stress related maybe? but i have irregular periods)\nI saw him again Nov 10-13 which we slept together without protection. I got my period Nov 23-27 and we slept together even then on the lighter days of it without protection.\nI have been super sick to my stomach, have these shooting back pains, Headaches that could knock a person down. i am sick allll through the night, two days ago i started cramping a little bit and it feels like a water balloon is in my belly except for around my belly button in which its kinda hard... My husband and I have been through many phantom pregnancies with our baby fever and I am in denial. I have to wait about 6 more days to get an accurate test but I just wanted some opinions from someone other than friends that just want us to have a baby! (:\nthank you kindly.\n\nDecember 13, 2011 - 7:19am\nEmpowHER Guest\nAnonymous (reply to Anonymous)\n\nAlso to add to the above comment from me...\ni have had some diarrhea and then went to being able to use the bathroom but like i couldn't push.. and now back to diarrhea. i know that's TMI but i just want to see opinions. Six days is a long ways away for something so precious like this and all opinions are appreciated. <3\n\nDecember 13, 2011 - 7:33am\n\nThe only way to know if she is pregnant is to wait. If she misses her period, she should take a home pregnancy test.\n\nIn the future, use a condom when you are engaging in any sort of sexual activity.\u00a0 Pre-cum can contain sperm left from a prior ejaculation.\u00a0 The vagina is the tube in the woman's body in which you insert your penis. The labia is the outer part of the woman's genitalia.\n\nRubbing against your girlfriend's labia with your penis that might have sperm on it can be a way, though not very likely but possible, of getting her pregnant.\n\nDecember 7, 2011 - 6:51pm\nEmpowHER Guest\n\nSo i rubbed my penis against my girlfriends vagina, and i dont know if the was any pre-cum in my penis. It's been 4 days since and her stomach is strting to feel weird. Do you think she might be pregnant?\n\nDecember 6, 2011 - 7:19pm\n\nI want to try to put your mind at ease.\n\nThe warning signs of a miscarriage are mild to severe back pain (often worse than menstrual cramps), weight loss, a vaginal discharge with \u00a0white-pink mucus, painful contractions that happen every 5 to 20 minutes or brown or bright red bleeding with or without cramps. Tissue with clot like material passes through the vagina.\n\nIf your period is late by at least one week or you have missed a period completely, take another home pregnancy test. Test first thing in the morning when your urine is concentrated. Follow the directions exactly to get accurate results.\n\nBest of Luck,\n\n\nDecember 6, 2011 - 6:02pm\n\n\nStomach pain can be a symptom of, but not limited to,\u00a0stomach flu, indigestion, gas or food poisoning.\n\nIf you took the pregnancy test correctly ( at the correct time and followed the directions ) and you got a negative test result, then you are not pregnant.\n\nSome women notice a slight bulging of the lower abdomen before the start of their periods.\n\nIf your period is late by a week or more and you have had unprotected sex, then, take another pregnancy test or have a blood pregnancy test done.\n\nIf you have not missed a period, but still have stomach pain and are concerned about the increase size of your abdomen, make an appointment with your physician to be evaluated.\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 2011 - 6:12pm\n(reply to Maryann Gromisch RN)\n\noh thank you you know it feels like stomach is in knotts. like constantly . i have never had a miscarriage but feels like its developing.so in morning im gonna take another test or is there a test i can take this late in evening .\n\nDecember 5, 2011 - 7:38pm\nEnter the characters shown in the image.\nBy submitting this form, you agree to EmpowHER's terms of service and privacy policy\nAdd a Comment\n\nAll user-generated information on this site is the opinion of its author only and is not a substitute for medical advice or treatment for any medical conditions.

I pulled a tendon in my left knee a few weeks ago and pain was minimal. I also slammed into another player in a game with my other knee and there was bruising and pain. Now whenever I run there is pain in both knees and whenever I extend my legs,they pop(it's audible) and there it is painful. I tried working out on a stationary bike but it hurt too badly. What is wrong?\n\n3 Answers\n\n  \u2022 1 decade ago\n    Favorite Answer\n\n    I've had that and still get the popping sounds. It can be fluid around the knee and then the cartlidge is usually what causes the popping sounds or a torn ligament which I had also. It gets aggravated. Elevate it, ice it, rest it. If not better soon see a Dr. I did and I ended up needing surgery because I tore the meniscus in my right knee. All just by stepping down wrong on a step & twisting it. Ouchhhh\n\n    Hope it doesn't come to that for you so please take care of it.\n\n    The recommended treatment for a hurt patella depends primarily upon whether it is an acute injury or a chronic condition.\n\n    A. ) Acute Injury: If the hurt knee cap is the result of an acute injury, then it will be treated with ice and you may be asked to stay off your leg and wear a brace when walking to keep the knee straight. The stability that these supports can help provide can be meaningful because they help to keep the knee's structural integrity protected and aligned properly. - (Moreover, it is important to always speak with your physician when you any acute injury.)\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous\n    5 years ago\n\n    go to a knee dr and get ur knee checked out\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous\n    1 decade ago\n\n    that is so cool!!\n\nStill have questions?

I hope you and she are enjoying a wonderful breastfeeding relationship.\n\nMedical experts recommend that mothers avoid contraceptive pills containing estrogen for at least the first 2 months postpartum, but it may be best to avoid them until a baby\/child is completely weaned. Estrogen-containing contraceptives have been found to reduce the amount of protein in mothers` milk, and they have been associated with sudden, and sometimes severe, decreases in milk production. However, the longer a mother waits to use this type of hormonal contraception, the less effect it seems to have on breastfeeding and lactation.\n\nProgestin-only contraceptives seem to have little effect on breastfeeding and lactation, especially if they are begun after the first 6 to 8 weeks postpartum. Because there have been some reports of decreased milk production with progestin-only contraceptives, a \"trial run\" with a progestin-only pill may be a good idea before using a longer-acting progestin-only form of contraception, such as a Depo-Provera injection or Norplant. If there is any problem with milk production when taking a pill, it can be easily stopped so there is less chance of a long-term effect on milk supply. (A woman taking progestin-only contraceptive pills should be aware that a missed pill is associated with a greater risk of pregnancy than with a contraceptive pill that also contains estrogen.)\n\nIf you are concerned that the estrogen or progestin hormones in any type of hormonal contraceptive may be harmful for your baby, studies have shown that only low amounts of these hormones are in mothers` milk and they appear to have no effect on babies.\n\n\nHale, TW (1999).

        "text":"I really want to quit smoking, but I'm anticipating one major obstacle that I know won't be easy to overcome: My husband smokes, and he has no intention of quitting. How can I avoid cravings when he and I are together?\n\n\u2014 Christine, Florida\n\nThe key to success is having a plan. You're thinking ahead, which shows that you are ready to take the necessary steps to successfully take charge of your health \u2014 good for you!\n\nGetting help from your loved ones can make a huge difference. It starts with open and honest communication. Sit down with your husband and tell him what you hope to achieve. Ask him how he might see himself helping you. He might surprise you and offer to change his smoking habits around you. If not, try explaining to him that his smoking might trigger a relapse. He may offer not to smoke when you're around or he may make any number of other helpful compromises. If you like, you can make specific requests, like \"Would you be willing not to smoke in the car when I am with you?\" or \"Could you warn me before you light up so I can go to the other room?\" There is no one solution for everyone, but by openly expressing your needs, and making requests, you can initiate a helpful conversation and negotiate some solutions.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that when someone else struggles with nicotine addiction, it may be difficult or impossible for him or her to change in every way you need. Try not to personalize or generalize this. All too often people's thoughts run toward things like \"If you loved me, you'd do this.\" It really isn't about you or how much the person cares for you. When people are unable to change their behavior, it is probably about their own issues \u2014 in this case, with smoking. We can't always expect others to change to suit our needs, on our timetable.\n\nUltimately, it is up to you to remove yourself from situations that put you at risk for smoking and take charge of your own health. Who knows? Maybe your example will help your husband cut down or quit too!",

Aches in both sides of my pelvis and both sides of my mid to upper back. Well to cut a LONG story short, after seeing a Urogynaecologist today (29\/01\/13), he more or less stated in no uncertain terms that I did not have a kidney problem in the slightest... he based this on 2 ultrasounds I've had done in the past which came back normal. He more or less blatantly refused to do anything for me, but I managed to get him to order a kidney function blood test. I also have 125+ Leukocytes in my urine as of today, which again the Urogynaecologist doesn't seem to think is anything (despite overcoming a kidney infection in December 2012) but yet again I somehow managed to convince him to send it off for a urine culture. Honestly it was like getting blood out of a stone. Actually that would be a lot easier!\n\nMy concern is in reference to the bilateral upper (thoracic) back pain \/ shoulder and arm pain I\u2019m currently experiencing on a daily basis. I cannot lie on my left side whatsoever and only temporarily on the right. It feels like a constant heavy dull ache in all areas, and sometimes the pain can just hit me like a shockwave in the mid to upper back (again both sides).\n\nFor this reason after pretty much cancelling out the possibility of a kidney problem based on an ultrasound (because obviously there the be all and end all) do you think it could well be a problem with my spine or something? Maybe I should go back to my GP (again) and somehow convince him to refer me to a back specialist... Please somebody help!\n\n\nAdd a Comment2 Comments\n\n\nHi Susan,\n\nThanks for replying. I think I will definately pursue the possibility of a spinal\/back problem. I'm just not sure what sort of specialist to prompt the doctor with, is it more of an orthopedist?\n\nOne other thing, do you think tingling sensations (pins and needles) in my back, particularly around the areas I feel pain could also be a sign of a spinal\/back problem? (maybe a blessing in disguise).\n\nThankyou again!\n\nJanuary 30, 2013 - 5:30am\nSusan Cody HERWriter Guide\n\nHi Rachel!\n\nSorry to read you are in so much pain.\n\nIf your doctor has tested you and is convinced your kidney's are fine, then let's go with that for now.\n\nYou may have spinal issues, or hip issues. Pain can radiate out to other areas of the body. I'm not sure seeing a chiropractor right now is the best thing but it certainly can't hurt. However, if you are at the point where your pain is stopping you from lying on each side, then I think asking to see a different doctor with more testing is a good idea.\n\nAsk your PCP who she would recommend. With pain on both sides, there are too many variables to contemplate what it could be.\n\nPlease keep us posted.\n\n\n\nJanuary 29, 2013 - 2:00pm\nEnter the characters shown in the image.\nBy submitting this form, you agree to EmpowHER's terms of service and privacy policy\n\nAll user-generated information on this site is the opinion of its author only and is not a substitute for medical advice or treatment for any medical conditions.

        "text":"Premarin dosage\n\nCommon Questions and Answers about Premarin dosage\n\n\nIt took me several months for my cycle to return and I was then put on Premarin. What dosage of Premarin are you on? My dosage is .625 per day. Hope things get better for you......\nI would like to know if there is an over the counter remedy for my night sweats and other sysmtoms. I have been on Premarin since 2001, very low dosage, I looked into Amberen but you have to buy this online. I no longer have insurance and Premairn is just to expensive. So can you suggest something else.Thank You.\nHe asked how I was doing on the premarin, and I told him that I did take it for 3 days, but it made me have bad heart palpitations, and that when I got it from the pharm. that they said that it was a higher dosage than normally given. Internet says that the standard dosage is .625mg, but was given 1.25mg. The doctor said that it is not a high dose, that the amount of estrogen that you get from the birth control pill is 5x higher than you get in premarin.\nMy hot flashes were up to 13 per day, prior to the premarin. This dosage of premarin seems to be the least I can take, and ward off the hot flashes, and night sweats. Any suggestions? Thanks so much!\n3, but now my doctor wants to continue to lower my dosage of Levoxyl. In trying to decide if that is a good idea, I've been wondering what could cause the continual ups and (mostly) downs in the TSH level? Any input would be appreciated.\nwhat is the normal dosage for premarin vaginal cream?\nThe dosage has been lowered from .6 to .325. Can I stop taking Premarin and, if so, what are the consequences?\nThanks for getting back with me. I have been reading about Premarin and it can likely cause the problem. I would like to get off Premarin and take a natural hormone replacement, or should I stay on the Premarin. What do you think about that and just how do I do that? I know I shouldn't just quit taking it suddenly.\nFor the last 18 or so years, the premarin dosage was .3 mg\/day. Because of the HRT scare and my clotting issues, my docs suggested that I ditch the premarin. I did, a year ago. The hotflashes are intolerable. They make me feel like I have to sit\/lie down or I would pass out, make it difficult to breathe, and many times, my chest feels strange (like when you've overused a muscle and it gets that spongy ticklish feeling). My blood pressure is also becoming very resistant to being brought down.\nDid the blood test route, etc., took whopping doses of Viatmin D and got put on Premarin, the lowest dose. I did not do well on that. I became actually worse, emotionally and it didn't help the sweats, irritability or anything. My doctor told me to try Estroven, and it's better, but I still feel like crap. I don't sleep well at all, I am irritable and snappish and that is NOT my personality. A friend told me she was in a similar state and took bio-identicals.\nI have no other health issues and only take a low-dosage aspirin and Premarin for hot flashes.\nTwo weeks ago, I asked my doctor to put me on HRT because of terrible mood swigns and, of course, hot flashes. She put me on Premarin 0.3mg, daily. I am still having the hot flashes (even worse than before) and the terrible mood swings. Is there a different type of HRT that works better? Also, do I only need to have estrogen replaced - or should I be getting progesterone and testosterone as well? Thank you for any advise you can offer.\nSo now I'm on Premarin .625 mg. The pain in the lower right abdomen returned as severe as before but I'm afraid to go back to doctor, as he seems so \"flip\" about this. I believe it MAY be due to constipation since I have do tend to have problems with this?? Since my hysterectomy, I have gained about 12 lbs. and have absolutely no libido & I'm wondering if the Premarin is the underlying cause of this. Are there alternative medications that might be helpful to me?\nMy TSH is 0. My T4 is 12.3. (I do take Premarin.) My T3 Uptake is 30.2. I had my right tyroid gland removed in 1983. There was a benign tumor. I used to have a 2 reading for my TSH. (I had been taking Synthroid .1 for all of these years.) At Christmas I tried Armour. I was in bed for 3 weeks with what I thought was flu. My doctor put me back on Synthroid and gave me 1.33. The subesequent test showed 1\/2 pt.TSH, so she began cutting the dosage. I am now at .\nMy doctor, who is a OB\/GYN, preformed the surgery and after placed me on Premarin. I was worried after finding out all the health issues around premerin, especially the blood clots, since my mom died of that several years after her hysterectomy. I started having very bad stinging sharp pains in my lower legs and discussed this with my doctor but he didnt take me very serious and only lowered the dosage.\nI have a prolapsed bladder and the dr. has given me a the smallest dosage of premarin cream. I hesitate to use this but do not want surgery which he agrees. I am so miserable. Thank you. Nuner This discussion is related to <a href='\/posts\/show\/660749'>I'm miserable: rubbing sensation inside vagina post surgery<\/a>.\nHi, I had a question,i used clomephene and premarin for first,my temperature rised for 5-6 days, i got my irregular periods and there was a change in my bleeding(less) this time. My question is,shall i consult my Dr. for another dosage of clomephene or wait for a month? Please advice me......\ni have pcos and i am on medication clomiphene 50 mg for 5 days from 2nd - 5th day of my cycle , premarin for 5 days 2times a day from 8th - 12th day and duphaston from 19th day for 10days. this course was for 3 months .this month is my 3rd month on medication and i am yet to get question is whether i can continue this medication for another 1 month or untill i conceive.i also want to my chances of pregnancy on this medication.\nI am not an expert at this and I hope not to have to experience it quite yet, but when my mother had a complete hysterectomy, you could not stand to be around her until they adjusted her Premarin to the level she needed. She was fine about having done so it wasn't all in head as some say happens. My mom is very easy going not illtempered, but became a close second to Linda Blair without hormone therapy.\nI am interested in taking Wellbutrin but am afraid of over-medicating myself if these are just side effects from the estrogen. Also wondering, if I lowered my dosage of Premarin to .625mg, would that help with my weight gain? Are there Dr's that specialize in hormones? Sorry for all the questions - my quality of life is so miserable right now, I think I was actually happier when I was going through chemo!\nMy doctor initially started my dosage at 20 mg, then upped the dosage to 80 (3 pills) I felt too hyper and experienced burning when urinating, so i went back to 20 mg. I have depression as well as panic attacks. I am also taking ativan 2mg and think this helps more than the prozac. I am 48 years old and am perimenopausal, taking premarin as well. I feel too medicated and want to stop the prozac. When I tried to sptop last fall, my body felt as if i had a mad itch that wouldn't go away.\nWhere on the old tests, my TSH (to check if I am receiving the right dosage) always matched the lab's norms, on this 3rd gen test, the norm is 4.0-4.5 MIU\/L and my results are 0.26 MIU\/L. I cannot find any information here (yet) regarding post-thyroidectomy and lab tests to check proper dosage of synthroid. I am 61 y.o. and have been experiencing new hair growth on my legs and arms and face. I am very tired and sometimes weak\/shaky. My skin has suddenly become very dry.\n3mg Premarin (that dosage was recently lowered from .625mg because of all the negative reports on HRT meds). What other options are available with these issues? The acid reflux and the osteoporsis medications are conflicting and there seem to be no positive long term results on any of the osteoporosis drug treatments.\nRegular doc sez its because HRT otherwise everything else ok. OBGYN increased patch to .1, then premarin .45 and then .625. Now trying compound pharmacy to create natural estrogen pills at .625 level. As dosage increased, so did the symptoms. Often take Advil to relieve symptoms. Question: since these are symptoms, should I be concerned that it could be something else? Confused and searching for answers. Thanks.\nI have not done this since I think this maybe where the lbs. come in. I also take premarin and estrogen, they, too, may play a part. I finally get to go to the rheumatologist a week from today. My physical therapy is not helping ( from my car wreck in July ) and I'm really hoping she can help with the pain, but, then again, there is the possible problem with Lyrica and weight gain. Seems I can't win for losing.\nHi Rasta, Since you say that the symptoms get worse right before you change your patch, it sounds like you either need an increased dosage, or maybe you could ask your doctor if your can change your patch a bit sooner. I use the Wisdom Menopause Formula, and I haven't had problems with vaginal dryness, but I kept my ovaries, so there's really no comparison. I'll ask some of the others I know if it has helped in those areas.\nIn the last year, I would say that the symptoms including hot flashes, have been unbearable at times and have been more frequently and more severly. He has increased the dosage since and where the hot flashes are subsiding, the mood swings are now way out of control. Watching a commercial can literally send me into a complete crying tail spin.\nI am having such severe mood swings that that the doctor put me on a low lose of premarin (I'm 54) I am still having pain\/soreness on my left side. I hope I feel better soon - I am getting quite anxious- xanax is just a temporary fix for me.\nI'm not a medical person, but I also take Premarin (for hysterectomy in l995) and Synthroid (.50 mcg). My Thyroid test fluctuate as well. Sometimes my T3Uptake is low, sometimes my T4 is high...but the TSH is always within normal ra... (truncated)",

The exact cause of these severe episodes of pain is not known, but it has been theorized that it is due to abnormal micro-motion in the degenerated disc that spurs an inflammatory reaction. In an attempt to stabilize the spine and decrease the micro-motion, the body reacts to the disc pain with muscle spasms. The reactive spasms are what make patients feel like their back has \"gone out\".\n\nJuly 28, 2011 - 5:55pm\nEnter the characters shown in the image.\nBy submitting this form, you agree to EmpowHER's terms of service and privacy policy\nAdd a Comment\n\nAll user-generated information on this site is the opinion of its author only and is not a substitute for medical advice or treatment for any medical conditions.

For some reason all the sudden she will cry loudly then sometimes pass gas other times she runs to the littler box after she uses the bathroom shes fine. I tried pin pointing where the pain is being caused and its either under her ribs or in her large bowel. I saw under her ribs because she crys if you touch when her bowels are moving...I saw her large bowel because she cries and then passes gas and the large bowel is the only thing that I think is there like...I mean there is only a very tint bit of time from when she cries and then passes gas. I broguht her to the vet they said hair balls maybe and gave me this hair ball treatment. It seemed to help but then nope it doesnt matter if I give that to her. She still cries. They gave me prescription food. Doesnt help. They did an Xray and saw nothing. :( I feel so bad for her I cant take that she is hurting.

How long has she had this problem? Did it come on suddenly?\n  2. Did you change her diet prior to these signs developing?\n  3. What type of prescription food does she have now (brand, etc)?

Has she lost any weight lately?\n\nThank you, Peter\n\nCustomer: replied\u00a03 years ago.\n\n\nThis came about 3 - 4 months ago..And yes it did come on suddenly. And I believe I did give my kitties some different food one time some months ago. I was giving them there regular stuff then one time I was too tired to go to the big grocery store so I ran into a gas station and grabbed food. But then after that was gone I gave them there normal food. She was eating .......oh crap I forgot the name of the presciption food! I did give her only the prescription food but her still cried a bit. So I just have been giving her her normal food again. Before this happened her stools were normal like as big as my pinky finger and dark brown and formed. When this problem started her stools went to watery and a light brown color and a few times I saw it yellowosh looking. And her stools are very little in amount. She used to throw up sometiems but she hasnt in a very long time. Yes she is wormed but I havent given her worm medicine in a couple months. She has lost 3 pounds from april to now. Thanks so so much for your help.\n\nExpert:\u00a0 Dr Pete replied\u00a03 years ago.\n\n\nThanks for the additional information.\n\nFrom what you describe I think you are quite correct in that this will be bowel pain, most likely the large bowel (colon). Inflammation in the colon will cause flatulence (gas), pain and usually an intermittent or consistently soft stool. When Beeba has one of these painful events she gets relief after passing a stool so that means that this is a large bowel problem. I really don\u2019t think that this will relate to hair balls. Hair balls issues in cats are common but the signs are usually vomiting or constipation. Pain is not a feature.\n\nWe need to consider as a possibility inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Her signs are reasonably consistent with this condition although we see a lot of variations. IBD is a common problem in cats. It involves inflammation of the colon (large bowel). Most commonly we get pain, diarrhoea, some vomiting and weight loss. Very often there is a history of diet change prior to the first episode. There are a number of causes including food intolerance, food allergy, infection (bacteria or protozoa) and parasites. Beeba has been wormed so that should rule out parasites.\n\nInvestigation to determine the cause can be a little protracted and expensive. The correct course of action is first to have a sample of her stool sent to a pathology lab for examination and culture to see if there is any obvious cause. Blood tests, an xray and ultrasound should be done and perhaps even a bowel biopsy. This can all get pricey! However in most cases it\u2019s reasonable to first try some simple fixes first. Diet modification is a good start. We don\u2019t know what diet she was put on but maybe it was a \u201chair ball diet\u201d\u2026that would not settle down IBD. There are a few prescription diets designed for this. They are low irritant and low allergy. An example is Hill\u2019s Sensitive Stomach but there are a number of these and your vet will have his\/her preference. You would need to use this for a week for any response and it\u2019s important to not feed anything else. I will also usually use a course of metronidazole which is an \u201cantibiotic\u201d effective against protozoan infections a common cause of colitis in cats. This medication also has an immunomodulatory effect and that can sometimes be involved. Other medications can also be used including cortisone and immunosuppressive drugs but I am reluctant to go to that extent without a full diagnostic process.\n\nWhereas I suspect IBD there are other possibilities but a diagnosis is needed before any treatment can be prescribed so that means the diagnostic process would have to be followed. But if your vet has not already considered IBD you should discuss this possibility with him\/her and ask about trying the diet and metronidazole option. The latter must be done in consultation with your vet of course.\n\nThis article (click here) will give you a good description of IBD. It\u2019s a veterinary information site with quality comment.\n\nI hope I\u2019ve been of help.

I clicked on the link above for the cat food and Hills was the name of the cat food that my second vet gave me BUT it wasn't the one you suggested. I bet thats exactly what she needs is that the one you showed me. Sorry for all the typos in my first question lol It was very late here. When I said I saw the large bowel i meant to say I \"say\" the large bowel. lol. I'm really thankful for this site because I was looking for a third opinion as my first vet didnt seem helpful at all. My second vet that I took her to seemed more helpful but i wanted a third opinion before I made any move for my little sweet kitty. I will do as you say and have them look in her rear and into her bowels. I think that is neccessary too. They did an Xray and saw nothing. But that makes sense because if her colon is probably inflammed an Xray wouldnt show that.\n\n\nI also wanted to tell you\/ask you...when her stomach starts hurting it makes her breath fast for a few seconds and I can also tell she gets an upset stomach because she licking her across her teeth back and forth like we do when we salivate. Also when she goes to stretch she makes a little crying noise. BUT yes like I was saying before after she passes gas or goes to the bathroom she's fine. Poor little thing. Thanks again for your help :)\n\nCustomer: replied\u00a03 years ago.\nThanks for checking in on my kitty it means a lot. I have since switched her food with my vet to the food you suggested and she is going to schedule her ultra sound. My vet thinks she may have pancreatitus. I'm hoping the ultrasound will reveal something. Thanks so much again.

        "text":"Does Hydrocortisone Help With Hair Loss?\n\nWhat happens if you use too much cortisone cream?\n\nYou\u2019re more likely to have a serious side effect if you use a strong hydrocortisone treatment (such as hydrocortisone butyrate) or if you use hydrocortisone on a large patch of skin for a long time.\n\nUsing hydrocortisone for many months at a time can make your skin thinner or cause stretchmarks..\n\nWhat is the best vitamin for hair loss?\n\nThe 5 Best Vitamins for Hair Loss Prevention, Based on ResearchBiotin. Biotin (vitamin B7) is important for cells inside your body. \u2026 Iron. Red blood cells need iron to carry oxygen. \u2026 Vitamin C. Vitamin C is essential for your gut to absorb iron. \u2026 Vitamin D. You might already know that vitamin D is important for bones. \u2026 Zinc.Nov 18, 2020\n\nIs steroid hair loss permanent?\n\nTaking steroids can further increase the production of DHT, which leads to hair loss. The good news is that if you stop taking steroids, your hair fall may stop eventually. But, in others, the hair loss may continue even after stopping the steroids.\n\nHow do you stop alopecia spreading?\n\nThe following may help you manage alopecia:Avoid hair and scalp trauma. Use a soft-bristled hair brush and wide-toothed comb to protect your scalp from damage. \u2026 Eat healthy foods. Hair loss can be caused by poor nutrition. \u2026 Reduce stress. Try to get enough sleep and daily exercise.\n\nDo steroid shots work for hair loss?\n\nSteroid injections have been used for alopecia areata since 1958. Studies from the 1970\u2019s showed that hair regrowth was found in 71% of people with Alopecia Areata, when treated every 2 weeks for 3 times. In another study, 63% of those receiving monthly steroid injections found regrowth at 4 months.\n\nWhat is the best treatment for female hair loss?\n\nHow is female hair loss treated? Minoxidil (Rogaine) 5% is the only topical medication approved by the FDA for female-pattern hair loss. The once daily use foam treatment regrows hair in 81% of the women who try it. Liquid options of 2% and 5% solutions are available over the counter.\n\nCan hair grow back after thinning?\n\nIf the reason for thinning hair is genetics, it will not grow back on its own. To grow back a healthy, full head of hair, you\u2019ll need to take action, and that involves reviewing different hair loss options.\n\nDoes hormonal hair loss grow back?\n\nThis type of hair loss happens when white blood cells attack hair follicles, causing the hair to thin and fall out, usually in round patches. This type of hair loss will require treatment as hair may not grow back.\n\nCan you put steroid cream on scalp?\n\nIn people with seborrheic dermatitis of the face or scalp, use of topical steroids for 4 weeks or less reduces symptoms more than placebo but has a similar effect to calcineurin inhibitors or azoles.\n\nIs hydrocortisone good for alopecia?\n\nIntralesional corticosteroids: Intralesional corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of alopecia areata. In fact, they are the first-line treatment in localized conditions involving <50% of the scalp22. Hydrocortisone acetate (25mg\/ml) and Triamcinolone acetonide (5-10mg\/ml) are commonly used.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between cortisone and hydrocortisone?\n\nHydrocortisone and cortisone are identical short-acting corticosteroids. However, they are not the same. Cortisone is an inactive prodrug that is converted into hydrocortisone, or cortisol, in the liver. Hydrocortisone works as a topical medication whereas cortisone is not as effective as a topical treatment.\n\nWhat steroid cream is used for alopecia?\n\nFluocinolone acetonide cream 0.2% (Synalar HP) twice daily or betamethasone dipropionate cream 0.05% (Diprosone) has been used. For refractory alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis, 2.5 g of clobetasol propionate under occlusion with a plastic film 6 days\/wk for 6 months helped a minority of patients.\n\nDoes hydrocortisone cream cause hair growth?\n\nStinging, burning, irritation, dryness, or redness at the application site may occur. Acne, unusual hair growth, \u201chair bumps\u201d (folliculitis), skin thinning\/discoloration, or stretch marks may also occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\nCan I use hydrocortisone on my scalp?\n\nWhen hydrocortisone cream can be used to treat seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, it doesn\u2019t actually treat dandruff. Dandruff is typically treated with medicated shampoos that contain either salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, or zinc pyrithione.\n\nDoes cortisone stop hair loss?\n\nCorticosteroid injections, like all treatments for alopecia areata, do not prevent new hair loss from developing. While there are few reported side effects related to this kind of treatment, temporary depressions (called \u201cdells\u201d) in the skin may result from the injections. However, these usually improve with time.\n\nWhat would a dermatologist prescribe for hair loss?\n\nIt can stop hairs from getting thinner and stimulate hair growth on the top of the scalp. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved minoxidil to treat hair loss. It is the only hair re-growth product approved for men and women. A dermatologist may combine minoxidil with another treatment.\n\nWhat kills fungus on the scalp?\n\nUse an antifungal shampoo These shampoos kill bacteria and fungus on the scalp and stop inflammation. You can purchase them from a grocery store or drugstore. Look for shampoos with antifungal active ingredients, such as ketoconazole, selenium sulfide, and pyrithione zinc.\n\nWhat is the best medicine for alopecia areata?\n\nPatchy alopecia areataMinoxidil: Also known by the brand name Rogaine\u00ae, minoxidil can help you keep the hair growth stimulated by another treatment. \u2026 Corticosteroids you apply: You apply this medication to the bald spots once or twice a day as instructed by your dermatologist.More items\u2026",

I started to develop pain in my upper hip area. During my runs I feel fine. It is after that I get a deep bruise like feeling in the very top I my TFL. If I sit for a while then get up the pain is very intense. The longer I sit the worse the pain is when I stand. I took time off 6 mths and then started to run and train again for another half. Again felt great on runs but pain after..especially after sitting. I am a yoga instructor as well and stretching it burns an causes more discomfort after. Standing side hinge hurts during and after. I have seen a pt who gave me hip abductor exercises. Side leg lifts. I have seen acupuncturist. I have had many many many massages -tried dry needling- energy work- you name it... It still hurts even after a one mile run. The one thing that seems to help is using a super high pressured water jet to hit the tfl directly after swimming but I only lasts a day. I just took a whole month off running and still no relief. Please please tell me that there is something I can do so I can enjoy running again??? I am a heel striker and I am working now at transitioning into a misfit striker. Help please!!!! Thanks in advance!!!!\n\nHi Jamie,\n\nI'm happy to say that I believe we'll be able to work together to solve this problem completely. \u00a0First I'll explain what is the most logical reason for this problem. There is a muscle called the psoas that originates along the front side of your lumbar vertebrae and then inserts into the top of your thigh bone, close to your pubic bone. \u00a0When the psoas contracts you bend forward. There is a second muscle, the iliacus, that originates along the inside curve of your pelvis, it then merges with the psoas, and combined they both insert into your inner thigh. \u00a0When the iliacus contracts you pick up your leg to take a step. \u00a0Between them any movement you make that brings your thigh closer to your trunk is being caused by one or both of these muscles. \u00a0It will help to make this more clear if you go to and read the entire thread, but meanwhile I'll give you the brief version. \u00a0\n\nYou have a third muscle, the rectus femoris, that originates on the tip of your pelvis and then goes down your thigh, over your kneecap, and inserts into the front of your shin bone. \u00a0These three muscles are responsible for rotating your pelvis forward and down (it will be more clear when you read the link I gave you), twisting\/contracting\/overstretching all of the muscles that have an impact on your pelvis, including your TFL. \u00a0If you go to you can enter in each of the muscle names and you'll see the muscle and also the action of the muscle.\n\nThe reason the high pressure water jet is helping is because you are releasing the tension in the TFL muscle fibers, but it comes back because it's not thoroughly released. Rather than doing abductor exercises, further shortening the TFL, I suggest you take a tennis ball, put it on your TFL and then lie down on the floor, lying on top of the tennis ball. \u00a0It's going to hurt so go slowly (inch into the ball rather than go straight on top of it). \u00a0I have been working with two amazing yoga teachers to help people first untie the spasms and then safely stretch with yoga. \u00a0If you go to you can read about it. As a yoga instructor I think you'll like what you will see, and you'll quickly be able to incorporate it into your yoga practice, helping you and your students.\n\nI believe you'll get a lot of immediate relief when you use the ball to flush out your TFL, please keep in touch and let me know how you are doing.\n\nWishing you well,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Julie Donnelly\n\nRepetitive Strain Injury\n\nAll Answers\n\nAnswers by Expert:\n\nAsk Experts\n\n\nJulie Donnelly, LMT\n\n\nI can accept questions that relate to chronic or acute pain caused by muscle spasms and contractions.

        "text":"Do you have any suggestions for protein-rich snacks that aren\u2019t\u00a0nuts?\n\nask our dietitian your question todayhigh protein snacks\n\n\nI\u2019d like to switch my diet to a healthier one, but am running into a problem. Many of the articles and suggested menus with recipes and snacks include NUTS in most of the breakfasts and almost all of the snack options for protein. I\u2019m allergic to nuts, so it\u2019s discouraging that it\u2019s so difficult to find options that I can actually eat. Do you have any suggestions for protein-rich snacks that aren\u2019t nuts? \u2013 Blair B.\n\n\n\nAbsolutely! Snack proteins can be the same as your entr\u00e9e choice, just smaller. You can always take your favorite meal and keep a half serving for a leftover snack. If reheated mini meals aren\u2019t for you, consider portable options that don\u2019t require a microwave. Plant options include soynuts, edamame, sunflower seeds, pepitas, bean salad and hummus. Animal-based snack options include hard-cooked eggs, jerky, yogurt, cottage cheese, string cheese and canned tuna.\n\n\nTo keep it simple choose a protein and combine it with a serving of fruit, starch or vegetable for a satisfying snack. Classics include: cheese + apple; hummus + carrots; and tuna + crackers. Or try combining more than one side in smaller amounts. Examples: 1) top Greek yogurt with berries and a nut-free granola that you\u2019ve added hemp or chia seeds to; 2) scoop up bean salsa and guacamole with baked pita chips; 3) for trail mix, combine soynuts and pepitas with dried cranberries, circle or square-shaped cereal and shredded coconut.\n\nYou can swap in soy \u2018nut\u2019 butter or sunflower seed butter in any recipe calling for almond or peanut butter. Either tastes great spread on a small wheat tortilla and wrapped around a banana. Try stuffing a handful of dates with some\u2026Hand wipes or napkin required.\n\n\u2013\u00a0Debbie J., MS, RD\n\nDo you have a question about your diet or nutrition?\n\nAsk our dietitian by submitting your question to or simply ask it in the COMMENTS section below.

Can you offer quick mental health tips for those stuck indoors?\u00a0\n\nDr. Gail Beck, Clinical Director of The Royal\u2019s Youth Program\n\nIf people are feeling cooped up and tired of being inside, it\u2019s important to remember that, as long as you keep a distance of two metres between yourself and other people, public health experts say it\u2019s OK to go outside for a walk or do yard work and play.\n\nIf you really cannot get outside and you find yourself becoming more and more anxious, connect online with friends if you have access to a device and WIFI; most wireless companies have become more forgiving of wireless usage so why not take advantage of this? With an account, you can also download a magazine from the library or a film or an audiobook. CBC has all of its programming available free for the time being; this will provide a lot of entertainment for you and your family.\n\nMusic and exercise are the two activities that most consistently help us manage anxiety or depression so you can get out your playlist, or build a new one. You can also find exercise websites online: for example\u00a0 which features yoga.\n\nAlso, remember that if mindfulness exercises help you relax, The Royal\u2019s Healthy Minds App has several good tools embedded in it to help you manage stress:\n\nFirst published in the Ottawa Citizen:\n\n\nAdd your questions to our COVID-19 Q&As",

To a very major degree.\n\nWhere I go into sheer panic, crying, wanting to die - the whole nine yards. What I do for immediate relief is take a pill, put in ear plugs, put in some loud music that says what I feel (at full volume) and if needed will drink something as well.\n\nBeen to therapists over the years - it never did anything for the trauma. Did EMDR - that got a lot of residue shit out but nothing was resolved in terms of the PTSD and loud noises.\n\nI've lived in war zones my entire life. From early childhood to middle age. On war fronts. Literally having rockets and missiles flying over, under and near me. I got freaked out and stayed that way.\n\nI need to get this resolved now once and for all. I can't continue living like a basket case. It's no way to live and I don't want to rely on chemicals to alter my perception either. For now, since I got no choice that's what I'm doing - but down the line - for sure - no.\n\nI can't start shelling out big bucks either. I have to keep this as much in-house as possible. I'm looking for EFT specifically geared for fear of noise, music that I can play LOUD, have a F you, I'm still alive and breathing message (Pearl Jam works very well for this) and anything I can use to HEAL MYSELF from this bloody affliction. Which it is - hands down.\n\nThanks for any help.\nposted by watercarrier to Health & Fitness (7 answers total) 6 users marked this as a favorite\nThis is a different sort of approach, but maybe it could be useful: there is a type of electronic earplug that hunters sometimes use to protect their ears while shooting. It lets in ordinary sounds, but blocks sudden, loud percussions over a preset decibel limit. Here's an example (that's a clunky behind-the-ear model; for more $$$ you can get the barely visible in-the-ear type). Knowing that all sudden loud noises would be edited out of your perception while wearing something like this might give you some well-deserved peace.\nposted by Corvid at 9:39 AM on January 12, 2013 [1 favorite]\n\nIt's more than I can afford right now...but thanks corvid\nposted by watercarrier at 10:28 AM on January 12, 2013\n\nNot specific to noise, but I've recently seen research that people with PTSD who practice mindfulness meditation have less of a startle reaction to noise after a month or so of practice. Anything by John Kabat Zinn is a great start to a practice and there are lots of free meditation audio tracks online for free. I'd be happy to point you in the direction of some sites if you'd like to memail me.\n\nAs a therapist who specializes in empirically supported treatments for PTSD, I can't help but plug either Prolonged Exposure or Cognitive Processing Therapy. Research shows about a 90% success rate for treatment completers. PE is similar to EMDR when it comes to the imaginal part, but the in vivo component might help a lot when it comes to the loud noises. CPT is quite a bit different, but is also effective in reducing symptoms of hypervigilance. You may be able to find some sliding-scale treatment providers who are trained in either method in your area.\nposted by gilsonal at 11:27 AM on January 12, 2013 [1 favorite]\n\nCan you keep a physical object with you to remind you that you're safe? I have a necklace that I wear for this reason. While I still get triggered, the panic lasts for much less time because I can touch the necklace and feel the proof that I'm not in danger. Even putting it on in the morning helps: it's a nice little ritual to start the day, reminding myself that I got out of the unsafe situation and nobody is going to hurt me.\nposted by a hat out of hell at 11:40 AM on January 12, 2013 [1 favorite]\n\nI asked this question a while back.

I still startle, and sometimes panic, but I can damp it down a lot more than I used to. Some is getting older and better, some is being able to react mindfully to the panic response which I've never been able to do previously.\n\nWhen I need noise I quite like The White Stripes (Seven Nation Army in particular), Nine Inch Nails (HyperPower and the Saul Williams remix, Survivalism, The Art of Self-Destruction), Tool (Hooker With A Penis, Vicarious, Ticks and Leeches, Schism) and How To Destroy Angels (Parasite, Ice Age) and Marilyn Manson (Seizure of Power). Oh and pretty much anything by Rage Against the Machine. Just as a reminder the song Vicarious, and the entire Year Zero album, have some war themes\/imagery that might be unhelpful. Check out Love Outside Andromeda and Curve as well, for some other nice wall'o'sound therapeutic deafening of the noise inside your head.\nposted by geek anachronism at 4:16 PM on January 12, 2013 [1 favorite]\n\nThere's a much less expensive mechanical variant of the \"stop the sudden loud noises\" earplugs, FWIW.

        "text":"How does a vegan diet replace amino acids from meat, dairy, and eggs?\n\nExpert Answers\nbelarafon eNotes educator| Certified Educator\n\nA vegan diet prohibits all animal products, even eggs and milk, which many vegetarian diets allow as they are normal parts of animal and bird life. Because of this, a strict vegan diet may lack some parts of nutrition that are most efficiently consumed through meat or eggs; essential amino acids, which are protein, are most available through meat and less so through vegetables and fruits. Amino acids are essential for healing, growth, and general good health.\n\nTo provide a properly balanced amino acid intake, the vegan diet should contain at least 1.4 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight; women should consume about ten grams less total than men. A healthy man weighing 68kg should consume at least 55 grams of protein daily. This protein can be found in many vegetables, but in lesser quantities than in eggs or meat; while meat and eggs are complete proteins, meaning that they contain all the essential amino acids, most vegetables contain incomplete proteins. However, by eating a wide variety of plants including nuts, fruits, beans, and vegetables, the body will store and regulate proper amino acid levels. One of the only plants that has a complete amino acid profile is the soybean; soybean-based foods are very healthy, as they contain protein and fiber in high quantities compared to other plants, as well as good fats.\n\nEssentially, a varied diet with daily servings of soybean products should provide all the amino acids necessary for a healthy diet. Contrary to popular belief, there is little chance of protein starvation on vegan diets unless the diet is restricted to only a few types of food.\n\neli468 | Student\n\nA (healthy) vegan diet provides the proper amount of amino acids needed for the body through complete proteins. As the person above stated, soy beans are one of the foods that provides a complete protein. This is why many \"Fake Meat\" products are made with soy and why tofu is associated most with vegans\/vegetarians (tofu is made from soybeans).\u00a0\n\nThere are vegans that are allergic to soy and still get all the essential amino acids needed through, once again, complete proteins. These are through combinations of food to create complimentary proteins. They do not have to be eaten together, just as long as these foods are eaten within the same day. Some complimentary protein combinations include:\n\n  \u2022 Black beans and rice\n  \u2022 Pasta and peas\n  \u2022 Whole wheat bread and peanut butter\n  \u2022 Bean soup and crackers\n  \u2022 Roasted nuts, seeds and peanuts\n  \u2022 Hummus (chickpeas and tahini)\n  \u2022 Lentils and almonds\n\nAs long as there are enough complete or complimentary proteins eaten throughout the day, a vegan can get all the amino acids needed.\n\nAccess hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.\n\nStart Free Trial\nAsk a Question",
