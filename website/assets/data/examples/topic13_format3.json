Articles on all aspects of the history of the Wild West are welcome. All submissions should be sent in the first instance to Mike Cox, editor of the JOURNAL. They will then be reviewed and assessed by the appropriate member(s) of the WWHA editorial board and\/or a specialist(s) in the particular aspect of Wild West history involved within the article.\n\n\n\nMike Cox\n\n83 Ridgewood Cir.\n\nWimberley, TX 78676\n\n\n\nEditorial Board, WHHA:\n\nJohn Boessenecker\n\nDan Buck\n\nRobert DeArment\n\nFrederick Nolan (Chair)\n\nWilliam B. Secrest\n\n\nLetters of inquiry are welcome; advice and assistance always available. If you are writing or have completed an article on any aspect of western history and wish to submit it to WWHA for consideration, please read the guidelines which follow.\n\n\nGetting It Right\n\n\nHave you done some original research on frontier history that begs for a wider audience?\u00a0 Have you discovered facts, photographs, fresh insights into the lives and times of such famous figures as Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, Butch and Sundance or Wild Bill, or alternatively, unpublished details about some little-known but significant event in the colorful pageant of the American West? If so, the Wild West History Association wants to publish your findings.\n\n\nBefore you start writing, however, there are a few things you need to know.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, you must write clearly. Tell your story simply and without adornment. Keep your sentences relatively short and to the point, avoid using words whose meaning you are unsure of, and, unless you are quoting someone\u2019s actual words, avoid slang or profanity.\n\n\nCritical or personal attacks of a hostile nature on another article or person will not be countenanced.\u00a0 Submissions must always be based on documented fact.\u00a0 Conjecture or supposition must be clearly stated as such.\u00a0 Always remember, when considering what to write and how to write it, that you are addressing a sophisticated readership who may already know a great deal about the subject you are addressing. You will need to convince them of the originality and comprehensiveness of your research and the validity of your conclusions by citing your sources either in the body text or in the form of footnotes.\n\n\nTo ensure that your work is presented properly and readably, WWHA\u2019s editorial board is and will be there to assist you, to help make your contribution as accurate, as literate and as accessible as possible. If you are contemplating writing an article or have a work in progress, but are uncertain of how to proceed or whether it would be suitable for publication, the editor will be happy to advise you or to refer your question to an appropriate member of the board. Our aim is and will be always to enhance and clarify your work; indeed, like no other publication of its kind, the WWHA JOURNAL guarantees you will always be given a final opportunity to review the edited piece before it goes to press.\n\n\n\nFor instructions on how to prepare and to submit your manuscript, please contact the editor.\n\n\u00a9 Wild West History Association - a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation",

        "text":"Additions and Corrections\n\nLet me start out by saying that I know that there must be mistakes in the information that I have gathered here on this site. Errors can creep in at so many places including the person initially supplying vital information, or the officials who recorded it. It could be copied or transcribed from the original improperly; it could be erroneously used in an article or book, or the typesetter could have made an error. Of course, I could be the culprit and have made a mistake in taking my notes or publishing the information here on this website.\n\nThe entire business from beginning to end is fraught with human error. I have found errors in several recorded vital records. My grandfather, John Downs, has his name misspelled on his official birth record. They have \u201cDowns\u201d spelled with an \u201ce\u201d rendering it \u201cDownes.\u201d\n\nI have done everything in my power to keep the errors out. I am meticulous in the way I gather information, searching out the most original sources I can find, and I question everything that passes through my hands. It always amazes me how people can continuously copy information over and over again that just can\u2019t be true. I have seen cases of a woman getting married at age 10 and having her first baby at age 12. Others have copied this information over and over again. No one along the way looked at the dates to see if it all made sense.\n\nIf you find what you believe to be an error, or an omission, on any of these pages, please bring it to my attention. I won\u2019t be offended if you do. I do ask that you first check the Myths and Misconceptions page. Many sources are being published today that still publish mistakes made over a century ago. Also, note that I have not included many items that are accepted in some circles because I feel the proof is not strong enough yet.\n\nIf you find an error, email me at the address at the bottom of this page. I may check my notes and sources, and see it was an error on my part. I may also ask for your sources so I can adequately document everything, since I may be correcting a mistake in an otherwise reliable source. I may even list you as the source if this is appropriate.\n\nThere is plenty here that I have merely compiled and not worked on directly. However, anything that I personally research, try to solve or delve into deeply, I report using a high standard of proof.\u00a0 You can visit the Standards page of their site here. This doesn\u2019t mean that I won\u2019t publish conjecture, but when I do, it will be clearly labeled as such. I often write about theories, so others have some information to start with if they wish to look deeper into a given subject. But I always state plainly my uncertainty of the facts.\n\nIf you come across any broken links, please email us at",

This page will take you on the journey of a record from donation to exhibition through appraisal, cataloguing and digitisation to its final destinations for preservation and access.\n\nPlan of Bishopsteignton Heritage Hub\n\n\nThe Bishopsteignton Heritage Hub\n\nOpening times\n\nThe Hub is currently closed to the public. We hope to re-open for visitors and researchers by the end of the year. If you have an urgent enquiry or research need, please email the team at [email\u00a0protected]\n\n\nOur Hub is split into 5 zones which facilitate different parts of the work of Bishopsteignton Heritage by providing space, equipment and expertise to anyone visiting or volunteering.\n\n  \u2022 Welcome Desk: a workstation from which the Hub supervisor can perform Appraisal, Accessioning and Cataloguing as well as make sure all Hub users are comfortable and happy.\n  \u2022 Community Access workstations: where visitors, volunteers and other stakeholders can access the collection and gather for research, training, meetings and discussions to explore the story of Bishopsteignton.\n  \u2022 Archive Store: this area provides a good standard of preservation for the collection and makes valuable archive material accessible into the future.\n  \u2022 Digitisation Station: this area houses our specialist digitisation equipment and a computer work-station where post-digitisation processing takes place, making our collections accessible online to the whole world!\n  \u2022 Flexible exhibition area: can be used for temporary exhibitions or filled with extra seating or work stations for additional visitor capacity.\n\nArchival Processes\n\nAll the Guides on how to carry out Archival Processes in the Hub are available here! No one guide should be used in isolation, the best way to take archive material on its processing journey is to use each guide \u00a0for the right job alongside an understanding of our Policies.\n\nAppraisal & Accessioning Guide\n\nThis Guide details the way in which we appraise and accession material that is brought into the BH Hub for donation or loan. Guidance includes how to treat both physical and digital records as well as what to do if material does not adhere to the BH Collections Development Policy (CDP) including de-accessioning and disposal. This guide does not detail Digitisation, Cataloguing or any steps beyond the appraisal and accessioning of archive material into the care or ownership of BH.\n\nCataloguing Guide\n\nThis guide describes the importance of the cataloguing process as a vital step in our Digitisation project which aims to make as much archive material accessible online as possible. It contains the detailed guidance on how best to fill in the Item Input Form including tips on making sure we record all the information we need and conventions for standardising the way we communicate that information. This all goes towards making the Archive Collection search tool as user-friendly as possible!\n\nWhile Cataloguing, it is also useful to refer to the Transcription Guide. It explains\u00a0conventions which must be used to ensure that a transcription is as useful as possible in digital form while remaining true and accurate to the original manuscript.\n\nDigitisation Guide\n\nThis Guide provides detailed instructions on how to create good quality digital surrogates for archive material using the equipment available in the Heritage Hub. Equipment includes a Brother MFC-J6930DW Printer\/Scanner and a Canon 6D Camera and rig. This guide does not include detailed set-up instructions for using the equipment. The equipment requires software to capture images. This guide does not include detailed instructions on how to install or set up the supporting software. If you require any guidance beyond the information in this document, please speak to a member of the Heritage Hub team.\n\nMedia Library Upload Guide\n\nThis guide sets out instructions for uploading digitised\/digital archive material as images or PDFs to the BH website\u2019s Media Library. By uploading our digital collections to the website, we can make them accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world!\n\nCollections Policies\n\nCollections Development Policy\n\nThe\u00a0overarching policy that governs all of Bishopsteignton Heritage\u2019s general collecting practices and affects all archival and museum collecting, preservation, and access practices.\n\nPreservation Policy\u00a0(DRAFT)\n\nThis policy aims to\u00a0ensure that the record held by BH is preserved to facilitate access for as long as possible.\n\nAccess Policy\u00a0(DRAFT)\n\nThis policy aims to\u00a0ensure that the record held by BH is accessible to as many people as possible for as long as possible.",
