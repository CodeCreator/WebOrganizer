        "text":"Encasements Press Release\n\n\nJanuary 23\u2014March 5, 2016\n\nDavid Zwirner is pleased to present\u00a0Doug Wheeler: Encasements, the artist's third solo exhibition with the gallery, on view at 537 West 20th Street in New York. This exhibition represents the most comprehensive presentation to date of this important body of work, and will comprise\u00a0five \"encasements,\"\u00a0including a rarely seen \"center light\"\u00a0work. Presented here in an open configuration, viewers will have the unprecedented opportunity to consider these singular works in relation to one another and to compare the distinct luminous atmospheric effects and subtle tonal variations that characterize each of them. Previously, no more than two encasements have been shown together, as in exhibitions at Fort Worth Art Center Museum, Texas (1969), Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (1969), and Tate Gallery, London (1970), and accordingly this exhibition aims to underscore their ongoing\u00a0significance.\n\nA pioneering figure in what is often referred to as the Light and Space movement in Los Angeles during the 1960s and 1970s, Wheeler is noted for his innovative constructions and installations that manipulate the perception and experience of space, volume, and light. First conceived\u00a0between 1967 and 1969, the artist's \"light encasements\"\u00a0evolved out of his longstanding\u00a0experimentations with fabricated acrylic and neon, and consist of large panels of vacuum-formed plastic with neon lighting embedded along their inside edges. Installed in a white room with all architectural detail and ambient light eliminated, the light paintings appear to dematerialize, immersing viewers in a luminous space where light seems to have almost particulate mass.\n\nWheeler created only twenty encasements of this type in addition to two variant center light encasements, one of which can be found in the collection of the Orange County Museum of Art, Newport Beach, California, and the other of which will be shown\u00a0publicly for the first time in this exhibition. In the latter works, the neon light emanates from the center of the panel, rather than its edges, creating a more condensed luminosity. Unbounded by any kind of frame, the light appears to dematerialize from its source and hover within the space, thus generating a distinctive physiological experience. By shifting the work's construction in this way, Wheeler provides an effective counterpoint to his own practice and deepens our perceptual experience.\n\nWhen they were first realized, these works marked a significant transitional moment in the artist's practice, completing his move from creating discrete objects to conceptualizing the immersive environments for which he has become known. As in his overall body of work, Wheeler's encasements challenge the idea of the work of art as a tangible aesthetic object by providing the viewer with a total sensorial experience. Of Wheeler's\u00a0works, John Coplans, curator of the artist\u2019s\u00a01968 solo exhibition at the Pasadena Art Museum, noted, \"they clearly reveal a highly mature esthetic and demonstrate that he is a satellite of no other artist\u2026[Wheeler's] primary aim as [an artist] is to reshape or change the spectator's perception of the seen world. In short, [his] medium is not light or new materials or technology, but\u00a0perception.\u201d\u00b9\n\n\u00b9John Coplans,\u00a0Doug Wheeler. Exh. bro.

This suite of case studies, developed and written by Gensler design and delivery experts, supplements the curricula used at accredited architecture and design schools by exposing readers to authentic project scenarios and teaching them how to apply principles learned in the classroom to actual project work. Already in use at several top design schools, the series has elicited positive responses from students and professors alike.\n\n\u201cThe Gensler Case Study series provides real-world professional scenarios for group and individual discussion,\u201d says Jennifer Chandela, professor of Professional Practice at Tulane School of Architecture. \u201cIn my Professional Practice course it infuses the lecture class format with opportunities for seminar-style discussion.\u201d\n\nThe Professional Practice Case Study Series features topics covered in the American Institute of Architect\u2019s Handbook of Professional Practice. Volume 2 examines multipurpose base building and corporate interiors projects. Each entry in the series provides background information on budgets, funding, and contractual agreements in order to convey a broad understanding of the overall project. Users are then guided through 10 different scenarios, each covering a different challenge, opportunity, or project specific function. Video interviews with Gensler practitioners supplement the written material and provide personal insights into the design process.\n\nTo download a sample and purchase Gensler Case Studies, visit:\n\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Gensler\nContact Person: Kevin Craft\nEmail: [email\u00a0protected]\nPhone: 202.776.7585\nCountry: United States",

        "text":"Web Analytics Made Easy -\nPhoto Contest Insider Blog\n\nWinners of the Scottish Ballet Alice Photography Competition\n\nMarch 15, 2011\n\nWe can now reveal the winners of our Alice Photography Competition!\n\nOverall winner\/Digital Art category winner\n\nAmy Fokinther \u2013 Imagination\n\n\u201cThe inspiration for this image came from the word \u2018imagination\u2019: I have included two prominent characters in the story, The Hatter and the March Hare, and incorporated them within Alice\u2019s face to emphasise that they are all characters in her imagination.\u201d\n\nPhotography category winner\n\nTimea Porubszky \u2013 Alice\n\u201cAlice found herself in wonderland, but this magical world exists only on her own imagination, which is why I used an old style mirror where she can look at herself with curious interest. I would like to show her as a strong, confident character rather than an innocent little girl.\u201d\n\nFacebook favourite (poll taken from 07 March \u2013 13 March, received 280 votes)\n\nLaura McKinnon \u2013 Warp\n\n\u201cWhen I discovered that Scottish Ballet were running an Alice-themed photography competition, I immediately knew that my photograph would need to have sinister undertones. Having read Alice in Wonderland and its sequel Through the Looking Glass as a child, I distinctly remembered being disturbed by the surreal and disorientating content of the book. My own personal interpretation of the book itself reflected very much a dreamlike, erratic narration, of which led to a degree of panicking my younger self \u2013 the sheer random content of the book was unsettling and thought provoking as a child and ultimately influenced my interest in surrealism as I grew older. I suppose, the older I aged, the less enamoured I became with the simplicity and pleasantness of popular fairy tales and I found myself seeking the originality that Carroll had offered up to me.\u201d\n\nDigital Art category finalist\n\nAnnette Rubery \u2013 You\u2019re Nothing But a Pack of Cards!\n\n\u201cThis image didn\u2019t start out as an Alice in Wonderland-themed composition. Having long been interested in surreal self-portraiture, I set myself the challenge of picturing myself \u2018levitating\u2019 (an effect achieved by blending multiple images in Photoshop and masking out the object I\u2019m lying on). I knew I wanted flying playing cards somewhere, too, but it wasn\u2019t until I got to the processing stage that the rest fell into place. Something about my position reminded me of Alice falling down the rabbit hole; the pose might look easy but the effort of keeping my limbs elevated was better than a workout!\u201d\n\nDigital Art category finalist\n\nClaire Davidson \u2013 Alice\n\n\u201cI am inspired by the idea of Alice falling through the lens of a camera: how the beginnings of photography brought questions about our perception of reality and how Lewis Carol\u2019s stories reflect this. The increasing use of digital manipulation of images brings new questions about our perceived visual reality and I wanted to explore this in my image. My drawings are inspired in part by Victorian naturalist\u2019s illustrations that I imagine Alice would have been familiar with, but with a playful twist- a sense of the creatures forming and morphing in her imagination in a fluid, tumbling, dream-like space.\u201d\n\nPhotography category finalist\n\nAgnes Kliczka \u2013 Alice\n\n\u201cAs a student of Stevenson College Edinburgh I received good education in constructing image which I used trying to fill the brief. My attempt was to visualise an idea of celebration in dream like place. Alice, who is an explorer (I use symbol of binoculars which lay on the ground) is accompanied by two surreal characters (they symbolise opposite forces). I constructed image in which I tried to avoid clich\u00e9s. My picture is full of details which I have set up carefully, and the most unexpected for viewer is a dog in front door. Camera angle gives unusual perspective. My inspiration comes from fashion photography and allegorical oil paintings.\u201d\n\nPhotography category finalist\n\nAnia Mroczkowska \u2013 My Alice\n\n\u201cMy picture of Alice had been obviously inspired by the magical story by Lewis Carroll especially the part when she enters the world of Queen of Hearts. I used playing cards as a main prop; after many shots where cards weren\u2019t in a right place (my assistant was throwing them) I captured this one where cards created kind of circle \u2013 at that moment I knew I have my Alice shot. I wanted this picture to be simple and eye catchy; I hope that I achieved that and after looking at my photograph no one will have a doubt that it is Alice, my Alice\u2026\u201d\n\nPhotography category finalist\n\nJon Davey \u2013 Stories Come to Life\n\n\u201cFor my competition entry I returned to the originals \u2013 Lewis Carroll\u2019s words and John Tenniel\u2019s illustrations. All subsequent interpretations of the story stem from the books Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There first published in the mid nineteenth century and therefore my photograph returned to the source and the magical inspiration the words and pictures have provided for generations over almost 150 years. A selection of characters, with Alice herself in the foreground, are seen springing out of the pages of the book. Alice is lit as if in a theatre spotlight and the open book itself resembles a stage, upon which the story unfolds, while in the background a simple teapot becomes a starlit backdrop. Overall the image has an almost timeless connection to the magic of Lewis Carroll\u2019s stories and the world of the imagination.\u201d\n\nDigital Art finalist\n\nKerry Calder \u2013 Curiouser and Curiouser\n\n\u201cI have always been interested in the story of Alice in Wonderland and the most poignant character for me is the Rabbit, he is the one who attracts Alice\u2019s curiosity and leads her into Wonderland. He is symbolic of innocence and the urgency of time, he is a constant reminder to Alice that she must return home and continue to grow up. The clock represents the fears and struggles of adulthood and that it is inevitable, Alice cannot run away from it. I chose to shoot the image of the Rabbit in a new age and dreamlike approach, incorporating oversized clocks to stress the importance that time has within the story. I also chose to use a female model suggesting that the rabbit could have been an alter-ego of Alice within her dreams. The mask helps to create visuals in a candid manner, confirming the subject matter to the viewer.\u201d\n\nOffice favourite!\n\nSophie and Annie Barber \u2013 Barbie does Alice!\n\n\u201cWe hope you like our photo! We have made the backgrounds, and used Barbie and Bratz dolls as the dancers.\u00a0We are always putting on Barbie Ballet Productions so this is a fantastic opportunity!\u201d\n\nThe winning entries will feature in:\n\n\u2013 The Alice programme\n\n\u2013 A private exhibition for friends and sponsors of Scottish Ballet\n\n\u2013 A virtual exhibition on Scottish Ballet\u2019s website\n\nThe overall winner will also receive two tickets to an Alice performance of their choice and a copy of\u00a0our book Scottish Ballet: Forty Years, and their image will feature in\u00a0the Scottish Ballet Alice exhibition, to be displayed in the National Library of Scotland\u00a0in Edinburgh.\n\nView the winners here\n\nComments are closed.",

Projects should be available for touring in 2015 and 2016 (at Without Walls member festivals and associate festivals, as well as to other events) and should be suitable both for civic\/urban spaces and park sites \/ rural locations. Without Walls has already identified one large-scale project to support in 2015, making it 'very unlikely' they will support another large-scale show.\n\n    Without Walls has commissioning funds to support the creation of work, but normally funds 20-60% of the total cost of a project. As Without Walls is funded through Grants for the Arts, projects that have already received G4A support are not eligible for commissioning funds but can still apply for touring support.\n\n    For more information and to apply see here. Deadline for submissions is 2 October 2014 at 5pm. Shortlisted projects will be notified the week of 27 October 2014. Supported projects will be informed the week of 8 December 2014, and the presentation of supported work begins May 2015.",

        "text":"a-n has been offering travel bursaries for members since 2013. Originally known as \u2018Go and See\u2019 bursaries, they quickly built up traction with artists and artist-groups applying for funds to further research and identify new connections.\n\na-n now offer Artist Bursaries for members to pursue self-led professional development. Along with skills development and mentoring, this also includes the opportunity to fund travel \u2014 to network with other artists, seek collaborations, and to visit countries or cities pertinent to new or ongoing ideas.\n\nIn 2017, 24 members received Travel bursaries and all of these have contributed to a-n\u2019s\u00a0Blogs. Here we highlight\u00a0six of these, to draw out varied content focusing on topics such as identity, migration, community and nationalism.\n\nSogol Mabadi\n\nGlasgow-based artist Sogol Mabadi makes performance-orientated work. Her practice often delves into her Iranian migrant identity and the connections she makes now with familial and cultural histories.\n\nWith her Travel bursary she spent time in Tehran, visiting her grandmother and producing photographs during a month of walking the streets of the city in silence.\n\nAlong with a new body of \u201chazy\u201d photographic works taken without a viewfinder from behind her headscarf, Mabadi\u2019s research also helped her think of new departures away from her being \u201cdependent on personal material and history\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wonder if following this trip I will be able to bring some reality to the fantasy that follows in the trail of longing and nostalgia, which becomes part of many migrants\u2019 DNA. I wonder if as a result I can help shift my own work to become less dependent on personal material and history, even if it gathers valuable information from it.\u201d\n\nDanny Treacy\n\n\u201cIn 2016, on a self-funded research trip to Guadalajara [capital of the Mexican state of Jalisco] I discovered a significant amount of clothing that was related to a current socio-political issue of transit migration via train routes.\u201d\n\nLondon-based artist and educator Danny Treacy used his bursary for revisiting Mexico, to pursue an ongoing body of work. This involved working with groups of participants on \u201csite-specific workshops\u201d to find and document clothing discarded along train tracks in the Jalisco region.\n\nTreacy\u2019s research was spurred by its similarities with his existing Them series; hooded patchwork clothing made for photographic subjects revealing the individual as part of \u201ca mass, unknown and undefined\u201d group.\n\nThe 2017 bursary period allowed the artist to dig deeper into social anthropological and socio-economic issues connected to migrants, and their restricted yet constant movement as marginalised communities.\n\nSanna Charles\n\n\u201cThese connections and collaborations have begun to form an important part of how I can function as an artist and it is thanks to funding and networks like a-n that make projects such as mine possible.\u201d\n\nSanna Charles used her Travel bursary to visit a number of rural dancers and dance halls in Finland, researching the tradition and its close ties to community. People she met were generous in posing for photographic portraits, which can be seen on her blog Couple Dancing in Rural Finland.\n\nWritten as an \u201cunravelling of the people and places\u201d the London-based artist encountered, the blog is a commentary on etiquette practiced by the dancers and a diary of locations visited (Mikkeli, Hartola, Ristina, M\u00e4ntyharju). It is also the beginnings of a collection of interviews and collaborations.\n\n\u201cI have stayed in touch with many of the people I spoke to and photographed, firstly to send them their portrait and secondly as I carry on waiting to see where this project is going next, to interview people further.\u201d\n\nSarah Marsh\n\nAfter working on Open Doors, a series of autism-friendly workshops for children and parents at Manchester Art Gallery from 2014 to 2017, Sarah Marsh was invited by \u0141aznia CSW in Gdansk, Poland, to produce a six-week strand of workshops. The result is Space in the Process.\n\n\u201cAn important element of the project was the engagement of the local community, we wanted to observe first-hand how families with children with autism and other social communication challenges connected with the gallery\u2019s interior and exterior spaces.\u201d\n\nHer bursary allowed her to work in-depth over this period \u2014 making objects for participants to touch, move, smell and wear, exploring the benefits of a multi-sensory experience for children with autism.\n\nShe comments on the bursary experience:\u00a0\u201cThis has been an important turning point for my practice, I found all elements of the process well supported through the a-n team.\n\n\u201cThe bursary allowed me to revisit ideas in a new environment and forced me to reflect on my artistic practice. The blog has opened up new writing opportunities, I\u2019ve built up a network of creative people with different life and work experiences.\u201d\n\nMalik Nashad Sharpe\n\nOne of Malik Nashad Sharpe\u2019s posts on his blog N A T I O N A L I S M repeats these two questions: \u201cWhy did I have to see that image with that man in blackface hanging in two separate places in my rehearsal space? Why do racist histories get maintained?\u201d\n\nPresented as a form of mantra, his words embody movement; a key force in the New York\/London-based artist\u2019s work as a choreographer and dance artist.\n\nHe dived straight in with documenting his bursary period, using the blog as a space to reinforce a passionate commitment to his chosen medium, posting GIFs and multiple images alongside blocks of unformatted texts.\n\nSharpe used his bursary to visit Toronto and Montreal in Canada and Vermont in the U.S.A, in order to continue working in duet with Montreal-based choreographer Ellen Furey.

No distractions. No on-going responsibilities.

This took the risk out of the print process [\u2026] Marja is an expert lithographer.

The tour will be followed by a prsentation by professor and author\u00a0William Moore, entitled \u2018Solomon\u2019s Temple in America: Masonic Architecture, Popular Culture, and Biblical Imagery 1865-1930.\u2019\n\nFreemasonry was ubiquitous in the United States between 1865 and 1930. Because of the centrality of Solomon\u2019s temple to the Masonic ritual, members represented it repeatedly in paintings, decorative arts, and architecture. Through analysis of works ranging from lithographs to mausoleums and from circus performances to church windows this lecture examines how Masonic conceptions of the temple permeated the nation during this period.\n\nDon\u2019t miss your chance to see and hear about the detailed craftsmanship in this Kansas City landmark. Limited tour tickets available.\n\nWilliam Moore is an Associate Professor of American Material Culture at Boston University where he also serves as Director of the American & New England Studies Program and teaches in the Department of History of Art and Architecture. He holds degrees from Harvard College and Boston University and is currently first vice president of the Vernacular Architecture Forum, the premier national scholarly organization for the study of ordinary buildings and landscapes. He is the author of Masonic Temples: Freemasonry, Ritual Architecture and Masculine Archetypes.

San Francisco would like to announce our third workshop from the Alternative Exposures Grant called\u00a0Physical Traces, with New York-based artist\u00a0Ricardo Miranda Z\u00fa\u00f1iga on hand-drawn rotoscoping techniques. We are partnering with\u00a0Artists\u2019 Television Access (ATA), which has been supporting community experimental media in the Mission District for over 25 years to produce this event.\nYou can register here, only $65:\nWorkshop Description\nRicardo will teach step-by-step methods for creating rotoscope animations. Participants will use live-action video to generate a series of stills that will be used as templates to trace a drawn version of each video still and then export the drawn stills as a video file. The finished projects will be displayed on the web and exhibited in the storefront windows of ATA.\nParticipants will brainstorm 3 to 5 second body gestures that will be recorded on video. The theme to keep in mind for the movement is human gesture in the public space. \u00a0Questions to consider may be how do we convey meaning and emotion in a public space through the use of our bodies. \u00a0How can a brief physical action or gesture convey a specific meaning in a public situation and stir reflection by others? Are there gestures that you have witnessed by a stranger that caused a reaction or remained as a memory? \u00a0How may a gesture be tied to a specific location?\nThis will be a 2-day workshop from\u00a011-4pm on Saturday, June 1st\u00a0and\u00a011-4pm on Sunday, June 2nd.\nArtists\u2019 Television Access\n992 Valencia Street, San Francisco\nSupport for this workshop is provided by Southern Exposure\u2019s Alternative Exposure Grant Program.\nUpgrade Event with Artist\u2019s Talk on\u00a0May 30th\nThe workshop will be preceded by an artist\u2019s talk by\u00a0Ricardo Miranda Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u00a0on\u00a0Thursday May 30th\u00a0also at ATA, from\u00a07-9pm. He will discuss both the workshop and his practice, more generally.\nSpace is limited, so sign up early for the workshop. It\u2019s only $65!\nAbout the artist\nRicardo Miranda Z\u00fa\u00f1iga approaches art as a social practice that seeks to establish dialogue in public spaces. Having been born of immigrant parents and grown up between Nicaragua and San Francisco, a strong awareness of inequality and discrimination was established at an early age. Themes such as immigration, discrimination, gentrification and the effects of globalization extend from highly subjective experiences and observations into works that tactically engage others through populist metaphors while maintaining critical perspectives. \u00a0Ricardo has established a socially investigative creative practice that utilizes whatever media possible to present content in a manner that may generate interaction and discussion by others.\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"ArtsOhio Blog\n\nThe ArtsOhio Blog is the Ohio Arts Council's way to share stories that highlight the arts in Ohio, feedback from the field, interviews with artists and staff, and more. Sign up for the ArtsOhio newsletter to receive a curated selection of posts each month.\n\nToledo Museum of Art logo\n\nGuest Post: Spring Forward with the Ohio Arts Council\n\nRecently I was taking a moment to reflect on a wonderful series of events and opportunities the Ohio Arts Council made available this spring; which began for me with the Sustainability category panel review in April 2015 and culminated in having the opportunity to hear the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts speak at the Cleveland Museum of Art. I am relatively new to the arts profession and even more so to grant writing (with three years experience). So needless to say I have been seeking any and every opportunity to learn from others how to refine my narratives, overall tone, and presentation of information\u2014along with meeting some amazing, inspiring people along the way.\u00a0\n\nEveryone has experienced at some point that dreaded feeling of walking into a room, not entirely sure if you are in the right location, and trying to find an empty spot in the back! When I went to the panel review, there were only empty spots. As the panel review day went on and I was scribbling frantically to capture every ounce of feedback the panel reviewers were providing on each organization\u2019s application (40 in total), I was astonished how few individuals took advantage of the professional development opportunity the OAC provided; and I should mention, free of cost. And, yes, for me too the review was professional development.\n\nAs I noticed sitting in the chairs for over eight hours listening to these experts in their own fields discuss each application, they went into depth on the prose that was used, the compilation of materials, use and ease of supplemental materials, financial data captured in the Cultural Data Project, and community engagement. And I also experienced the physical dialogue that transpired between panelists, which I fear would have been lost by only tuning into the live streaming event on the internet.\u00a0\n\nBy attending the whole day event, and not just tuning into my application, this process allowed me to see trends in the comments, suggestions, and overall approach that in effect will improve my ability to capture a reader\u2019s attention in the future.\u00a0\n\nThen fast forwarding to May, the Cleveland Museum of Art hosted the Ohio Arts Council and Chairman Jane Chu of the NEA in a conversation about the arts. It\u2019s unique and inspiring to see how each one of us, whatever our personal reason for supporting the arts, has a common ground for understanding how important art is for humanity. It has the potential to convey and evoke an emotion, meaning, idea, and create a moment of sheer wonder.\n\nHaving the opportunity to hear Chairman Chu speak and share her own life\u2019s experience with art. As she said: it is about understanding the impact the arts have on our lives, how they enrich our lives with meaning. The arts reach millions of people. The conversation that the public was invited to attend opened up an understanding, a common ground, for why we are all fighting for the importance and success of the arts in our communities.\n\nThese events have been thought provoking in multiple regards, not solely for feedback on proposal writing, but the larger context of the importance of the arts and encouraging participation in the conversations that are shaping our communities. After attending a few of the spring events the Ohio Arts Council planned, I can now firmly say the OAC is an invaluable resource for the community.\n\nA lot of things are changing and leading the arts in Ohio, and the Ohio Arts Council is a key one of them. I encourage you to attend these events in the future, most specifically the open panel reviews if you are ever afforded the opportunity, but whatever your scheduled permits, trust me you will not be disappointed!\n\nThe Ohio Arts Council\u00a0is a state agency that funds and supports quality arts experiences to strengthen Ohio communities culturally, educationally, and economically.

        "text":"archive: 15.02 Bjorn Melhus II\nBj\u00f8rn Melhus\nThe Theory of Freedom II\n\nOpen: Saturday 31 January until Saturday 28 February 2015\n\nWest proudly announces \u2018The Theory of Freedom\u2019, an ambitious presentation of German-Norwegian artist Bj\u00f8rn Melhus, to be held at different locations in Den Haag and Rotterdam. At Kunsthal Rotterdam, Part One sees the world premiere of the expanded cinema project \u2018The Theory of Freedom\u2019. At West in Den Haag, Part Two presents six video works that address surveillance and the politics of fear in mass media. Part Three takes the shape of a screening during the International Film Festival Rotterdam, which revisits five earlier works by Melhus.\n\nMelhus\u2019 depiction of everyday reality framed within non-fictional narratives blurs with the fictional and dramatized world. By mimicking well-known personalities, and mixing together popular culture motifs, and media strategies, he seduces and terrorizes the complicit observer of mainstream culture. In The Theory of Freedom II, the symbiotic and manipulative relationship between host and audience is disturbingly emphasized in surveillance and the politics of fear. He sharply observes and unnerves the nuances of mass media consumption to craft new scenarios that oscillates between dark and humorous. In \u2018The Oral Thing\u2019 (2001), he dissects sensationalism and voyeurism in televised religion and daytime talk shows, and agonizes over the slick editing techniques of blockbuster movie trailers in \u2018The Castle\u2019 (2007). While \u2018The City\u2019 (2007) evokes the feeling of impending threat with night shots of major cities flowing by one after the other. Similarly the spectator is then bombarded with terror and doom rhetoric in \u2018Sudden Destruction\u2019 (2012). In \u2018Policia\u2019, (2007) the competing forces for power vie for rapt attention. In \u2018Deadly Storms\u2019 (2008) US mainstream news journalism is paraded as propaganda transformed into a disembodied \u2018talking head\u2019 oracle. In The Theory of Freedom II Melhus skilfully deconstructs representations of power, faith, and paranoia that spill out into a murky and glistening alternate reality that is shockingly similar to our own.\n\nParallel events\nThe Theory of Freedom I\nKunsthal Rotterdam - 24 January to 1 March\n\nBj\u00f8rn Melhus examines various aspects of world religions, globalisation and neoliberal capitalism. He mixes the controversial neoliberal ideas of Russian-American writer and philosopher Ayn Rand (1905-1982) with stereotypical themes found in American mainstream films such as Armageddon. Melhus hugely magnifies familiar settings and his playful, humorous approach, together with a harsh dose of reality, provokes both laughter and pain. The multichannel installation, which is accompanied by the video work \u2018Heaven\u2019 (2013) and \u2018America Sells\u2019 (1990), takes to a new level the powerful, repetitive rhythms of the sound-bites that are so characteristic of Melhus\u2019 work. For further information see\nThe Theory of Freedom III\nInternational Film Festival Rotterdam - 24 January 10.30 h.\n\nDas Zauberglas (1991), Weit, Weit Weg (1995), Auto Center Drive (2003), Afterlife (2010) and I Am Not Your Enemy (2011) are screened during International Film Festival Rotterdam\u2019s short film program. The selected works address notions of subjective inner spaces, trauma, and identities.

Moderated by Liesbeth Levy (Lokaal, Rotterdam) with: Joost de Bloois, Hedwig Fijen, Pascal Gielen, Stefan Heidenreich, and Bj\u00f8rn Melhus. RSVP:\n\nBj\u00f8rn Melhus (1966, Kirchheim unter Teck, Germany) lives and works in Berlin. He has been presented and awarded at several international film festivals. He has had screenings in Tate Modern, London, LUX, London, Museum of Modern Art, New York and Centre Pompidou, Paris. In the exhibition context, he has shown at 54th Venice Biennale, Whitney Museum, New York; 8th Istanbul Biennial, as well as solo and groups shows at FACT Liverpool; Serpentine Gallery, London; Sprengel Museum, Hannover; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; ZKM, Karlsruhe and Denver Art Museum amongst others.\n\nFor more info, a meeting with the artist or press photos contact Eloise Sweetman: For additional information on the The Theory of Freedom at the Kunsthal Rotterdam contact Sabine Parmentier: 010-4400321, 06-52636232 or Marie\u0308tte Maaskant, 010-4400323;\n\nback to overview\narchive (online version)",

        "text":"C3 Initiative: \"Chester Made\" Information-Gathering Sessions\n\n19 - 28 Feb 2015\nCHESTER, Pennsylvania\n\n\nArtist-led story circles held by the Chester Cultural Corridor team created this downtown asset map of arts, culture and creative expression. Photo by Paul Fritz, Consulting City Planner.\n\nSupported by The Pew Center for Arts & Heritage, the Chester Cultural Corridor Initiative takes a novel approach to city planning, using theater and community dialogue to inform the revitalization of the Chester Cultural Corridor (C3) along Avenue of the States between City Hall and Widener University.\n\nA \"Chester Made\" Artist-Facilitator Ensemble will ask youth, seniors, artists, cultural leaders, healers, local historians, business owners, and Widener's campus\u2014and many more\u2014to share personal stories of meaningful cultural and creative experiences in Chester to map locations where \"art and culture happen.\" These stories will form the basis of a cultural asset map that will ensure \"Chester Made\" arts and culture are visible and celebrated\u2014and attract support for large-scale public art projects and other campaigns for cultural revitalization in the downtown corridor.\n\nDuring each of the five Information-Gathering Sessions, groups will share their stories in story circles, experience short image theater pieces based on those stories, and collectively reflect on shared values, experiences, and visions for creative expression and cultural engagement in Chester.\n\nThe overarching goal is to include and to hear from local community members who rarely attend public meetings or participate in traditional methods of data collection, in an effort to rebuild an overall positive community identity, and to create conditions for grassroots social change and economic development.\n\nFebruary 19, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.\nBoys & Girls Club of Chester\n201 East 7th Street, Chester, PA\n\nFebruary 21, 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.\nThe Artist Warehouse\n504 Edgemont Avenue, Chester, PA\n\nFebruary 26, 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.\nTrue Vine Missionary Full Gospel Baptist Church\n701 Morton Avenue, Chester, PA\n\nFebruary 27, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.\nChester Senior Center\n721 Hayes Street, Chester, PA\n\nFebruary 28, 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.\nEntrepreneur Works Delaware County\n1350 Edgemont Avenue, Suite 1300, Chester, PA",
