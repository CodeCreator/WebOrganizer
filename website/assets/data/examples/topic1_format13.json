Inspired by nature\u2019s ephemerality and its inimitable palettes, the artists engage with all stages of the plant life cycle, from seed to germination to decay, to interpret nature in sculptural form. \u201cBy design, floral artistry is meant to be more than pleasing to the eye,\u201d said Elissa Auther, Deputy Director of Curatorial Affairs and William and Mildred Lasdon Chief Curator. \u201cAs the artists expand the boundaries of materials and creative expression, they are also in dialogue with a variety of aesthetic traditions, from early modern European still life painting to the eighteenth-century picturesque to the hyperreality of the twenty-first-century digital realm\u2014all of which will be explored in the exhibition.\u201d\n\nEach week a new botanical artist will be featured in the Flower Craft gallery. The artists are:\n\nKristen Alpaugh is founder of Los Angeles-based FLWR PSTL, a studio whose high-profile clients include Katy Perry, SZA, and Doja Cat, as well as major cosmetic and fashion brands. Alpaugh melds botanicals with various media to tell unique and compelling stories. She was recently featured in HBOMax\u2019s floral competition series, Full Bloom.\n\nDoan Ly, founder of a.p. bio, is a multidisciplinary artist whose practice integrates the fields of floral design, photography, and video. Ly\u2019s work has been published in Vogue Spain, China, and Italy; The New Yorker;\u00a0The Atlantic;\u00a0and Kinfolk, among others. Her commercial clients include Moschino, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Carolina Herrera, Zara, and many more. Born in Vietnam, Ly immigrated to the United States at the age of eight and grew up in Minnesota.\n\nLutfi Janania is a Honduran botanical artist raised on a bioreserve among the rain forest and mountains in San Pedro Sula. His sculptures, comprised of exquisite dry and hydrated natural materials, are surreal, unrealized portraits of the artist\u2019s imagined worlds. Janania was the winner of season two of HBOMax\u2019s Full Bloom and his studio, ROSALILA, is located in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nNoritaka Noda is president of the Ikenobo Ikebana NYC Chapter, as well as the first and only US special professor recognized by the Ikenobo Headquarters in Kyoto, Japan. As a professor of Ikebana, he conducts demonstrations and teaches classes at the Nippon Club. Noda is known for his unusual arrangements, which combine traditional and modern materials in different scales. His clients include American and Japanese corporations, restaurants, retail, and museums.\n\nEmily Thompson is the founder of Emily Thompson Flowers in New York City. Born in Vermont, Thompson earned an MFA in sculpture from UCLA. Inspired by the eighteenth-century theory of the picturesque, she has designed dramatic naturalistic arrangements and installations for the Obama White House, MoMA\u2019s Modern restaurant, Bergdorf Goodman, T Magazine, Jason Wu, and other notable clients.\u00a0\n\nManu Torres is an artist based in Portland, Oregon. His floral arrangements often involve a dialogue between the artificial and the natural; incorporating paper, fabric, paint, and feathers to imitate and exaggerate natural beauty in a hyperreal way. His work has been featured in Elle Decor magazine and he was also named by Domino magazine as a top new floral designer to follow. His recent solo exhibition at Russo Lee Gallery was an ArtForum Critic's Pick.\n\nAlongside the ever-changing floral installations that are the heart of Flower Craft, there will be a curated selection of vessels in a range of mediums, complementing the emphasis on the craft and design of flower arrangement. Artists in this section of the exhibition include Emily Mullins and Jolie Ngo, as well as a video by Cauleen Smith. Titled Flowers for Virtually Nobody, it was filmed during the pandemic and captures Smith creating an arrangement that grows ever larger over the duration of the piece in commemoration of those lost to Covid-19. The exhibition also coincides with MAD\u2019s first-ever \u201cbee residency,\u201d newly installed on the Museum roof. Two hives are now homes for \u201cQueen Aileen,\u201d named for the industrious founder of MAD, Aileen Osborn Webb, and \u201cQueen Toshiko Takaezu,\u201d named for the famed female ceramic artist and dedicated supporter of MAD. The queens are attended by a mob of drones to keep them warm, pollinate, and make honey.\n\n\nDuring the run of the exhibition, the Flower Craft gallery will function as a studio classroom for MAD\u2019s Flower Craft Atelier taught by the Flower Craft artists, as well as a variety of intergenerational workshops.\u00a0 Surrounded by the extraordinary display of innovative floral design, audiences of all ages and skill levels will be able to explore floral creativity with an inspiring collective of artists and designers.\n\nFlower Craft Atelier: Kristen Alpaugh\nTuesday, May 17, 6\u20138 pm\nThe Los Angeles-based botanical artist and contestant on the hit HBOMax series Full Bloom leads a floral-design workshop inspired by the fantastical, color-filled world of her FLWR PSTL studio.\n\nFlower Craft Atelier: Noritaka Noda\nTuesday, May 24, 6\u20138 pm\nAcclaimed Ikebana scholar Noritaka Noda leads a workshop immersion in ikenobo ikebana, an ancient artistic tradition that Noda has famously modernized.\n\nFlower Craft Atelier: Lufti Janania\nTuesday, May 31, 6\u20138 pm\nWinner of season two of the HBOMax hit series Full Bloom, botanical artistJanania leads a floral-design workshop inspired by the sensual aesthetic of his creative studio, ROSALILA.\n\nFlower Craft Atelier: Manu Torres\nTuesday, June 14, 6\u20138 pm\nBotanical artist Manu Torres leads a workshop in his avant-garde approach to floral design inspired by his rock-star Rococo aesthetic.\n\nFloral Wearables with Debra Rapoport\nThursday, May 26, 6\u20138 pm\nMultidisciplinary artist Debra Rapoport leads a workshop in constructing floral headdresses, fascinators, and adornments using recycled materials, paint, and glue.\n\nFamily Workshop: Silk Flowers\nSunday, June 5, 10:30 am\u201312 pm\nLearn how to upcycle silk flowers into wearable statement pieces with the community-based nonprofit BloomAgainBklyn and guest floral designers.\n\nFloral Charms with L\u0113 Matthew x Degrade\nSaturday, June 11, 2\u20134 pm\nEco-creative L\u0113 Matthew, founder of Degrade, the experimental slow-fashion label promoting biodegradable materials and textile explorations, will lead a workshop using petals, leaves, and other organic waste sourced from Flower Craft to create personal floral charms.\n\nGiving Back with Blooms\nTuesday, June 7, 2\u20134 pm\nFlower Craft blooms will be repurposed into individual arrangements to be distributed to the city\u2019s most vulnerable during this in-gallery workshop with BloomAgainBklyn, the community-based nonprofit.\n\nContemporary Trends in Floral Design\nTuesday, June 21, 7\u20138 pm\nA conversation and demonstration with Flower Craft artist Emily Thompson and Nancy Hass, writer at large for T: The New York Times Style Magazine.

The app platform is part of Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 longstanding commitment to supporting digital innovation in the arts. On the app, visitors will be able to listen to the exhibition artists describe their process, watch video of the installations as they are created on site, and sign up for classes and workshops.\n\n\nFlower Craft is curated by Deputy Director of Curatorial Affairs and William and Mildred Lasdon Chief Curator Elissa Auther and Sarah Bedford, founder and creative director of Bedford & Co.\n\nFlower Craft is made possible by the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature.\n\nThis program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council.\n\n\nThe Museum of Arts and Design (MAD) champions contemporary makers across creative fields and presents the work of artists, designers, and artisans who apply the highest level of ingenuity and skill. Since the Museum's founding in 1956 by philanthropist and visionary Aileen Osborn Webb, MAD has celebrated all facets of making and the creative processes by which materials are transformed, from traditional techniques to cutting-edge technologies.

Minosa\u2122 has been recognised for their luxurious work on a Dover Heights residence.\n\n\nWhen taking on this project, Minosa\u2122 wanted to create interior spaces that seamlessly integrated into the amazing arch\n\nitecture of the building. When looking for the right materials to use \u2013 Minosa\u2122 used Corian\u00ae throughout the kitchen, bathrooms, outdoor area and home theatre.\n\nMinosa\u2122 created three dream bathroom spaces, adopting a feeling of endless luxury and warmth. Using products from the Minosa\u2122 Bathroom Collection allowed them to create an environment that is aesthetically and functionally pleasing. A Double Scoop\u00ae, Scoop\u00ae and The Puddle\u00ae washbasins are all a part of these grand designs all made entirely with Corian\u00ae Solid Surfaces. An art-like unique mosaic feature wall also complements and highlights the Scoop washbasin.\u201cThe Puddle\u00ae, Scoop\u00ae & Double Scoop\u00ae washbasins where chosen to support the very linear & cantilevering nature of the home\u201d, says Simona.The Status bath is also a highlight feature in one of the bathrooms with it\u2019s Corian\u00ae bath surround. It was chosen to complement the Double Scoop\u00ae washbasin, and the style box like nature of the architecture. A minimalist and grand kitchen space was created and Corian\u00ae in Glacier White colour was used on the kitchen benchtops. A custom made dining table was also created with Corian\u00ae that extends to seat another four people.\u201cCorian\u00ae was chosen in the kitchen for its amazing integrity and so we could create work surfaces that are completely seamless and easy to use & care for\u201d, says Darren.The use of Corian\u00ae also extends to the home\u2019s outdoor area. The Utzon BBQ by Electrolux was made in Glacier White colour to match the kitchen, creating a truly integrated feel from the kitchen to the outdoors.\n\n\u201cCorian\u00ae gives us incredible flexibility when creating products and interiors; our bathroom collection is a testament to this. Corian\u00ae allows us to design bold & beautiful washbasins through to stylish organic forms\u201d, says Darren.\n\n\u201cWith Corian\u00ae we are confident our products are durable, practical and completely renewable\u201d, adds Simona.Congratulations to Minosa\u2122 for this outstanding Corian\u00ae Design Award win, and for\u00a0the creation of\u00a0this majestic interior.\n\n\nSearch Minosa\n\nBlog Archive",

And let it be known, that Victor Hugo would finish off his drawings with a spray of coffee and sometimes created art from coffee\n\n    Now artists are taking inspiration from coffee ephemera (filters, stirrers, to-go cups, spoons and sleeves)--from Miguel Cardona's cup art to the \"stirring\" sculptures of Jonathan Brilliant to the fine doodles from DrawCoffee.\n\n\n    And so\u2026 we're calling on all you artists (outsiders, insiders, doodlers, crafters, students, painters, potters, poets, songwriters, all) to use anything coffee-related as an inspiration for art--big or small--to be shown\/performed at a big, caffeinated party\/exhibition February 8th 3-5pm\u00a0with prizes, press and more.\u00a0\n\n    There are no restrictions other than the finished work should be made out of coffee ephemera or inspired by coffee and be completed by the beginning of February 2015. We've already got responses from a dozen artists (including a school that is participating), so hoping that this will truly be an event.\u00a0\n\n    If you're interested in participating, please contact us at: hello@sixdepot.com.
