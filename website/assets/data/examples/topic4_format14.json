I feel that learning Japanese at LC has helped me get to where I am today and has opened the door to working in Japan which was always a goal of mine. One of the many highlights from learning Japanese at LC was probably studying abroad in Osaka. LC Japanese language students are lucky in that we get 4 different Japanese study abroad programs to choose from! Studying abroad really helped with my language skills and created an unforgettable experience.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I studied abroad in Osaka at Osaka Gakuin Daigaku, and although the program was very language intensive, the fact that we got to room with other Japanese college students was amazing. It allowed my Japanese skills to really improve and since my roommates were other Japanese students it allowed me to make a lot of friends! Now whenever I visit Osaka I always have friends to go back to.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0To me, the Japanese professors I had at LC were great and always made class fun but challenging. This really pushed me to study hard and really learn the language. Because of the wonderful experience I\u2019ve had studying Japanese at LC, it has pushed me to want to learn more languages. I think it\u2019s very important to at least try and learn more languages. From learning Japanese and studying\/working abroad I definitely feel like my perspective on the world has widened and it has made a strong but positive impact on the way I think.",

        "text":"About the Blog and Me\n\nGame Theori was started as a means to have an informed opinion looking at all aspects of an issue.\n\nGame Theory, that talked about cause and effect, action and reaction, was the inspiration for the name and also it suited my passion and profession.\n\nHaving been a part of the market & industry research, information analysis and knowledge management industry for more than 10 years, my writings and podcasts are influenced by the same. One could say that my passion and profession converged and blogging and podcasting became the road on which I continue my self-discovery.\n\nMarket research, industry research, knowledge and information management, social media, political analysis, technology, consulting; are some of the topics that interest me. It interests me to know how these things impact our daily lives and business decisions such as branding, advertising, marketing, product & service design and public relations.\n\nBeing a part of the information age has also made me look at all technology and its evolution from the legacy internet on dial-up connection to the present day wireless connection and touch based applications that is driving the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data revolution towards driver-less cars and extreme automation.\n\nMy interests drive my blog and podcasts and I continue discovering new things through reading and research.\n\nThis has fueled a habit of projecting the future and then testing the projection through direct observation.\n\nWhy Game Theori?\n\nIt started as an experiment to share ones thoughts. Over time it has also enabled a personal learning with a desire to make it a platform for professionals from all industries to share their knowledge and learning to guide new entrants into industry and make the transition from academia to industry smooth.\n\nSo if you are a person or an organization interested in such topics do stick around and if you have a demand for a particular topic do let me know.\n\nI would love to work with other professionals and organizations on solutions that have tangible impact and benefit. I can be contacted at sriram@gametheori.com and I look forward to suggestions as well as constructive criticism to improve.",
