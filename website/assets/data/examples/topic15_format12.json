        "text":"Home > The Factory\n\nThe Factory\n\n\nWe are specialists in high quality nutrition for dogs and cats. We have one of the most modern pet food factories in Latin America, which was founded 19 years ago, and is a pioneer in the Super Premium food segment in Brazil. Constant investments in technology, infrastructure, innovation and personnel guarantee the status of a cutting-edge industrial complex located in a total area of 552 thousand m2 in the city of Dourado (SP).\n\n\nPackaging machines, coating systems, extruders, dosage systems, dryers, mills, among others, were imported from the best international suppliers.\nOur Quality Control has a lab for physico-chemical analyses, and is a reference in methodology and equipment. It works exclusively to analyse our raw materials, products and the cleanliness control of our equipment. It takes up an area of over 300 m2 and has a team trained to do bromatological and microbiological analyses.\n\n\nAnd from September 2016, a new factory has started operating on site, built exclusively for the production of cookies, and marking our arrival in the snack segment.\n\nWe\u2019ve invested heavily over the past 2 years in order to develop our new factory operations. Equipment was tested and brought from several different parts of the world to satisfy the demand for the production of the unique cookies from the PremieR Cookie line, formulated exclusively by the team of veterinarians, specialized in nutrition that work at the Nutritional Development Center (Centro de Desenvolvimento Nutricional \u2013 CDN).\n\nREVERSE LOGISTICS \u2013 Return of packaging\n\nPremieRpet\u00ae is fully aware of its socio-environmental role, and has made collection spots available, so that the disposal of its packaging be done adequately, with no harm to the environment. Get in touch with PremieRpet Responde for more information on the location of collection spots:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0800 55 6666 \u2013 Monday to Friday, from 8h30 to 17h30.\n\n\nThe cookie factory is a 7,700 m2 building, where a very high quality production process guarantees strict quality control of raw materials (PremieRpet\u00ae guarantee of excellence) and a high level of automation in the processes. The formulas are typed into a computerized system, the ingredients are carefully weighed on individual, high-precision scales, transported by a combination of pneumatic and closed carrier systems that ensure efficiency and security throughout the process.\n\nOne of the highlights is the mixer, where all the ingredients are blended, a unique piece of equipment in the Brazilian market, imported from Italy and used in the production of cookies for humans. The closed carrier system which transports the ingredients isolates the raw materials and prevents contact with the environment, thereby improving food safety. And the multiple phase system ensures that each ingredient reaches the mixer in the exact order and moment it needs to be added to the mix.\n\nOnce the mix is ready, it goes to the molding process \u2013 and not lamination, as occurs in the production of most snacks in Brazil. This process guarantees more precision for perfect cuts and shapes that are well-formed, not wasteful, and with the adequate product texture. In the next phase, the cookie goes straight into the oven to be baked \u2013 and not extruded, which represents another unique PremieRpet\u00ae feature. It\u2019s about using the same process adopted when making cookies for humans, which provides more palatability (flavor) and makes the cookies bake in an absolutely uniform manner.\n\nThe cookies are placed into special 250g packages, with our Easy Open System, that helps consumers open it with ease, and the Open\/Close System, a zipper function that allows for more conservation of flavor, aroma and crunchiness. And there you go! The market has just received a unique, innovative product.\n\nThis production process ensures exclusive, nutritious cookies with very high quality ingredients, baked and molded into unique and exclusive formats akin to the human standard of care and quality.\n\n\nSince its foundation, PremieRpet\u00ae has had its actions directed towards sustainability, and this new factory couldn\u2019t be any different. We even went further and spared no effort to make sure that the unit is 100% aligned with our values, incorporating a socio-environmental dimension from the ground up, becoming a renowned, pioneering example in the segment.\n\n\nThe project had expert labor and consultancy, which were completely directed towards a sustainable building and operations. The result deserves to be celebrated: the cookie factory has already started operating under a LEED Certification \u2013 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, considered the main seal for green buildings in Brazil and used in 143 countries.\n\nA factory with a LEED New Construction Certification is the guarantee of a high-performance, sustainable building with international recognition. This achievement reflects the values that have long been present at PremieRpet\u00ae from the environmental point of view, and also from the social aspect, making it clear that the company is very conscientious of its employees\u2019 health and safety, as well as the satisfaction and well-being of the consumers of the products made in the factory.\n\n\nIn order to get the LEED New Construction Certification, the factory went through a rigorous evaluation that considered seven issues: sustainable terrain, rational use of water, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, project innovation, and attention to the regional priorities of suppliers. It was a great challenge, so much so that no other factory in our segment has gained this certification in Brazil. But with great effort we were able to fulfill the requisites and we can celebrate this pioneering achievement.\n\nAmong the investments is the construction of two lakes for the collection of rainwater. Part of the water collected is for sanitation and part for irrigation, promoting control of the quantity and quality of the water returned to the environment. The installation of a roof with an area for water collection and flow restriction (washbasins, taps and urinals) also had an impact on the results, and all the initiatives put together generated over 20% economy in the total consumption of water and 50% in the use of fresh water for landscaping. The industrial process doesn\u2019t generate effluents and the little water that is used cleaning the lines is treated in a private treatment center. We\u2019ve achieved an exemplary hydric balance and generate excellent savings.\n\nOur efforts were also targeted at energy efficiency, which is monitored daily. We had already been using thermal energy from boilers powered by wood chips, leftovers from the eucalyptus trees planted on our own farm, thereby closing the zero carbon emission cycle. The electrical energy, as per contract with the supplier, was already a product of 100% renewable sources, from small hydroelectric centers and windfarms. In the new factory, the materials were chosen carefully to promote even more efficiency. Glass, LED lights, translucid shingles, among others. The exchange of flourescent lightbulbs for LED lights alone generated savings of 10% of the total consumption. Even private transportation for employees was upgraded and a bicycle rack\/shed was created to contribute to the reduction of car use and the CO2 emissions in the region.\n\nOur construction prioritized materials and resources of low environmental impact, as well as residue management from the construction site, which were sent not to landfills, but to recyling centers with a goal of 75%. We adopted 10% of recycled content such as concrete, steel and aluminum, and 20% of material acquired by regional suppliers, favoring the development of the regional economy and saving on transportation and CO2 emissions.\n\nOn the issue of indoor environmental quality, materials with low emissions of volatile organic components (such as paint, stickers, coating and sealers from Eucatex), air flow, ventilation and smoke monitoring, thermal comfort with lighting control according to environment and work post were prioritized. We promoted natural light in 75% of the space and 90% of the occupied areas have a line of sight and access to the landscape.\n\nAfter 2 years of investments we are proud to have achieved the LEED New Construction seal for the new factory operations and to have started the production on the new line of PremieR Cookies. They are unique products, from the conceptualization to all the stages of manufacturing. The result couldn\u2019t have been any different: another success case by PremieRpet\u00ae and an innovation in the snack segment.\n\nPremium Or Super Premium\n\nAll foods will feed animals, but not all help to maintain health, quality of life and beauty because they don\u2019t have the same properties.
