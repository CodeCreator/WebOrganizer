SES has provided environmentally safe encasement systems to homes, schools, hospitals, historic buildings, government facilities, commercial and industrial sites throughout the USA and Canada.In recent years, more and more people have come to realize that the quality of the air we breathe can largely determine our personal health and well-being. There have been many examples of materials being used in the construction of pre-1978 homes and buildings that, over time, have proven to be a threat to our personal health and safety, as well as to our environment. In determining options to solve these challenges, the Federal Government established, published and applied Federal-Standards for effective abatement methods. The four approved abatement methods are: a) total removal and replacement, b) enclosure, c) encapsulation and d) encasement. Of these four accepted abatement solutions; encasement is the one that is less disruptive, meaning that the process of installing an encasement system over these obsolete building surfaces, can be done without disturbing toxic dusts or fibers. Encasement can also save the end user 50% to 80% versus other abatement methods, and can often be completed in one-third of the time.\n\nbio image img-responsive lazyload\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n4344 San Cascina Street\nLas Vegas , Nevada , 89135\nUnited States\n\nAttention corrosion industry professionals - sign up here to join the directory.",

The company owns 17 mines in three states and employs more than 1,200 people.\n\nIn August 2009, United Coal Company moved into its new corporate headquarters at 110 Sprint Drive in Blountville, Tenn. A staff of 34 employees work out of the Blountville office, which combines all corporate activities and executives in one location, including legal counsel, risk management, accounting, purchasing, information technology, human resources and sales \u2013 departments previously located in Teays Valley, W.Va., and Bristol, Va.\n\nHeadquartered in Blountville, Tenn., the company operates six subsidiaries in three states:\n\nKentucky Operations\n\n  \u2022 Sapphire Coal Company \u2013 Whitesburg, Ky.\n\nVirginia Operations\n\n  \u2022 Wellmore Coal Company \u2013 Big Rock, Va.\n\nWest Virginia Operations\n\n  \u2022 Affinity Coal Company \u2013 Midway, W.Va.\n  \u2022 Carter Roag Coal Company \u2013 Mill Creek, W.Va.\n  \u2022 Pocahontas Coal Company \u2013 Beckley, W.Va.\n  \u2022 Roaring Creek Coal Company \u2013 Elkins W. Va.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, United Coal Company launched its third subsidiary in West Virginia, Affinity Coal Company, by opening an idled coal mine and constructing a new preparation plant. Affinity is a key addition to UCC and its parent company, Metinvest \u2013 providing high-quality metallurgical coal for global markets.\n\nLocated in Midway, W.Va., Affinity\u2019s 1,000 ton-per-hour preparation plant is supported by a reopened coal mine that was operational in the 1930s. The project brings 250-plus jobs to the area and represents a significant investment \u2013 $115 million \u2013 in the local economy. \u00a0Affinity is a vital contributor to West Virginia\u2019s tax base, at an estimated $4.5 million per year.\n\nThis leading metallurgical coal mine is meeting the ever-changing demands of the steel industry, producing 1.4 million tons* per year at full production, using four super-section, continuous miner units. Approximately 50 percent* of the coal produced at Affinity is used for domestic steel production. Affinity coal reserves total 40 million* clean tons.\n\n\n\nCarter Roag Coal Company has operated as a subsidiary of United Coal Company since 2004, when UCC purchased permitted reserves in Randolph and Upshur counties in West Virginia. The property had produced mid- to high-volatile metallurgical Sewell coal for several decades.\n\nCarter Roag now has more than 100 employees and mines 600,000 tons of coal annually. The company operates one deep mine \u2013 Pleasant Hill \u2013 located near Mill Creek, W.Va. Pleasant Hill is the only operating underground mine in Randolph County. Carter Roag\u2019s coal preparation facility, the Star Bridge plant near Helvetia, W.Va., is a 500-ton-per-hour operation.\n\n\nIn 2005, United Coal Company purchased the assets of Beckley, W.Va.-based White Mountain Mining Co., LLC and certain affiliates to establish Pocahontas Coal Company. Pocahontas employs more than 230 people, with operations in the communities of Killarney, Josephine and Lillybrook located in southern Raleigh County, W.Va.\n\nThe company\u2019s annual coal production capacity is more than 1 million tons, with reserves totaling 72 million recoverable tons of low-volatile metallurgical coal.\n\nPocahontas has three deep mines, a surface mine and two highwall miner operations. These mining operations are supported by the recently upgraded East Gulf preparation plant and coal-loading facilities.\n\n\n\nSapphire Coal Company was formed in 2004 out of the former assets of Golden Oak Mining and Cook & Sons Mining in Letcher County. Sapphire now employs more than 200 people and ships more than 1 million clean tons of coal a year.\n\nWith operations located in Letcher and Knott counties, Sapphire\u2019s primary focus is the production of high Btu steam coal from the traditional eastern Kentucky strata, including the Hazard, Amburgy, Elkhorn and Whitesburg seams.\n\nSapphire\u2019s operations include two underground mines and one surface mine \u2013 UZ, Advantage and Smoot Creek Surface. Sapphire\u2019s upgraded 1,100-ton-per-hour preparation plant is one of the largest and most efficient operations of its kind in eastern Kentucky. The plant is on the same site as the high-speed, four-hour unit train loadout served by the CSX line.\n\nWe continue to expand our coal reserves and seek opportunities to develop new mines.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, United Coal Company purchased The Rapoca Group, LLC, headquartered in Bristol, Va., and renamed the operation Wellmore Coal Company in recognition of United Coal\u2019s origins in Buchanan County.\n\nWellmore has both company-owned and contract operations that include two company-operated underground mines, five company-operated surface mines, seven contract mines, three shops, two preparation plants and rail-loading facilities, a lab and administration office \u2013 for a total of 360 employees.\n\nThe company\u2019s reserves, which total more than 55 million tons, are primarily mid\/high-volatile metallurgical reserves and low-sulfur steam reserves in the Splashdam, Banner, Glamorgan, Jawbone and Hagy seams. Wellmore\u2019s deep and surface mining operations are located throughout Buchanan, Tazewell and Dickenson counties in Southwest Virginia, with additional reserves located in Pike County, Ky., and McDowell County, W.Va.\n\nThe company\u2019s Splashdam reserves are some of the most sought-after mid\/high-volatile metallurgical coals in the Central Appalachian basin \u2013 supplying both domestic and international markets. Wellmore produces approximately 1.8 million tons of coal and is poised to re-emerge as a dominant supplier of mid\/high-volatile metallurgical coal.",
