        "text":"Steve Poleskie with his first airplane, a Champion Citabria 7ECA, 1972\n\n\nTeaching Myself to Fly an Airplane\n\n\nby Stephen Poleskie\n\nWhen I mentioned that I was writing an article about teaching myself to fly, my friend asked: \u201cWho do you think you are, Leonardo da Vinci?\u201d So I know a clever person, who must have read Leonardo\u2019s notebooks. In case you haven\u2019t read these texts, when he wasn\u2019t working on paintings, murals, or designing war machines, Leonard often made drawings for devices to get himself into the sky. Most of these involved jumping from a castle tower into the moat below. Thus, some people credit da Vinci with inventing the parachute.\n\nI explained to my young friend that the flying article was actually more about my being an autodidact, a word he surprisingly was not familiar with. I suppose that in this day and age, when one is encouraged to stay in school until you can\u2019t borrow any more money, a \u201cself-taught person\u201d is a bit of an anomaly. I take pride in having taught myself everything that was important to me, including screen printing, which I learned by reading a pamphlet given out free by a Sherwin Williams paint store in Pennsylvania and then taught at Cornell University for 33 years.\n\nMy flying story begins in a deer stand. When I moved up to Ithaca from New York City, I can\u2019t say that I wasn\u2019t bored. I did miss my evenings at Max\u2019s, gallery openings, and the rest of the NYC art world milieu. In my free time I began doing the things that people did in the fall in upstate New York. One of these activities was deer hunting.\n\nI won\u2019t elaborate how I got into a deer stand, crouched waiting for my friends to flush out a buck to come running from the neighboring fields for me to shoot. However, I will say that I was uncomfortable; cold, cramped and bored. And then I heard a familiar sound. I looked up and saw a small airplane passing overhead. This was it \u2014 that is where I should be; up there in the clear blue sky. I loved airplanes, having flown models in my youth, and even taken a few flying lessons. I jumped out of my hiding place, ran for my truck and drove to the local airport.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s December,\u201d Mr. H, the chief flight instructor and owner of the flying school reminded me. \u201cNo one learns to fly in the winter, the weather\u2019s too bad. Come back in the spring.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I want to start right now,\u201d I insisted, full of enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cOkay, come back on the next nice day, in the meantime buy this book,\u201d Mr. H snarled, sliding a tome across his desk, \u201cand learn everything in it before you come around again. You will notice that my name is mentioned in the acknowledgements.\u201d Alas, I had met a man who had a bigger ego than mine.\n\nMy lessons went well. I was working with a flight instructor named Rogie. I could take off and land and in a short time was allowed to do this all by myself; flying solo it\u2019s called. The problem came when I asked Rogie to teach me how to do spins. Spins were no longer in the curriculum, Rogie explained. It seems that too many pilots had crashed practicing spins, so the FAA had decided pilots no longer needed to know spin recovery techniques. The theory was that if you never got into a spin you would not need to know how to get out of one. But if someone accidentally got into a spin and didn\u2019t know how to recover, well that was just too bad. I convinced Rogie to demonstrate a spin and recovery, which he did. I can still recall the terror on his face as we rotated one turn, which was all he would do.\n\nBut I was hooked. I loved the experience. I had grown tired of practicing takeoffs and landings and turns about a point. Whenever I was sent off solo I would go out to the practice area and climb to a safe altitude, and then spin the airplane to my heart\u2019s content.\n\nAs part of the curriculum, I had to take a check ride with the chief flight instructor, the owner, Mr. H. When we were taxiing out I noticed that the artificial horizon was malfunctioning. This is an instrument one used to keep the wings level when flying blind, that is in fog or clouds without ground reference.\n\nWe got to the end of the taxiway and I did a run up, checking the engine gauges and magnetos prior to take off. Then Mr. H told me to taxi back to the hangar. I had failed the check ride, he informed me, because I had taxied out with an inoperable artificial horizon.\n\nI argued that as it was a perfectly clear day we would have no need for the artificial horizon. Then I revealed what would be my downfall. I explained that whenever I spun the airplane the artificial horizon tumbled, but always came back. I didn\u2019t know at the time that aerobatic airplanes had non-tumbling instruments, and this Piper was not an aerobatic airplane.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the one who has been spinning my airplanes!\u201d Mr. H screeched, adding, \u201cYou are out of my flying school. You are a menace to yourself and everyone around you. You have no business being in an airplane.\u201d\n\nKicked out; so what was I to do? The only other flying school on the field was a flying club, and I was not a joiner. I had enough of meetings back at my college department. If no one would teach me how to fly I would teach myself. But to do that I would need to have an airplane, and the two flying schools were the only ones on this field who rented aircraft. I decided that I would have to buy an airplane.\n\nI found it in a hangar at an airport in Pennsylvania, a Champion Citabria 7ECA. This was a real aerobatic airplane, if only a beginner\u2019s model, and it was used, which put it in my price range. I took a demonstration ride, and we did a few loops, rolls and spins. I would be back next week with the money. As the Citabria was based on an older design and had its third wheel on the rear, I would also need to be checked out for flying a tail wheel aircraft.\n\nHow I accomplished this frenzied project I cannot recall. But I do remember visits to my bank manager, and taking time with a local free-lance flight instructor who owned a tail wheel airplane. I got a friend to fly me down to Pennsylvania. I would be flying home in my own aerobatic airplane.\n\nThe transaction was complete. The local flight instructor, who had demonstrated the Citabria to me, checked me out in the airplane. After a few take offs and landings, at the small grass field wedged between a mountain and a river, the instructor got out. He shook my hand and wished me a good flight home. I told him I needed one more thing, a log book endorsement for the cross-country flight. You see student pilots, which I still was, couldn\u2019t go flying off anywhere without an endorsement from their flight instructor. I remember the concerned look on the man\u2019s face. He was reluctant to sign my log book because of my limited experience. Then he must have remembered the commission on the sale he would lose if I backed out of the deal. He signed.\n\nI taxied out and took off. The landing would be no problem I thought, since the airport that I was headed for was a mile long and paved. As the Citabria climbed out I reached into the door pocket for a chart. To my surprise there was none there. The flying school airplanes always had charts in the door pocket, but this was my airplane and neither I nor the previous owner had supplied one. I turned back, but the runway at the airport I had just departed looked so short. I decided to head for home. I knew the way without a chart, I had driven it: follow the river to Binghamton and then head northwest until I see Lake Cayuga. The airport is on the East side of the lake.\n\nSuccessfully arrived in Ithaca, I parked my Citabria on the ramp and went inside the Fixed Base Office to arrange for fuel and hangar space. Mr. H was inside looking out the window. Spying me he gestured for me to come over. He pointed to the strange Citabria on the ramp. \u201cNow there\u2019s a real airplane,\u201d he said, \u201cIf you ever learn how to fly, and get good enough, some day you might be able to fly something like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my airplane,\u201d I revealed. \u201cI just bought it in Pennsylvania and flew it here.\u201d\n\nMr. H glared at me, an expression of disbelief on his face. \u201cI suggest you return that airplane to whoever you bought it from and get your money back before you kill yourself in it, \u201c he said, turning and walking away.\n\nI didn\u2019t take his advice.\n\n\n\nAbout the author:\n\nStephen Poleskie\u2019s writing has appeared in journals in Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, the Philippines, and the\u00a0UK, as well as in the USA, and in three anthologies, including The Book of Love, (W.W.

And they belonged to people not only in City Hall, but also in Sacramento. What the heck was going on here? This was just a friggin' parking lot. There couldn't be the amount of money involved to interest folks at that altitude. Or could there?\n\n\nI figured it was time to get some more information from Betty. She had been in the parking business for 30 years. If anyone knew about parking, it was Betty. When my wife and assistant Shirley returned from making the phone call, she had a funny look on her face.\n\n\n\"Betty wasn't too forthcoming. She sounded frightened. She told me she was very busy and couldn't afford the time to talk to us. I think someone got to her. She did say, however, that perhaps we might want to talk to Marilyn North. She is an auditor and a former parking operator who works out of Seattle. Betty did give me her number. When I called, I found that she was actually here in L.A. working on a job. She'll be here in an hour.\"\n\n\n\"Wow,\" I said. \"That's a lot in just two phone calls. We have to be careful. We don't want it to look like we are 'investigating' anything. This has to be just a social call. It might be better if we met her at Paulo's. The office may be under some kind of surveillance.\"\n\n\n\"Right, I'll call her back.\"\n\n\nI thought it best if only Paulo and I met with North. That way, only our licenses were in jeopardy. Our major operative, Jim Walsh, was planning to continue to follow up with his contacts in the LAPD. I told him to go home and await developments. No need for all of us to be at risk of permanent unemployment. Shirley stayed to cover the phones, and discretion being the, well, you know, I decided I would drive. After the run down the hill to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center a couple of days ago with Paulo, I didn't want to take any chances.\n\n\nPaul Junior lived in a small house on a canal in Venice. Yes, there really are canals in Venice, California. In 1904, a developer named Abbot Kinney actually built a representation of Venice, Italy, on the Southern California coast just south of Santa Monica -- complete with canals, bridges and all the trimmings. Some of the canals were filled in about 1929, but a several remain, and small \"California bungalows\" line the waterways.\n\n\nSome bungalows are original 1920s; others have been gentrified to multimillion-dollar mansions, with designs ranging from a Hansel and Gretel \"witch's house\" to chrome, glass and steel. One might wonder how Paulo could afford such a place. It was left to him by my aunt when she passed away a few years ago. It was of the original design, and he kept all the wonderful feel of the '20s.\n\n\nMarilyn North arrived just behind us. She was 50ish, stocky, and in control. She stuck out her had and introduced herself. \"Marilyn North. You must be Paul Manning; who's the kid?\" I introduced my son.\n\n\n\"So,\" she asked, \"what do you want to know?\"\n\n\nWe sat on Paulo's front porch overlooking the canal. I told her the story and where we were, which was basically nowhere.\n\n\n\"Well, most people don't understand that parking generates a huge amount of money,\" North said. \"We are talking billions, maybe as many as 20 billion, nationwide. A single location could take in between half a million and a million dollars or more each year. There is room for temptation to step in, plus a lot of room for error. Most parking operators try to do a good job, but the owners drive down the fees they get so much that it's difficult to perform. You know that the manager of a McDonald's makes six figures, while a parking manager of a location grossing the same amount might make 50K on a good day.\n\n\n\"The other problem is taxes. With so much money floating around, folks want to keep as much as they can,\" North said. \"So they don't report all the income, and thus don't pay the 10% tax. This has two advantages: the obvious one of taking home more, but the other is more subtle. If legitimate operators pay their taxes and an illegitimate one like your buddy William Francis Smith doesn't, he has a 10% advantage when he bids a job. He can bid it at 10% less and still make the same amount of profit. And we are talking about a lot of money here. On one of those million-dollar locations, that's a hundred grand right on the bottom line.\"\n\n\n\"But,\" I asked, \"how can they put so much pressure on the government that my license has been pulled?\"\n\n\n\"Well, when you have that much cash, you can spread it around downtown and at the state capital. Smith has his tentacles into a lot of pies, not just parking. It's to his advantage to support the right council members and state legislators. My guess is that with two phone calls, he cut you off at the knees.\"\n\n\n\"Any idea where we should go from here?\"\n\n\n\"I'm auditing one of Smith's locations right now. I'm working for the owner who got suspicious. It's a real mess. The skimming is in six figures, maybe more. Perhaps I can put some pressure on Smith and he might make a mistake.\"\n\n\n\"What do you think the guys were doing on the roof of that garage when they were spotted by Grace Lundquist?\"\n\n\n\"They were the bagmen for LaFlonza, Smith and his cronies at City Hall. Those sacks being exchanged were filled with cash. My guess is that the garage was a convenient location and they thought they were safe - they just never looked up. They probably have moved the drop to somewhere else by now.\"\n\n\nAs we sat there considering what had been said, a blond woman in her late 50s walked up. She was shadowed by two gorillas. She looked very familiar. When she spoke, her accent -- like that of a she-wolf from the slopes of Mt. Etna, but soft, like the moonlight on the Spanish steps -- was unmistakable.\n\n\n\"We meet again, Mr. Manning. Your son is a handsome young man, but too young for me now. But I digress. No, remain seated, this will take only a minute. You have a choice. Stop what you are doing immediately or you will certainly lose your business, and maybe your lives. I know where you and your beautiful wife live, I know where your son lives, and you know I can deliver on what I say.\" Maria LaFlonza walked away.\n\n\nNorth looked at me and cracked a cold smile. \"You sure know how to stir up trouble, don't you, Manning.\"\n\n\n\n\nParking Today Subscribe BANNER",

        "text":"My first time driving on the turnpike\n\nEssay by dcarmonaCollege, UndergraduateA-, November 2008\n\ndownload word file, 3 pages 4.3\n\nDownloaded 2079 times\n\nI had recently taken my practical Driver License exam. I had taken it in an empty parking lot, quite different from the crowded expressways, and very comfortable for first time drivers. For the exam, I drove a compact, black, brand-new, rented Toyota Yaris. It was the lightest car I have ever driven. Amazingly, I felt comfortable inside it! I was not nervous at that moment. That day, I was driving on the Turnpike South Extension North, from Homestead to Miami. I learned how to drive with an automatic vehicle, a red Ford Ranger which was heavy and seemed non responsive. The turnpike was only way I knew how to get to Miami. So, in few seconds I made the decision to go there to seek for employment without considering the fact that I did not know how to drive properly.\n\nNaturally, I was nervous, regardless of my boyfriend was guiding me.\n\nInside the car, he started off by explaining how I have to change lanes, pass a car, and maintain the same speed. Suddenly, I became scared of every driver who passed by. Five seconds after I took the expressway, I showed him my clammy palms, and he kindly handed me a tissue. My entirely body was shaking like a leaf moved by the wind. I could feel the adrenaline circulating by my bloodstream. I was hot, but at the same time a cold sweat had covered me. My heart was beating so quickly that I felt like a thousands race horses were inside of my chest; all of them going in different directions. Also, my shoulders and neck were a bit tight and contracted. For just few seconds I turned my eyes toward the rear-view mirror, and I saw a vivid ghost. My face was pale as a piece of paper, and my eyes wide open. Inside my eyes, my sclera was full of tiny, little, red veins ready to explode at any second. I was going through one of the most difficult experiences of my life.\n\nThe entire road had plenty of cars and I was driving like a fool during rush-hours, the worst time for a new driver to go anywhere. I was quite nervous. From my perspective, the car lanes seemed like a big towering mountain on the horizon, one after the other. The yellow lights from the cars and the morning fog created a mist which I found hard to see through. My hands were attached to the wheel and rigid as an iron statue. I must have left fingers marks on the steering wheel from holding it so tight. I heard my boyfriend\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0092s voice telling me what to do, and when to change lane, as a loud noise pounded inside my head. Anything that I heard or saw was a hundred times bigger than normal. The paved road seemed enormous and narrow at the same time. For me, I imagined that I would crash with every big truck passing by. Sometimes, I slip over the right yellow line for a few seconds because I was afraid to have an accident.\n\nDriving on a busy turnpike freeway didn\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0092t exactly reduce my anxiety level. After 15 minutes or so, we had to stop for some diesel fuel. My boyfriend went inside to pay for the fuel, and I took a little 5 minute break from the stressful situation. I sat in the car evaluating how the next part of the trip would be. Meanwhile, that sweat-drenched tissue quickly became a soggy ball of paper mush. It was at that point that I considered taking a pill but I thought I better not because that could impair my driving. I had to overcome my fear of cars. I still hadn\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0092t managed to get accustomed to passing a car or accelerating. In two occasions, I pushed the break instead of the accelerator, and I did it with so much strength that we almost flew through the front glass.\n\nFinally, we arrived in Miami alive. I overcame my first fear of driving on the expressway. However, those 30 minutes were long and endless. But, after having thrown myself into driving, I confronted my fears directly. I\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0092m sure I won\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0092t be as nervous never again.",

        "text":"My Journey \u2013 Part\u00a01\n\nThis\u00a0multi-part serial captures the true adventures of a lad on the steam railway in the 1950s.\n\nThis was to be the most exciting \/nerve wracking day of my life. I had left home around about seven A.M on a Cumberland bus, and was impatiently waiting for the next leg of my trip. Having asked no less than half a dozen porters where I would get the train to Glasgow I was still apprehensive, had I been sent to the right platform, or were each of them having a laugh at a young boy obviously a first time traveller? The cold bit through my clothes but I didn\u2019t really feel it. A porter kept popping out of a door marked STAFF ONLY and repeatedly took out his watch looked at the dial and returned it to his waistcoat pocket, before looking across at me gently shaking his head before returning to the warmth of his office making sure the door was closed against the cold. Maybe the train wasn\u2019t coming?\n\nThen it all happened as if by magic, a loud speaker burst in on my thoughts, the garbled voice boomed over the platform, anyone who couldn\u2019t interpret the message would at least have heard the name Glasgow Central. The man who announced the train must have had special training to garble such an important statement. To be honest in all the time I served on the railway I never-ever understood any tannoy message, except the final couple of words such as I had just listened to.\n\nThe giant Locomotive hissing steam and smoke pulling masses of carriages clattered along the platform, two men leaning from the cab smiled through the coal dust as the drew up, their white teeth showing through the grime. I remember vividly the heat, the smell of hot oil as this colossus ground to a halt. It seemed to me that everyone on the station was aware that this was my first trip on a train.\n\nNot realising that the train would be here for a t least a few minutes I scrabbled at the door handle nearest me just as it opened almost breaking my fingers in the process. A man wearing a long coat and a trilby hat gave me a withering look; being me I withered him back and squeezed past him in case the train left without me. I heard a sniffle and a snort, something about \u2018kids\u2019. But the train would not leave without me; I was on board and looking for a seat.\n\nThis journey had begun some weeks earlier while still at school, I must have been eavesdropping on a conversation at Tom Fishers, our local barber. Both these men must have worked on the railway as something or another and suddenly I could see myself as a driver on a great steam engine. I was due to leave school in a few weeks and all of a sudden I knew what I was going to do.\n\nMy mother thought I was mad when I informed her of the news. \u201cDon\u2019t be so daft, your too scrawny for that job, big strong lads are what they are looking for.\u201d That was the wrong thing for Mam to say. She followed it up with \u201cWe will see what your Dad says when he gets home, where on earth did you get that idea?\u201d\n\nThat was just what it took! I was now absolutely convinced that this was exactly what I wanted.\n\nThe train whistle blew a sudden screech of steel on steel as the giant wheels bit into the steel rails, steam and smoke roared form the engine as it sought for traction. The couplings clattered and the great buffers groaned as the engine began to move the train away from the platform. My stomach lurched along with the buffers. \u201cThis is it\u201d I thought \u201cno going back\u201d.\n\nDid I do the right thing? I thought back to the day I had the audacity to knock on the Shed master\u2019s office door\u2026 For a moment there had been silence, then more of a bark than anything I could remember as a voice. \u201cCome in.\u201d That was all. \u00a0So, I did. I eased the large door open and peered around the edge. \u201cYes\u201d The word came from the mouth of a slim bony faced person who sat behind a rather large desk. \u201cCome in and close the door, what is it you want? can\u2019t you see I am busy?\u201d He did not look up from what he was doing. \u201dWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201c I have come to see if I can have a job?\u201d I managed to mutter.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d This was Mr. Darcy, this it turned out, was him in a good mood!\n\n\u201cWell I would like to be an engine driver \u201cI squeaked.\n\n\u201dWho in god\u2019s name told you, you could wander in here just as you please?\u201d was his next comment.\n\n\u201cI just thought as you were the boss you are the person I should see and as I was told go and see the Shed Master that is what I am doing.\u201d Oh the innocence of youth.\n\nI thought he was about to burst, his lips moved but for a moment nothing came out. I think he decided on a different tack and reached for the telephone that resided on one side of the desk. He barked once again to whoever it was on the other end of the line. \u201cGet in here now.\u201d\n\nA boy not much older than me came hurtling through the door. \u201cYes Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told this boy to come and see me? was it you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell take him up to the office and tell the manager to deal with it.\u201d\n\nI was taken by the arm and ushered out of the room double quick. \u201cHow did you manage to get in there?\u201d he questioned me as we got outside the building.\n\n\u201cI want a job and I was told to see the Shed master so that is what I did.\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cWell, you are supposed to see the clerk first, then the manager, all very official here, you should know that before there are any more problems.\u201d The rest of what he said was lost to me as he was talking fast and more to himself than to me.\n\n\u201cYou want to be an engine driver then?\u201d The office manager enquired, \u201cthere are, however, a few formalities we have to go through first, so we will begin with your name, age and address?\u201d\n\nAll the formalities over, all the forms filled in and I was informed that they whoever they were, would be in touch.\n\nI thought that was that and duly caught the bus home, Where I faced another barrage of questions, first from my mother, and later from dad. He was more understanding about these things and said not to worry he would talk to my mum, when she was in the proper mood.\n\nAbout a year later, at least that is what it seemed, but was probably no more than a week or so. A brown envelope arrived. It contained a short letter of instructions and a return ticket. Carlisle to Glasgow return it read. The instructions were as follows; You are to present yourself to Dr. Whoever at number whatever St George Square, Glasgow at 1 pm on whatever day etc.etc. For the purpose of a medical examination and eye test . Please present this letter to the Doctor on your arrival.\n\nSigned. Office Manager, \u00a0Kingmoor Motive Power Depot.\n\nSmoke filled the fields as the train roared through the countryside, the carriages lurched from side to side and the wheels kept up a constant tiddle e dum, tiddle e dum. The rhythm changing only as we crossed over points. Or as we hurtled through a station. Tiddle e Dum, tiddle e Dum. Onwards to Glasgow, the next part of my journey.\n\nTo be continued\u2026\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

If a big plant has a switching track of its own running through its property, cases have been known where a rebate has been collected by charging the railroads to which freight is delivered a considerable sum for each car handled over the private tracks.

The resentful sun sends its angelic armies: the Scourge. For now, they're being held back at Mercury by Penumbra.\nby Annie Stein\n\nWritten by skairunner\n\nA trio of blindingly bright fighters cut through a sunbeam. The mirror-clad Sunbreakers take the fight to the solar abominations, outnumbered but not outgunned, and beat back an incursion once more.\n\u00a0 The Sunbreaker SF-2 is a superiority craft built by Kallisti Aerospace specifically for defense of Mercury. It is a modification of a previous design, the venerable Sunderer SF-1 which was used heavily on and around Ganymede during the Cadamite Wars and exported all across the solar system afterwards. The Sunbreaker is intended as an all-purpose weapons platform that can operate for extended periods during Solar Pulses and the diurnal season, capable of air-space superiority, strike missions, and even close air support. There are two main variants, the single-seated SF-2a and the double-seat SF-2b with an expanded payload bay.\n\n\nNow is the worst part of takeoff: the gap between when Eun gets her wings and when she\u2019s allowed to fly. The hum of her craft seems to collect inside her as impatience.\n\u00a0 Although the chassis of the Sunbreaker is nearly identical to that of its predecessor, nearly every other part of the craft has been updated or upgraded for use in the unique Mercury environment. \u00a0 Similarly to the Sunderer, the Sunbreaker uses two swivel-mounted engines mounted towards the rear. The twin Kurundam engines provide omnidirectional thrust and allow the craft to vertically take off, hover, and cruise both in and out of atmosphere. The Sunbreaker can also hover or fly in reverse, but most pilots tend not to use this capability due to the added difficulty of the maneuver. Loss of one engine massively degrades maneuverability and top speed but allows the damaged craft to return to base. \u00a0 Sunbreakers are designed to operate both in and out of atmosphere, so its cockpit is sealed and has oxygen generation systems, and pilots are expected to wear atmosphere suits. Kurundam engines are often used for small spacecraft as well, and the craft does not depend on wing-generated lift for flight. The cockpit is equipped with windows with adaptive dimmers, but direct visual contact is unused in most combat situations in favor of electronic systems and heads-up displays. \u00a0 The eject system includes a canopy disconnect and a rocket-equipped chair that also uses retrorockets to cut velocity before impact. Finally, a reflective composite blanket with a transponder is stowed in the chair. Survival times when ejecting in the dinural phase is up to thirty minutes, while nocturnal phase survival times are relatively long thanks to an also-included chemical heat generator.\n\nMirrored Plating\n\nSure, it looks like a million compact mirrors glued onto a Sunderer, but this bird can fight. I swear, the sundogs take damage just from seeing their ugly mugs reflected back at them.\n\u00a0 The most striking feature of the Sunbreaker is its mirrored armor plating, which drastically reduces the amount of energy required to cool the craft. Most of the armor is reactive, breaking away to absorb impacts. Advanced sensors are hidden beneath certain sections of the armor, hardened against heat and light and providing pilots with tactical awareness. \u00a0 When parked in a hangar, a Sunbreaker's armor plates have noticeable gaps between them. This is because each plate is expected to expand in the intense heat of the sun. Additionally, the gaps facilitate access to the joins that attach each plate to the frame, allowing plates to be easily replaced when required. A downside is that Sunbreaker armor is substantially less effective in the nocturnal side of Mercury, but this is considered an acceptable cost to pay as few enemies are found in the shade. \u00a0\nEun swears she can hear her Sunbreaker creak and groan as if stretching after a long nap, the hexagonal mirror panels rapidly warming and expanding to fit each other snugly. The deck crew always tell her she\u2019s imagining it. She pulls up the armor integrity screen with an easy twist of a selector dial, making sure each section goes from grey to green.\n\n\nTwo weapons pylons on each side of the frame utilize universal weapon stations to allow switching loadouts depending on the mission, and a payload bay can carry missiles, bombs, or extended sensor equipment. \u00a0 One weapon station on the nose of the craft is intended for mounting a forward-facing weapon, usually a simple slug thrower as a weapon of last resort.\n\n\nAfter the initial wave of Solar Pulses were weathered and Project Ikarus was concieved, Penumbra started procurement for superiority craft. Kallisti Aerospace's bid was accepted primarily due to the fact that there was an extensive base of Sunderer pilots that could pilot a Sunbreaker without retraining, as well as the relatively low costs of the platform. The fact that the craft was delivered on time and within budget shows that it was the correct choice at least in that regard. \u00a0 Penumbra only maintains a small fleet of Sunbreakers on Mercury, approximately enough units for its pilots to fly. Extra Sunbreakers are delivered to orbital hangars around Venus and couriered when required, reducing the amount of mobile storage that must be maintained in the difficult Mercury environment. The craft are usually stored ready to be deployed save for munitions, which are stored separately when not in use for safety reasons. \u00a0 Upon return, a series of tasks must be completed to ensure that a Sunbreaker is ready for its next deployment. Any remaining munitions are removed and stored. Next, armor plates that have been damaged must be uninstalled and replaced. Because Sunbreaker armor is reactive, even light damage usually requires a full replacement for optimal protection. Finally, system checks must be run. While simple defects can be fixed with on-planet facilities, more serious problems will require craft to be shipped off-world for repairs, usually to Venus. The most damaged craft may instead be salvaged for spare parts or materials and the remainder discarded, if the hangar crew determine that it will not be worth the time and money spent to refurbish the vehicle.\nMilitary Formation Usage\nCurrent location\nComplement \/ Crew\nCargo & Passenger Capacity\nTable of Contents\nThis article is a stub .

It just screams 'Military Aircraft\" and oozes attention to fine details that only accentuate the feel of the article. I made my own military aircraft article during WE2021, and I attempted to push in a fair amoun of detail in that article, so I'm happy to see that others care enough about this sort of topic to make such excellent content! \u00a0 Overall, marvelous work on a marvelous war machine, and if all your vehicle articles end up being this good, then I can barely wait to see them in their glory!\n\n12 Mar, 2022 19:17\n\nThank you! I am also in love with the Sunbreaker and I'm glad that you like it too\n\nEternal Sage Am\u00e9lieIS\nAm\u00e9lie I. S. Debruyne\n12 Mar, 2022 17:07\n\nI love the amount of details that you have and how you explain the purpose of everything :D I'm not a big reader of SF, but I felt that you gave your technology a unique flavour. \u00a0 Only thing I feel would be nice to add later is a sketch of the rough shape of the aircraft because I'm absolutely terrible at visualising anything XD\n\nTo see what I am up to:WE pledge and article list.\n12 Mar, 2022 19:18\n\nI was also trying to make a drawing of it but concept arting is hard so progress is quite slow :'(\n\n20 Mar, 2022 21:22\n\nThe mechanical engineer in me loves this article. You have included just enough details to give an idea of the craft and how it operates, showing the thought put into the details, without bogging it down with unnecessary facts. It leaves me wanting to read more about them, specifically in the future prose I can't wait to see written! \u00a0 The quotes from the short story you wrote already accent everything nicely, as well. Very well done.\n\nLead Author of Vazdimet.\nNecromancy is a Wholesome Science.\n24 Mar, 2022 15:36\n\nThank you! I enjoyed writing about the details quite a bit and I am glad it is appreciated! I think nnie's the one who inserted the quotes from the story so that's who that credit should go towards :D",
