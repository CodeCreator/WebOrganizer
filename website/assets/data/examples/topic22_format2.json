        "text":"Steve Poleskie with his first airplane, a Champion Citabria 7ECA, 1972\n\n\nTeaching Myself to Fly an Airplane\n\n\nby Stephen Poleskie\n\nWhen I mentioned that I was writing an article about teaching myself to fly, my friend asked: \u201cWho do you think you are, Leonardo da Vinci?\u201d So I know a clever person, who must have read Leonardo\u2019s notebooks. In case you haven\u2019t read these texts, when he wasn\u2019t working on paintings, murals, or designing war machines, Leonard often made drawings for devices to get himself into the sky. Most of these involved jumping from a castle tower into the moat below. Thus, some people credit da Vinci with inventing the parachute.\n\nI explained to my young friend that the flying article was actually more about my being an autodidact, a word he surprisingly was not familiar with. I suppose that in this day and age, when one is encouraged to stay in school until you can\u2019t borrow any more money, a \u201cself-taught person\u201d is a bit of an anomaly. I take pride in having taught myself everything that was important to me, including screen printing, which I learned by reading a pamphlet given out free by a Sherwin Williams paint store in Pennsylvania and then taught at Cornell University for 33 years.\n\nMy flying story begins in a deer stand. When I moved up to Ithaca from New York City, I can\u2019t say that I wasn\u2019t bored. I did miss my evenings at Max\u2019s, gallery openings, and the rest of the NYC art world milieu. In my free time I began doing the things that people did in the fall in upstate New York. One of these activities was deer hunting.\n\nI won\u2019t elaborate how I got into a deer stand, crouched waiting for my friends to flush out a buck to come running from the neighboring fields for me to shoot. However, I will say that I was uncomfortable; cold, cramped and bored. And then I heard a familiar sound. I looked up and saw a small airplane passing overhead. This was it \u2014 that is where I should be; up there in the clear blue sky. I loved airplanes, having flown models in my youth, and even taken a few flying lessons. I jumped out of my hiding place, ran for my truck and drove to the local airport.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s December,\u201d Mr. H, the chief flight instructor and owner of the flying school reminded me. \u201cNo one learns to fly in the winter, the weather\u2019s too bad. Come back in the spring.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I want to start right now,\u201d I insisted, full of enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cOkay, come back on the next nice day, in the meantime buy this book,\u201d Mr. H snarled, sliding a tome across his desk, \u201cand learn everything in it before you come around again. You will notice that my name is mentioned in the acknowledgements.\u201d Alas, I had met a man who had a bigger ego than mine.\n\nMy lessons went well. I was working with a flight instructor named Rogie. I could take off and land and in a short time was allowed to do this all by myself; flying solo it\u2019s called. The problem came when I asked Rogie to teach me how to do spins. Spins were no longer in the curriculum, Rogie explained. It seems that too many pilots had crashed practicing spins, so the FAA had decided pilots no longer needed to know spin recovery techniques. The theory was that if you never got into a spin you would not need to know how to get out of one. But if someone accidentally got into a spin and didn\u2019t know how to recover, well that was just too bad. I convinced Rogie to demonstrate a spin and recovery, which he did. I can still recall the terror on his face as we rotated one turn, which was all he would do.\n\nBut I was hooked. I loved the experience. I had grown tired of practicing takeoffs and landings and turns about a point. Whenever I was sent off solo I would go out to the practice area and climb to a safe altitude, and then spin the airplane to my heart\u2019s content.\n\nAs part of the curriculum, I had to take a check ride with the chief flight instructor, the owner, Mr. H. When we were taxiing out I noticed that the artificial horizon was malfunctioning. This is an instrument one used to keep the wings level when flying blind, that is in fog or clouds without ground reference.\n\nWe got to the end of the taxiway and I did a run up, checking the engine gauges and magnetos prior to take off. Then Mr. H told me to taxi back to the hangar. I had failed the check ride, he informed me, because I had taxied out with an inoperable artificial horizon.\n\nI argued that as it was a perfectly clear day we would have no need for the artificial horizon. Then I revealed what would be my downfall. I explained that whenever I spun the airplane the artificial horizon tumbled, but always came back. I didn\u2019t know at the time that aerobatic airplanes had non-tumbling instruments, and this Piper was not an aerobatic airplane.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the one who has been spinning my airplanes!\u201d Mr. H screeched, adding, \u201cYou are out of my flying school. You are a menace to yourself and everyone around you. You have no business being in an airplane.\u201d\n\nKicked out; so what was I to do? The only other flying school on the field was a flying club, and I was not a joiner. I had enough of meetings back at my college department. If no one would teach me how to fly I would teach myself. But to do that I would need to have an airplane, and the two flying schools were the only ones on this field who rented aircraft. I decided that I would have to buy an airplane.\n\nI found it in a hangar at an airport in Pennsylvania, a Champion Citabria 7ECA. This was a real aerobatic airplane, if only a beginner\u2019s model, and it was used, which put it in my price range. I took a demonstration ride, and we did a few loops, rolls and spins. I would be back next week with the money. As the Citabria was based on an older design and had its third wheel on the rear, I would also need to be checked out for flying a tail wheel aircraft.\n\nHow I accomplished this frenzied project I cannot recall. But I do remember visits to my bank manager, and taking time with a local free-lance flight instructor who owned a tail wheel airplane. I got a friend to fly me down to Pennsylvania. I would be flying home in my own aerobatic airplane.\n\nThe transaction was complete. The local flight instructor, who had demonstrated the Citabria to me, checked me out in the airplane. After a few take offs and landings, at the small grass field wedged between a mountain and a river, the instructor got out. He shook my hand and wished me a good flight home. I told him I needed one more thing, a log book endorsement for the cross-country flight. You see student pilots, which I still was, couldn\u2019t go flying off anywhere without an endorsement from their flight instructor. I remember the concerned look on the man\u2019s face. He was reluctant to sign my log book because of my limited experience. Then he must have remembered the commission on the sale he would lose if I backed out of the deal. He signed.\n\nI taxied out and took off. The landing would be no problem I thought, since the airport that I was headed for was a mile long and paved. As the Citabria climbed out I reached into the door pocket for a chart. To my surprise there was none there. The flying school airplanes always had charts in the door pocket, but this was my airplane and neither I nor the previous owner had supplied one. I turned back, but the runway at the airport I had just departed looked so short. I decided to head for home. I knew the way without a chart, I had driven it: follow the river to Binghamton and then head northwest until I see Lake Cayuga. The airport is on the East side of the lake.\n\nSuccessfully arrived in Ithaca, I parked my Citabria on the ramp and went inside the Fixed Base Office to arrange for fuel and hangar space. Mr. H was inside looking out the window. Spying me he gestured for me to come over. He pointed to the strange Citabria on the ramp. \u201cNow there\u2019s a real airplane,\u201d he said, \u201cIf you ever learn how to fly, and get good enough, some day you might be able to fly something like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my airplane,\u201d I revealed. \u201cI just bought it in Pennsylvania and flew it here.\u201d\n\nMr. H glared at me, an expression of disbelief on his face. \u201cI suggest you return that airplane to whoever you bought it from and get your money back before you kill yourself in it, \u201c he said, turning and walking away.\n\nI didn\u2019t take his advice.\n\n\n\nAbout the author:\n\nStephen Poleskie\u2019s writing has appeared in journals in Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, the Philippines, and the\u00a0UK, as well as in the USA, and in three anthologies, including The Book of Love, (W.W.

        "text":"Sunbreaker SF-2\n\nby Annie Stein\nWelcome to Solaris, traveller! Let me get you up to speed.\nSolaris is a soft science fiction webcomic set in our own universe, kind of. Learn more by continuing to read, or click here to be taken to the comic.\nQ:Where am I? \u00a0 You're still in the system known as Sol. Except this time each planet is habitable and developed its own life. The people are humanoid, mostly.\nQ:I heard something about a comic? \u00a0 Oh yes! The main comic is still in development, but you can read the first few pages of the Expanse if you click here. \u00a0\nQ:What's going on? \u00a0 Sol is invading. The resentful sun sends its angelic armies: the Scourge. For now, they're being held back at Mercury by Penumbra.\nby Annie Stein\n\nWritten by skairunner\n\nA trio of blindingly bright fighters cut through a sunbeam. The mirror-clad Sunbreakers take the fight to the solar abominations, outnumbered but not outgunned, and beat back an incursion once more.\n\u00a0 The Sunbreaker SF-2 is a superiority craft built by Kallisti Aerospace specifically for defense of Mercury. It is a modification of a previous design, the venerable Sunderer SF-1 which was used heavily on and around Ganymede during the Cadamite Wars and exported all across the solar system afterwards. The Sunbreaker is intended as an all-purpose weapons platform that can operate for extended periods during Solar Pulses and the diurnal season, capable of air-space superiority, strike missions, and even close air support. There are two main variants, the single-seated SF-2a and the double-seat SF-2b with an expanded payload bay.\n\n\nNow is the worst part of takeoff: the gap between when Eun gets her wings and when she\u2019s allowed to fly. The hum of her craft seems to collect inside her as impatience.\n\u00a0 Although the chassis of the Sunbreaker is nearly identical to that of its predecessor, nearly every other part of the craft has been updated or upgraded for use in the unique Mercury environment. \u00a0 Similarly to the Sunderer, the Sunbreaker uses two swivel-mounted engines mounted towards the rear. The twin Kurundam engines provide omnidirectional thrust and allow the craft to vertically take off, hover, and cruise both in and out of atmosphere. The Sunbreaker can also hover or fly in reverse, but most pilots tend not to use this capability due to the added difficulty of the maneuver. Loss of one engine massively degrades maneuverability and top speed but allows the damaged craft to return to base. \u00a0 Sunbreakers are designed to operate both in and out of atmosphere, so its cockpit is sealed and has oxygen generation systems, and pilots are expected to wear atmosphere suits. Kurundam engines are often used for small spacecraft as well, and the craft does not depend on wing-generated lift for flight. The cockpit is equipped with windows with adaptive dimmers, but direct visual contact is unused in most combat situations in favor of electronic systems and heads-up displays. \u00a0 The eject system includes a canopy disconnect and a rocket-equipped chair that also uses retrorockets to cut velocity before impact. Finally, a reflective composite blanket with a transponder is stowed in the chair. Survival times when ejecting in the dinural phase is up to thirty minutes, while nocturnal phase survival times are relatively long thanks to an also-included chemical heat generator.\n\nMirrored Plating\n\nSure, it looks like a million compact mirrors glued onto a Sunderer, but this bird can fight. I swear, the sundogs take damage just from seeing their ugly mugs reflected back at them.\n\u00a0 The most striking feature of the Sunbreaker is its mirrored armor plating, which drastically reduces the amount of energy required to cool the craft. Most of the armor is reactive, breaking away to absorb impacts. Advanced sensors are hidden beneath certain sections of the armor, hardened against heat and light and providing pilots with tactical awareness. \u00a0 When parked in a hangar, a Sunbreaker's armor plates have noticeable gaps between them. This is because each plate is expected to expand in the intense heat of the sun. Additionally, the gaps facilitate access to the joins that attach each plate to the frame, allowing plates to be easily replaced when required. A downside is that Sunbreaker armor is substantially less effective in the nocturnal side of Mercury, but this is considered an acceptable cost to pay as few enemies are found in the shade. \u00a0\nEun swears she can hear her Sunbreaker creak and groan as if stretching after a long nap, the hexagonal mirror panels rapidly warming and expanding to fit each other snugly. The deck crew always tell her she\u2019s imagining it. She pulls up the armor integrity screen with an easy twist of a selector dial, making sure each section goes from grey to green.\n\n\nTwo weapons pylons on each side of the frame utilize universal weapon stations to allow switching loadouts depending on the mission, and a payload bay can carry missiles, bombs, or extended sensor equipment. \u00a0 One weapon station on the nose of the craft is intended for mounting a forward-facing weapon, usually a simple slug thrower as a weapon of last resort.\n\n\nAfter the initial wave of Solar Pulses were weathered and Project Ikarus was concieved, Penumbra started procurement for superiority craft. Kallisti Aerospace's bid was accepted primarily due to the fact that there was an extensive base of Sunderer pilots that could pilot a Sunbreaker without retraining, as well as the relatively low costs of the platform. The fact that the craft was delivered on time and within budget shows that it was the correct choice at least in that regard. \u00a0 Penumbra only maintains a small fleet of Sunbreakers on Mercury, approximately enough units for its pilots to fly. Extra Sunbreakers are delivered to orbital hangars around Venus and couriered when required, reducing the amount of mobile storage that must be maintained in the difficult Mercury environment. The craft are usually stored ready to be deployed save for munitions, which are stored separately when not in use for safety reasons. \u00a0 Upon return, a series of tasks must be completed to ensure that a Sunbreaker is ready for its next deployment. Any remaining munitions are removed and stored. Next, armor plates that have been damaged must be uninstalled and replaced. Because Sunbreaker armor is reactive, even light damage usually requires a full replacement for optimal protection. Finally, system checks must be run. While simple defects can be fixed with on-planet facilities, more serious problems will require craft to be shipped off-world for repairs, usually to Venus. The most damaged craft may instead be salvaged for spare parts or materials and the remainder discarded, if the hangar crew determine that it will not be worth the time and money spent to refurbish the vehicle.\nMilitary Formation Usage\nCurrent location\nComplement \/ Crew\nCargo & Passenger Capacity\nTable of Contents\nThis article is a stub .

And they belonged to people not only in City Hall, but also in Sacramento. What the heck was going on here? This was just a friggin' parking lot. There couldn't be the amount of money involved to interest folks at that altitude. Or could there?\n\n\nI figured it was time to get some more information from Betty. She had been in the parking business for 30 years. If anyone knew about parking, it was Betty. When my wife and assistant Shirley returned from making the phone call, she had a funny look on her face.\n\n\n\"Betty wasn't too forthcoming. She sounded frightened. She told me she was very busy and couldn't afford the time to talk to us. I think someone got to her. She did say, however, that perhaps we might want to talk to Marilyn North. She is an auditor and a former parking operator who works out of Seattle. Betty did give me her number. When I called, I found that she was actually here in L.A. working on a job. She'll be here in an hour.\"\n\n\n\"Wow,\" I said. \"That's a lot in just two phone calls. We have to be careful. We don't want it to look like we are 'investigating' anything. This has to be just a social call. It might be better if we met her at Paulo's. The office may be under some kind of surveillance.\"\n\n\n\"Right, I'll call her back.\"\n\n\nI thought it best if only Paulo and I met with North. That way, only our licenses were in jeopardy. Our major operative, Jim Walsh, was planning to continue to follow up with his contacts in the LAPD. I told him to go home and await developments. No need for all of us to be at risk of permanent unemployment. Shirley stayed to cover the phones, and discretion being the, well, you know, I decided I would drive. After the run down the hill to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center a couple of days ago with Paulo, I didn't want to take any chances.\n\n\nPaul Junior lived in a small house on a canal in Venice. Yes, there really are canals in Venice, California. In 1904, a developer named Abbot Kinney actually built a representation of Venice, Italy, on the Southern California coast just south of Santa Monica -- complete with canals, bridges and all the trimmings. Some of the canals were filled in about 1929, but a several remain, and small \"California bungalows\" line the waterways.\n\n\nSome bungalows are original 1920s; others have been gentrified to multimillion-dollar mansions, with designs ranging from a Hansel and Gretel \"witch's house\" to chrome, glass and steel. One might wonder how Paulo could afford such a place. It was left to him by my aunt when she passed away a few years ago. It was of the original design, and he kept all the wonderful feel of the '20s.\n\n\nMarilyn North arrived just behind us. She was 50ish, stocky, and in control. She stuck out her had and introduced herself. \"Marilyn North. You must be Paul Manning; who's the kid?\" I introduced my son.\n\n\n\"So,\" she asked, \"what do you want to know?\"\n\n\nWe sat on Paulo's front porch overlooking the canal. I told her the story and where we were, which was basically nowhere.\n\n\n\"Well, most people don't understand that parking generates a huge amount of money,\" North said. \"We are talking billions, maybe as many as 20 billion, nationwide. A single location could take in between half a million and a million dollars or more each year. There is room for temptation to step in, plus a lot of room for error. Most parking operators try to do a good job, but the owners drive down the fees they get so much that it's difficult to perform. You know that the manager of a McDonald's makes six figures, while a parking manager of a location grossing the same amount might make 50K on a good day.\n\n\n\"The other problem is taxes. With so much money floating around, folks want to keep as much as they can,\" North said. \"So they don't report all the income, and thus don't pay the 10% tax. This has two advantages: the obvious one of taking home more, but the other is more subtle. If legitimate operators pay their taxes and an illegitimate one like your buddy William Francis Smith doesn't, he has a 10% advantage when he bids a job. He can bid it at 10% less and still make the same amount of profit. And we are talking about a lot of money here. On one of those million-dollar locations, that's a hundred grand right on the bottom line.\"\n\n\n\"But,\" I asked, \"how can they put so much pressure on the government that my license has been pulled?\"\n\n\n\"Well, when you have that much cash, you can spread it around downtown and at the state capital. Smith has his tentacles into a lot of pies, not just parking. It's to his advantage to support the right council members and state legislators. My guess is that with two phone calls, he cut you off at the knees.\"\n\n\n\"Any idea where we should go from here?\"\n\n\n\"I'm auditing one of Smith's locations right now. I'm working for the owner who got suspicious. It's a real mess. The skimming is in six figures, maybe more. Perhaps I can put some pressure on Smith and he might make a mistake.\"\n\n\n\"What do you think the guys were doing on the roof of that garage when they were spotted by Grace Lundquist?\"\n\n\n\"They were the bagmen for LaFlonza, Smith and his cronies at City Hall. Those sacks being exchanged were filled with cash. My guess is that the garage was a convenient location and they thought they were safe - they just never looked up. They probably have moved the drop to somewhere else by now.\"\n\n\nAs we sat there considering what had been said, a blond woman in her late 50s walked up. She was shadowed by two gorillas. She looked very familiar. When she spoke, her accent -- like that of a she-wolf from the slopes of Mt. Etna, but soft, like the moonlight on the Spanish steps -- was unmistakable.\n\n\n\"We meet again, Mr. Manning. Your son is a handsome young man, but too young for me now. But I digress. No, remain seated, this will take only a minute. You have a choice. Stop what you are doing immediately or you will certainly lose your business, and maybe your lives. I know where you and your beautiful wife live, I know where your son lives, and you know I can deliver on what I say.\" Maria LaFlonza walked away.\n\n\nNorth looked at me and cracked a cold smile. \"You sure know how to stir up trouble, don't you, Manning.\"\n\n\n\n\nParking Today Subscribe BANNER",

What is already done is declared by Commissioner of Corporations Herbert Knox Smith, to be \u201cthe best example in the country of a practical co\u00f6rdination of rail, industrial and water business, for the benefit of the entire community.\u201d\n\nNew Orleans lies in a loop of the Father of Waters, backing up on Lake Pontchartrain. The great river furnishes a highway from the North for all the products of the Mississippi valley. Alongside the river also run great railroads, leading down from Chicago and the North.\n\nThough located a hundred miles from the Gulf of Mexico, tl\u0131e giant jetties built years ago by Captain Eads so confine the river that its resistless waters keep constantly scoured clean a deep channel, giving easy access for ocean going vessels. At the docks in New Orleans steamers from St. Paul, two thousand miles inland, and rusty cargo boats from Liverpool and Italy may rub noses together.\n\nThat these docks may be kept free of burdensome charges, that the gateway to\n\ntraffic may not be forced to pay a tribute to a private purse, more than seven miles of the river frontage are publicly owned and managed.\n\nNearly thirty great wharves have been built at public expense, fitted with huge steel warehouses for the storage of goods and\n\nwith modern machinery for the quick handling of grain, fruit, coal and other products.\n\nBut the people of New Orleans have not been content with securing permanent public control of their water front. Equally important with water transportation\u2014more important to local industries \u2014is transportation by rail. And just as railways by favoring one city or one section of a state, as opposed to others, have shown their power to divert and concentrate business prosperity, so have they the power to foster the growth of one section of a city\u2014of one group of industries\u2014at the expense of others. If a big plant has a switching track of its own running through its property, cases have been known where a rebate has been collected by charging the railroads to which freight is delivered a considerable sum for each car handled over the private tracks. And where loaded cars must be switched from the tracks of one road to another before getting started toward their destination there are always likely to be delays and other annoyances.\n\n[graphic][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][ocr errors][subsumed][ocr errors][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][ocr errors][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][ocr errors][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][ocr errors][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][ocr errors][subsumed][subsumed][subsumed][ocr errors][subsumed][subsumed][ocr errors]...
