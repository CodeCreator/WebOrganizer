        "text":"A Poetry Reading @ Poetry\u00a0Express\n\n\nThe restaurant was quiet and church-like. The wait staff and cooks outnumbered the guests. I walked towards the back and found a banquet room where a half dozen people sat quietly eating. They sat at one of the two long banquet tables in a kind of solemn thanksgiving.\n\nThe woman hosting who\u2019d emailed me sometime earlier, approached and introduced herself. I sat down and waited for the program to start. The man next to me whom I\u2019d known for years, took out a folder and removed a painting of his mother whom earlier this year had died. The painting was of her as a younger woman and he told me that she\u2019d been a professional opera singer in her youth. When he caught me writing out some brief notes, he announced aloud I was left handed. I remembered the story my mom told me that when I was a baby and she was letting me try to feed myself, she would take the food or utensil out of my left hand and put it in my right and she said I would just throw it down and not eat anything in frustration. He in turn talked about how in even older days left-handedness was discouraged and many youngsters were forcibly made to use their right. Once I sat in a college lecture and the desk in the auditorium was so tiny and so obviously intended for a right hander\u2019s comfort, I gave up and used the writing tablet of the desk next to me to keep notes. Then someone behind me stage whispering to someone else to \u2018look\u2019\u2026\n\nThe room was intimate enough to where there was no need for a open mic sheet. Anyone could just stand and do their reading for up to five minutes. After 20 minutes of open, I was given the floor. It was nice having a couple of people I knew, one a wonderful poet and the other a former co-worker whom I ran into on Bart the previous week, walk in and join the proceedings. I laid my phone down on the table next to me and recorded it. It was a wonderful, fun and positive reading of new poems. The recording came out nicely.\n\nFeel Free to Listen on Soundcloud\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

While he expects us to keep these commandments perfectly, \u00a0He knows we can\u2019t so He sent his son Jesus to die on the cross for us. \u00a0This is the foundation for teaching my kids right from wrong.\n\nA while ago I wrote a post on lying. \u00a0Why do they lie?\u00a0 Why do our kids do the things they do? \u00a0We have many issues with Isaiah. \u00a0As I started this post, I had pause to do a time out with him for stealing his brother\u2019s blue tooth. \u00a0And his chocolate Easter Bunny front he freezer. \u00a0And for food under his bed. \u00a0(it is bed room cleaning day!) \u00a0 Isaiah is five, he entered our family at 3 months. \u00a0So he has been raised by us, same morals and values. \u00a0Same rules. \u00a0I keep teaching him right from wrong.\n\nOne of our foster boys I made up a little reminder sheet for him. \u00a0He had sticky pockets. \u00a0AKA as always taking things with him that were not his. \u00a0He did this a lot from his class room. \u00a0He would take things from other kids backpacks. \u00a0He could walk by something and just take it.\n\nThe reminder sheet simple said:\n\nIs it yours? \u00a0Yes, then you may have it. \u00a0No, leave it be.\n\nI think one of the best ways to teach kids right from wrong is to discuss it daily. \u00a0Talk about why what they did was wrong, not that it was just wrong. \u00a0Keep the communication open. \u00a0Discuss the 10 commandment. \u00a0Martin Luther\u2019s Catechism is great to review the 10 commandments and their meanings. \u00a0There are many great ways to memorize the 10 commandments.\n\n\u00a0teaching kids right from wrongHaving Family Rules also help. \u00a0This gives them guide lines to so they know what is right and what is wrong. \u00a0 We have rules, but they have become unwritten down again. \u00a0Again a May project we are working on to update them. \u00a0 \u00a0I think rules should not be should nots.\n\nYou should not hit. \u00a0Instead say,\n\nIn this family\/house we respect each other. \u00a0Which means we do not hit, kick, bite, smack, pull hair, spit, punch or hurt any one. \u00a0Including the pets.\n\nThis way is also better for new foster kids coming in.

        "text":"Feng Shui For Your Kitchen!\n\nkitchen decor\n\n(planete deco)\n\nIn the last two months I\u2019ve had a crash course in kitchen design\u2026 from cabinet components to plumbing, color to countertops. \u00a0I have a real reverance for kichens now, even more than ever, as I understand the many layers of intricacy in even a simple, budget-friendly design (that will still be well over 8,000!). \u00a0When your kitchen is bubbling with energy and life force you\u2019ll enjoy the benefits of kitchens- cooking, synergy in the family, wellness, propagating life, storing nutrition- on an even higher level.\n\nThis week, the kitchen feng shui tips are designed to nourish your life!\u00a0\n\nkitchen decor (via)\n\nFeng Shui For Your Kitchen by Carol M Olmstead, Feng Shui For Real Life\n\nA clean, bright, and clutter-free kitchen is a symbol of good health and prosperity in Feng Shui. The kitchen represents the heart of the house because that\u2019s where you prepare the food that nourishes and sustains life. Here are a few things you can do to create a Feng Shui kitchen in any home, no matter how large or small.\n\nbar cart herbs\n\n(emily henderson)\n\nChoose the Right Colors. Use bright, sunny, and earthy colors like yellow, terracotta, and brown to feel stable and grounded in your kitchen. Use the color red sparingly in a kitchen, because your stove, microwave, and other appliances generate enough of the Fire Element.\n\nTake Care of Your Stove. A stove is associated with wealth so it\u2019s important to keep all of your cooking surfaces clean and in good working order. Immediately fix any nonworking burners, and if you have a favorite burner, consider using a different one occasionally to symbolize that you are taking full advantage of all of your financial resources. Hang a mirror behind your stove or display a shiny teakettle to symbolically double the number of burners and double your wealth.\n\nControl Water. Water symbolizes the flow of wealth, so a leaking faucet means money \u201cgoing down the drain.\u201d Fix your leaks and you will stop the drain on your finances. If your sink and stove are located across from each other it also represents a financial drain. Place a small, nickel size mirror on the stove to reflect away the water, or place a green rug on the floor between them.\n\n\n\nDisplay Fresh Flowers and Fruit. Display fresh flowers, healthy plants, or bowls of fruit in your kitchen to represent vitality. The classic Feng Shui recommendation is a bowl of 9 oranges. Plants like lucky bamboo help clean and purify the air, so place them in the corners of a dark kitchen, between the sink and the stove, and on top of the refrigerator.\n\nLight Your Kitchen. If you don\u2019t have a lot of natural lighting, brighten up your kitchen with pendants, chandeliers, recessed lights, track lighting, or under-cabinet lighting. It\u2019s best to avoid fluorescent lighting because it represents harsh, cutting energy. You can also hang a mirror across from the window to attract more light into a small kitchen.\n\nSeparate Food and Cleaning Supplies. Avoid storing your brooms, mops, and cleaning supplies out in the open or near your food, because this represents symbolically \u201csweeping away\u201d and cleaning out your good health. It\u2019s okay to keep your trash under the sink, just be sure to use the smallest size container you can live with and empty it frequently. Never keep the cat\u2019s litter box in the kitchen.\n\nRemove Clutter and Other Negative Chi. Try to keep your kitchen as clutter free as possible so positive chi can flow through your space. That means keeping your counters free from objects like newspapers, mail, and schoolwork, and limiting the number of knick-knacks you display. Update any old photos, take-out menus, or shopping lists on the fridge door. Replace the scorched oven mitts. To symbolically remove negative energy, sweep your kitchen floor toward the door rather than into the room. And, don\u2019t forget to throw out everything in your refrigerator and pantry that\u2019s stale, expired, or \u201cfuzzy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nfeng shui 101And, if you want to dive in to your own personalized feng shui in a modern, practical way, Say hello to Feng Shui 101. \u00a0Its the guide I made for you to create your own personalized feng shui at home, in the office, wherever you may be\u2026 in 8 weeks. \u00a0It\u2019s not filled with strict rules or what you \u201cmust\u201d do. \u00a0Its filled with information, questions, exercises and even videos and classes to help you confidently create amazing spaces with killer feng shui and live with more flow. \u00a0 Learn more about the 8-week feng shui adventure & grab your copy to get started right HERE\u2026 \u00a0And, as always,\u00a0please let me know what happens!\n\ndana June 12, 2015 at 3:10 pm\n\nI love this so much I pinned it twice!

        "text":"7 Challenge, Everyday Life\n\nWaste Not: Part 5 of the 7 Challenge\n\n7: An Experimental Mutiny Against ExcessLast month I was supposed to be working on the Waste part of the 7 challenge. When I began thinking about this part of the challenge, I thought I was already doing pretty well on that front. I have a family of four and we fill up our recycling cart at the same rate if not faster than our trash cart. Usually, our trash cart is only half full on the day the trash is picked up. I am guilty of looking at neighbors\u2019 trash cans on trash pick up day and thinking, \u201cWow. They are Wasters.\u201d Needless to say, there was a high horse to fall off there.\n\nAnd fall off I did. Because, while I do recycle absolutely everything I possibly can, the point remains that if I have something to recycle, that means I\u2019m buying something that\u2019s prepackaged. Deli meats, canned spaghetti sauce, boxes of noodles, yogurt cups, all that stuff comes in recyclable packages. And some things I consider to be necessary are packaged and aren\u2019t recyclable. I mean, when I think about all the Styrofoam egg cartons\u2026but how do you get around that? Aldi only sells one kind of egg!\n\nI guess it all comes down to how much trouble I\u2019m willing to go to in my attempts to reduce waste. I think I kind of phoned it in on this part of the challenge. And that is unacceptable. So I\u2019m doing a re-do in March. Here are the more specific goals for the month:\n\n-Start (and, please Lord, finish!) potty training Isaac in the second half of the month. He\u2019ll be 3 in June and with another baby due in July, now seems like it\u2019s time. My \u201cmethod\u201d relies heavily on not wearing a whole lot of clothing for the first few days of potty training, which is why I think this should take place in the warmer part of \u00a0the month. I greet this part of the challenge with a great deal of trepidation\u2013potty training my firstborn took about a year, and I am not exaggerating.\n\n-At least\u00a0try\u00a0to get Ella out of nighttime Pull-ups. I\u2019ve heard some parents have success with waking young children up and taking them to the bathroom before the parents go to bed. I\u2019m just not sure about this one. One problem is I go to bed about an hour to an hour and a half after my children. Is that enough time? Another problem is I abhor the drama that always follows when my poor little four-year-old is incoherently sleepy. To willingly bring that upon both of us is going to take some girding up of mental toughness. If anyone else has experience with methods for getting rid of Pull-ups at night, please share. I\u2019d really prefer not waking her up because I think she barely gets enough sleep as it is.\n\n-Sew a couple of handkerchiefs for myself. Yes, I just used the word \u201chandkerchief.\u201d And the word \u201csew.\u201d I hate, hate,\u00a0hate\u00a0buying Kleenexes. Which is why my husband is always asking in a very nice but what I hear as accusing tone, \u201cDon\u2019t we have any Kleenex?\u201d I just don\u2019t think to buy them, and when I do remember, I say, \u201cWe don\u2019t really need those.\u201d But my husband and my kids really enjoy a soft nose wipe for the winter months. And the allergy ridden spring months. And probably all the months in between. I could care less, I\u2019ll use a brown paper bag, but I do grab a Kleenex if they\u2019re handy. I\u2019d rather use something that\u2019s reusable, though. So, hello, old fashioned-ness. (I have the same goal for nursing liners, but I won\u2019t go into great detail there. Details about Kleenex usage are quite enough for one day).\n\n-Reduce our dependence on boxed cereal. There are lots of reasons this is a good idea, one of them being most cereal doesn\u2019t keep my kids full past 8:00 a.m. Another reason is a lot of those colorful boxes pose major recycling problems. Another reason is it\u2019s mostly gross and we throw out half of the box. Is there a drawback? Oh yeah, cooking and washing dishes before 8:00 in the morning. Dear friends, bring on the easy breakfast ideas.\n\nThose are the goals. I could think of more, but my children are pretending to be firefighters and I probably should go put a stop to their throwing open the front door and yelling \u201cFire, fire, EMERGENCY!\u201d for the whole neighborhood to hear. Because a false 911 call is even more wasteful than a Styrofoam egg carton.\n\n\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...\n\n3 thoughts on \u201cWaste Not: Part 5 of the 7 Challenge\u201d\n\n  1. SarahJ says:\n\n    We do a lot of cereal\u2026 mostly because I buy it cheap with coupons\/sales\u2026 but one of my favorite breakfasts is to mix up my granny\u2019s Swedish bran muffin recipe one evening\u2026 the batter keeps for 2 weeks in the refrigerator so I can bake a dozen at a time\u2026 or more.

        "text":"Greek contagion\n\nSince yesterday, news reports are full of comments like this:\nMany economists fear that if Greece exits the euro, it could lead to financial contagion, as investors and ordinary bank depositors in other eurozone countries may fear that their own government will follow suit.\n\nWhat does this mean? Are the Spanish looking to the Greeks as a model? That would be really weird.\u00a0Esos griegos ten\u00edan un gran \u00e9xito con su incumplimiento de las deudasHag\u00e1mos lo mismo.\u00a0Or is it a matter of queueing up? Greece has first dibs on default, and Spain just has to wait its turn. Or is this setting up a resonance in a\u00a0Sheldrakian\u00a0morphic field of default patterns? Perhaps we are witnessing the final consummation of the marriage of 21st century mathematics and 20th century pseudoscience that finance has been tending toward for the past three decades (at least).\n\nSurely the impact on investors will depend in part on the effects seen from a Greek euro withdrawal. At the very least If we think back to recent history, presumably any reasonable person would have thought, after the Lehman Brothers shit-storm, that the US financial authorities would be less likely to allow another similar bankruptcy to proceed. So, if Greece leaves the euro in a ball of flames, Spain will be unlikely to see it as a model. And if Greece\u2019s exit from the euro isn\u2019t so terrible then\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just not so terrible.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Archive for May, 2012\n\nTouring Ghana \u2013 Day 1\n\nThursday, May 31st, 2012\n\nWe had a week to kill before our reservations at Green Turtle Lodge, and no idea what to do with it. We don't really like big cities, and there is very little \u201ctourist\u201d infrastructure in Ghana, so getting around and finding places to stay wasn't easy. Inspired by Marie McCarthy's kindle book Travels in Ghana, we decided to hire a car & driver through one of the tour companies. We requested quotes from both Easy Track Ghana and Jolinaiko Eco Tours. In the end, we choose Jolinaiko largely because they had a much better price and seemed a little more flexible. Since we were returning from Benin, we wanted our tour to start in Aflao (the town at the Ghana border with Togo) and end at Green Turtle Lodge, where we already had reservations. The tour would serve the dual purposes of allowing us to see parts of Ghana we otherwise would not see, and it would allow us to get to Green Turtle Lodge without having to go back to Accra! In the end, we booked a 6-day tour, that involved visiting a Kente weaving village, an eco community, hikes to the second highest \u201cmountain\u201d and a couple of waterfalls, a palm wine brewery, a monkey sanctuary, a bead factory, the Akosombo Dam, a Lakeside lodge, and a slave castle. It was a busy 6 days.\n\nDay 1 \u2013 Aflao to Mountain Paradise\n\nWe took a car taxi from our hotel to the Ghana border. It wasn't far, but with all our gear it certainly made it easier to avoid all the border chaos on the Togo side. The actual checking out of Togo and checking into Ghana went smoothly. Just as we had arrived at a the border, we recieved a call from our driver, Fofo, saying that he had arrived in Aflao. So all we needed to do was walk away from all the touts at the border and find him. Having already arranged transportation made it much easier to get away from all the drivers offering rides to Accra.\n\nWe found it interesting that the border staff on both the Benin and Togo sides asked why we didn't speak French. In their experience everyone from Canada speaks French. We found ourselves repeating in our very broken French that only about 30% of Canadians speak French, and that most, are Anglophone. We suspect that because Benin and Togo are French speaking, it is more common for French speaking Canadians to visit here. English speaking Canadians are more likely to visit Ghana.\n\nInitially, we couldn't find the meeting place, but we were pretty obvious \u2013 two yovos standing looking at their phones \u2013 so it didn't take long for Fofo to find us. Soon, we were introduced to Fofo's beat-up 4\u00d74 Landrover (no air conditioning). We had been informed by Jolinaiko Tours that morning that the air conditioned 4\u00d74 we had been promised was broken, and that instead we would be using Fofo's Landrover for the day \u2013 with the other vehicle and driver to meet us that night.\n\nBefore leaving Aflao, we stopped at the bank machine to get some Ghana cash (Cedi). This time we used Eco Bank. At first, Becky couldn't get money, but soon discovered that it didn't work when she tried to enter a dollar amount, but worked fine when she just selected one of the values from the screen. The machine only let us take out 400 Cedi at a time (about $200). Since we had to pay the tour company in cash, and almost all our expensense would also be in cash, we each widthdrew 400 Cedi, and realized that along the way we would need to find another bank machine. In hindsight, we should have each done multiple widthdrawls (which we later discovered was possible). The Ghanian Cedi bills are thicker than the Canadian Dollar, so $200 in Cedi (mostly in 10 Cedi notes) makes for a crazy thick wad of cash!\n\nOur first tour stop for the day was at a Kente cloth weaving village. It wasn't really a village so much as a warehouse just off the main road. Becky was struck by how all the weavers were men. We paid a small fee to take pictures, and Scott took the opportunity to talk to some of the weavers. It takes them a long time to make a swath of cloth. Becky was surprised to learn that the cloth was made of a rayon-cotton blend. She expected it to be more of a traditional handmade thread.\n\nIt was 1:30 pm and we had not had lunch yet. Becky was starving. Our driver, Fofo, decided to take us to a museum before lunch. Since we paid an entrance fee for the not very impressive museum, Scott used that opportunity to ask the man there more about Kente cloth. After our quick museum visit, we headed out to a hotel restaurant for lunch. One thing to remember about restaurants in West Africa, when you order your food you can wait 60-90 minutes before you see it. Even if what you order is a \u201csimple\u201d dish. This certainly has put our local (Ottawa) Ethopian restaurants into perspective \u2013 since we are accustomed to North American restaurant time standards, we always thought the service at the Ethopian restaurant was really slow \u2013 now we realize that it was just authentic timing!\n\nAfter our late lunch, our day was not over yet. We thought we were headed towards our hotel as the day was getting on, but it turned out we were making our way to the village nearest the second highest mountain in Ghana \u2013 Mount Gemi. The drive up to the mountain village, Amedzofe, reminded us very much of a trip up to Monte Verde cloud forest in Costa Rica. The roads really needed a 4\u00d74 to traverse. There were a lot of hair-pin turns and rough patches, but as we climbed the views were spectacular. When we arrived in the town the weather was looking rather threatening, with thunder storms approaching. Rather than stop at the visitor centre, we picked up a guide and headed straight to the base of the trail. We would do the hike first, and then return to the visitor centre to register. Our 4\u00d74 made it most of the way to the top, leaving only a short 10-minute hike.\n\nThe hike and the discussion with the guide turned out to be the highlight of our day. The guide told us about his community and the neighbouring communities of the same \u201ctribe\u201d, six in total. They shared a language and were lead by the same chief. There were no trotros (mini-van buses) between the villages, and although you could see them all from the mountain top it was not easy to get from one to the other. To visit a neighbouring village you needed to hire a car and it could be over an hour drive.\n\nOur final destination for the day was the Biakpa Mountain Paradise Lodge. Unfortunately, the open air bar that overlooks the valley, which they are famous for, burned down the week before. It was a shame, as we could see the charred remains of the deck and the hillside that had burned. Fortunately, the restaurant was still operational and had a nice atmosphere. Upon arrival, we were asked to place our order for dinner. We would soon learn that this was a normal practice \u2013 ordering your meal several hours before you wanted it. After ordering and confirming how long it would take, we recessed to our room for a nice cool shower before supper. For supper Scott ordered ground nut (aka peanut) soup with chicken and fufu (ground cassava). Becky ordered stirfy vegitables with rice. When the food came, we both got ground nut soup with chicken, Becky got glutenous rice, and Scott got fufu. We would soon learn that even though something is on the menu doesn't mean they actually have it! Although this was the only place where they didn't tell us they didn't have it \u2013 they just substituted for what they had. Fortunately, the groundnut soup with chicken and rice was delicious.\n\nIt was our first stay in a \u201cbudget\u201d range hotel in Ghana, so we didn't know what to expect. It was certainly adaquate for our needs, but we were happy to be carrying our own bednet. This was the first night that we felt we actually needed it (we had used it at Marianne's but she also had netting in the windows and it wasn't really necessary there). In highsight, we would rate the hotel poorly. Compared to the other budget places we stayed in Ghana, it was expensive and not particularly clean.\n\nThe Kente clothe villiage. This particular place seemed to be the place where several different guides brought their guests \u2013 as there was another group of yovos arriving just as we left.\n\nA weaver at work.\n\nBecky climbing into the backseat of the Land Rover.\n\nA typical Ghanian school house. We found it amusing that the buildings were painted using the same colour scheme as the children's uniforms. The tan\/brown uniforms were worn by students of the government run schools.\n\nStanding atop Mount Gemi, as the weather moved in.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the cross at the top of Mount Gemi on the left side of the picture, and the rains moving in on us.\n\nThe charred remains of the bar at Mountain Paradise alongside a large terminate hill.\n\nOur hotel room with our bednet hung.\n\n\nCompared to Benin, the Internet we received from my phone was \u201chigh-speed\u201d. When the phone is acting as an Internet router, it eats the battery, so we had to plug it in while we used it.\n\n\nCrossing Togo and relaxing in Lom\u00e9\n\nWednesday, May 30th, 2012\n\nSince we were almost at the Togo border, and didn't want the inflexibility of the bus, we decided to take a taxi from Doutou to the Benin\/Togo border and then take some form of local transport (shared-taxi) across Togo to Lom\u00e9. In many ways that sounds more challenging than it actually is. Marianne arranged the first taxi for us \u2013 her usual driver picked us up and brought us right to the border. Since we'd been through the border in the other direction, we didn't find this border crossing at all challenging. We also saw the official price list for Togo Visa for Canadians and discovered that indeed we had not been ripped off. Our visas were 20,000 CFA each (a bit more than $40 CAD).\n\nFrom there, we had learned from both Logan and Marianne that after clearing customs we needed to just keep walking until we reached the area of shared taxis. We had many people offer us rides to Lom\u00e9, so getting there wasn't going ... (truncated)",
