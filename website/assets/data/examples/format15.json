        "text":"WVU 9th In ESPN BCS\u00a0Projections\n\nBrad Edwards of ESPN.com has published the Worldwide Leader\u2019s BCS Projections ahead of the official release next Sunday. Where is West Virginia?\n\n\nThis is very good news. It tells us a few things. The computers don\u2019t hate us. Our strength of schedule is relatively good and should only get better with the match-up with Cincinnati (and I guess Rutgers and UConn). Mississippi State has the chance to be a good game as well. Also, we are high enough that winning out 99.9% guarantees us a BCS berth, no matter if we win the Big EAST or not. This is also good news.\n\nWhere are some other teams? LSU is the obvious #1, Cal #2, USF #5, Missouri #6, Oklahoma #12, and USC way down at #13. Being ahead of media darlings Oklahoma and USC should give WVU fans a little excitement. As crazy as this season has gone, the national championship is not completely out of the realm of possibility.\n\nFrom my perspective, win out and the rest of it will take care of itself.\n\nAddThis Feed Button\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"28 Nisan 2013 Pazar\n\nA Turkish Poet on Armenian Reconciliation\n\nCahit Koytak, born 1949, is probably the greatest living poet of the Turkish language. He is a devout Muslim, a man of vast and philosophical vision, a jazz lover, a latter-day Sufi. He published this poem on April 24, 2013, the 98th anniversary of the Armenian tragedy.\n\nKoytak is a difficult poet to translate \u2013 his sinuous syntax hardly carries into English, and the suggestivenes of phrase may sound hollow to unfamiliar ears. I have done my best. You must take me on my word that the original, here,\u00a0is good poetry as well as a powerful call to action.\n\n2015, The Year of Armenian Homecoming \u2013 A Poet\u2019s View\n\nShall we be reconciled when we admit to be the heirs of Union and Progress,[1]\nthat band of devilish murderers,\nand apologize in their name? \u00a0\n\nShall we, who swear by the honesty of the Prophet and witness to the unity of God,[2]\nwe who never stood, never stood willingly, in the ranks of those murderers\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in their path of rage and bloodshed,\nshall we ask for reconciliation\nfor having never moved a finger to seek justice and to redress the crime,\nfor nearly a century,\nthough we all knew of the enormity of the crime,\nand knew the perpetrators,\nand yet pretended that there was nothing amiss,\nand tolerated those who said so?\n\nShall we seek reconciliation,\nwe who are the other members of the same great family, sharing the same house,\nfor failing to see, blindly, for so many years,\nthat what was done to them, and to their children, was done to us,\nand that their pain, and the pain of their grandchildren, was our pain,[3]\nand for doing nothing to call out for justice, and to lighten their burden?\n\nShall we offer reconciliation\nfor our indifference, our carelessness, our blindness?\n\nFor sitting on, or for keeping silent while others sat, for so many years,\non \u00a0the homes, on the gardens and fields and the villages\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 from which the Armenians were driven so brutally?\n\nOr, to deserve a great and true reconciliation,\nfor all this and for all our other debts and perfidies,\nshall we open our heart wide enough,\nand invite them back into it, their home?\n\nShall we open our heart wide enough,\nto deserve a true and great reconciliation,\nthat we wish them to come back, with joy and trust,\nto the homes, the villages, the fields and gardens which are theirs,\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0and see to it that they do so safe and secure, and with a cloudless heart?\n\nShall we make our table broad enough,\nto deserve this great redemption,\nthat we tell them \u201cthe earth belongs to God, and is wide enough;\nthe earth is His, and we are His family;\nHis is the land, the house, the shop, the fields and the grain that we all share at His table,\nHis bounty is large enough to be yours and ours, and this country[4] is your land as well as ours?\u201d\n\nShall we open our bosom wide enough,\nthat we reach across the frontier at Ardahan[5], and call,\n\u201csee, we live under the same skies,\nthe same rainclouds wet our fields and our forelocks,\nour dreams share the same night,\nso let us fling open not only the gates,\nbut the boundary itself,\nand render it as nothing,\nand let our arms which reach out to embrace you\nbe long enough to circle the globe,\nto Peru, Argentina and Arizona,\nto embrace your spread-out seed\u201d?[6]\n\nShall our hearts generate a joy great enough\nthat we proclaim the year 2015 \u201cThe Year of Armenian Homecoming\u201d,\nand turn it into a year of\nhomecoming feasts,\nhomecoming rites,\nand homecoming follies?\n\nShall our soul generate candor and goodwill enough,\nand kindness and love great enough to fill the heavens and the earth,\nthat we invite the lost sons, the lost daughters, and the estranged children of this family,\nnot only back to their homes in their homeland,\nnot only to their homes and gardens here,\nbut back to their homes in our heart,\nto the gardens and fields that blossom in our arms,\ninto the mountains and valleys of our inner soul?\n\nShall we, to deserve this year of 2015 as a year of Birth,\nnot only for us and the Armenians, but for all mankind,\na year of homecoming, a year of rediscovery,\na year to breathe in the spirit of God, and the great communion that embraces us all,\ncan we, the Muslims, weep for those children and women, and the elderly,\nwho were driven from their homes, murdered, allowed to perish on the road,\nabused and soiled and dishonored,\nby the devils of that time,\nas much as we weep for the victims of Kerbela,\nfor Hasan and Huseyn, and their women and children?[7]\n\nAnd shall the year 2015 be, for them too, the Armenians,\na year of reconciliation, a year of joy and redemption,\nthat they shall deserve by weeping\nfor the pain of those other sons and daughters of the family,\nvictims of the mayhem of Hnchakists, Tashnakists and what other wild band,[8]\nloosed at a time when our house was on fire,\nand for those who, more recently,\nlost their homes and their land, and their lives, in Karabagh?\nShall they weep, as they weep for Jesus son of Mary,\nor at least lend an ear of sympathy to those who weep?\n\n[1] The Committee of Union and Progress (\u0130ttihat ve Terakki Cemiyeti) ruled Turkey 1913 to 1918, carrying out the ethnic cleansing of not only the Armenians, but the Greeks, Bulgarians and others as well. The Turkish Republic was founded by their direct heirs and allies. Neo-Muslim opinion in current-day Turkey regards them \u2013 somewhat facilely, perhaps \u2013 as a criminal gang that brought the Ottoman Empire down.\n\n[2] The poem addresses \u201cus, the Muslims\u201d. The phrases regarding God and Prophet are code for the Islamic aversion to the founding principles of the Republic.\n\n[3] Viewing the later generations of the Armenian diaspora as victims of tragedy is a huge mental leap for Turkish opinion. It was never, to my knowledge, voiced before.\n\n[4] The original has Anadolu. The English term Anatolia simply does not carry the resonance of the original, which has come to mean the homeland stripped of the nationalistic and exclusivist overtones of Turkey, Turkish, T\u00fcrkiye. T\u00fcrkiye is the home of the Turks, Anadolu is the common home.\n\n[5] A town near the Armenian border. The land border between Turkey and the Republic of Armenia has been closed since 1994. An increasingly vocal school of thought now maintains that the border should not only be opened to traffic, but that it should be abolished altogether.\n\n[6] The Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, has voiced the possibility of offering Turkish citizenship to members and descendants of the \u201cTurkish diaspora,\u201d i.e. all those Turks and non-Turks banished from Turkey.\n\n[7] The murder of Hasan and Huseyn, grandchildren of the Prophet, at the desert fort of Kerbela, is mourned by all Muslims, but more so by those of Alevite\/Shiite persuasion. Their murderer, Yezid, is a synonym for \u201cdevil\u201d in Turkish, and that is the word used here twice to refer to the perpetrators of the Armenian massacre.\n\n[8] Turkish public opinion is accustomed to see the Armenian nationalist parties of the turn of the 20th century as blood-soaked terrorist bands, and there has been too much recent propaganda about the bloodshed in Karabagh during the Armenian-Azeri war of 1992-1994. The poet deals with these sticky subjects gently.\n\n2 yorum:\n\n  1. d\u00fczyaz\u0131y\u0131 (bakmay\u0131n m\u0131sraya benzesin diye oras\u0131ndan buras\u0131ndan k\u0131r\u0131ld\u0131\u011f\u0131na) hakiki \u015fiir etmi\u015fsiniz, helal olsun hocam.\n\n  2.

But still.\n\nOtherwise, it was a wild, rainy, windy drive down the hill, with the leaves swirling down in front of me and dancing under the wheels of the other cars. At church, there was a group praying on this Veterans Day, so we went about our setup quietly. We have a nice rhythm and routine as we get the church ready for Sunday. The presence light creaks down on its metal cord and is doused, then is replaced and cranks up again.\n\nThe only annoying aspect to altar guild is that the hymn numbers are not big enough for their slots on the hymn boards and flutter down to the floor as soon as they are put in place. Someone bakes our Communion bread, so there is always (except once!) a ready supply in the freezer.\n\nIt's soothing to be in the nave, with the only light coming in through the stained glass. Mundane activities become meditative. . .\n\nNo comments:",

        "text":"Hazy time\n\n[Version fran\u00e7aise sur le site de La Recherche]\nI made cr\u00eapes. I remember the dough, which amused me because all the ingredients were powdered: the flour and the salt, of course, but also the milk and the eggs. I simply threw all those powders into a bowl and mixed them together until they looked like the sand, almost white, of one of the beaches where I exposed myself to the sun for the last time. Then I added water, trying to remember the right viscosity \u2013 almost liquid, not thick like for those American pancakes. I remember my crewmates, occasionally coming into the kitchen to watch me throw the cr\u00eapes in the air before catching them back, clear side against the pan.\n\nIt was not long ago. A week, maybe? A month? Two? The more I think about it, the less certain I am. What did I do that day? I remember that my shorts were stained with white flour when performing a weekly social experiment. So, it was on a Wednesday. Now that I think about it, Christiane took a photo, freezing a cr\u00eape in the air. It is by looking at this photo\u2019s properties that I figure out how long ago it happened.\n\nMaking cr\u00eapes.\n\nOutside the dome, it is quite easy for me to situate events in time; if you ask me when something happened, I can give you a relatively accurate estimation. Here, it is different. Memories blend together, time lengths are hazy. When I realized that we were past the midpoint of the mission, I was not surprised. But I would not have been surprised either if I had been told that we were a third, or three-quarters, into the mission. Situating a meal, a book I read, an argument, a joke, or an experiment, is difficult. Enough to convince me to keep a logbook, so that my memories of the mission are not, in the end, a disorganized flow of images without chronology or logical connections.\n\nPart of the explanation could be the lack of sunlight; without a clock, it would be difficult to distinguish between evenings and mornings. In my windowless bedroom, I am often surprised when I look at the time. The lack of seasons, maybe? But I think that the main reason for this hazy perception of time is the lack of variation. We are always in the dome, or in the lava fields around. Always with the same people. We take, always at the same times of the day and the same days of the week, the same tests. In spite of some of my crewmates\u2019 efforts, our food always has this typical, salty note of shelf-stable food.\n\nI become aware that I \u2013 as, I assume, almost everyone \u2013 rely on other memories to situate one among them. If I want to remember when I saw my cousin for the last time, for instance, it\u2019s easy: it was during the last Christmas I spent with my family, in December 2013. Maybe you can situate a movie you watched because it was after an evening with your friends, last Saturday. But here, remembering that it was in a white dome, just after running on a treadmill and just before rehydrating some ham cubes, does not help much.\n\nTo assess the time gone by after an event, one often relies on memories accumulated since then. If you have images of different seasons, new encounters, various places, and new experiences, you know that quite some time has gone by; a year, maybe? If you only have memories of days at work, evenings with your family and a weekend by the sea, you don\u2019t have to think much to attribute this event to last week. But when all that comes to your mind is a blurred image, where only walls and furniture are clearly defined, the task is much trickier.\n\nFortunately, in spite of a daily monotony, unusual events happen that mark the passage of time. Finding the closest event to a memory helps situating it, albeit vaguely. Here, rather than in weeks or months, time is measured in earthquakes, celebrations, technical failures. If I try to remind myself of the mission, from the beginning to now, those peculiar events interrupt a confused flow of images from the dome and rocks.\n\nThe beginning comes in high resolution. I can see the landscape passing by the window of a four-wheeler. I can see media crews trying to tear catchphrases from us, at a time when we would just like to silently enjoy our last moments outdoors. The only answer that crosses my lips, towards which points a microphone, is \u201cHere we are\u201d. Part of the foam covering the microphone is gone; did an angry interviewee suddenly bite it and tear a piece away, like a shark? The idea makes me laugh, and only cameras pointing at me dissuade me from biting\u00a0another piece away. I remember the noise and bustle just before entering the dome and, suddenly, after the door has closed, the silence. The look I have around, at a decor that then looks foreign, thinking that all this \u2013 people and objects \u2013 will soon look extremely familiar.\n\nThen, only a few clear images separate segments of the blurred and continuous mass of my memories. Some images make me smile; for instance where the group, bonded and solid, is laughing at a joke to which everyone adds. Or where we explore lava tubes for the first time and our lamps, piercing the darkness, reveal rocks with surrealistic colors and shapes. Others are quite painful. Terrorist attacks in Paris, watched through frustratingly scarce pieces of information. Messages telling me that my paternal grandmother has undergone a murder attempt and that brain damage has made her, after coming\u00a0out of a coma, extremely aggressive. Christmas celebrations turn into gatherings in a hospital room, and all I can do to support my family is send derisory emails. Other images run through my mind: the first time I put my suit on, the strongest earthquake I have experienced, arguments, moments of intense complicity or tenderness, a nocturnal EVA under an incredible number of stars\u2026\n\n2016-03-30 Fun in the cave\nExploring a lava tube.\n\nWe have 5 months left. Is that a long time? I don\u2019t know. But I am convinced that other events are waiting for us that will leave more of those clearly defined memories. I am looking forward to discovering them.\n\n\nOne thought on \u201cHazy time\n\n  1. frank says:\n\n    L\u2019inquietante nulla (L\u2019Aquila 1993)\n\n    Rugginose sabbie di Marte,\n    migranti dune, disseminate rocce\n    scabre: superficie desolata\n    a perdita d\u2019occhio d\u2019astronauta,\n    crivellata di meteoritici crateri,\n    velata da polvere brunastra.\n    Singolare scenario di albe,\n    azzurre nubi ai bordi di regioni\n    spaventose, talora spazzate\n    da estese libecciate, furiose.\n    Dai ciclopici vulcani dei mari Eoi\n    all\u2019intricata rete di faglie,\n    di ocracei canyon, di alvei\n    abbandonati, immenso altipiano\n    si erge, ma l\u2019inquietante nulla\n    qui vi domina assoluto.

I kind of think they are mostly for the mama. She saw four walls and had a vision. A vision full of hopes and little moments, of snuggles and kisses. This is the place where her dreams come true\u2026the dream of becoming a mother.\n\nThe first time I got to plan a nursery I planned two. See, we are the rare few parents left that love having a \u201csurprise,\u201d but this means that there has to be some grace given when it comes to completing the nursery decor. Since I knew I would not have the same time to finish the space as I did with just one child, I planned this room as a gender neutral space, and left the details for after delivery. This way I could customize the room in either direction. It\u2019s definitely less masculine than it would be had I known I was having a boy, but the truth is, we\u2019re moving in less than two years. He\u2019ll be transitioning to a big boy bed at that time & most of the boy details are going to translate to the \u201cbig boy room\u201d I have in my head, full of oranges and greens and navy. But this room is about NOW. I spent every night for his first six months rocking him in the chair in this nursery, staring at the details that I adore so much. And I am so glad I invested the time in to this space. I love it. By the time he\u2019s old enough to have an opinion, he can help me create a room of his own. But right now, this is the perfect place to love on my sweet baby boy.\n\nI am not a buy a bedroom in a bag kind of gal. I want rooms that look like none other on the planet, with pieces collected along the way, often irreplaceable and unique to our home. This room was no exception. The very first piece that I found to inspire this room & the color palette here was the quilt. It set the tone for everything. I originally intended to have a bed in here, but I later changed my mind, when I figured out a way to make it work in our guest room\/office space. So orange, turquoise, lime, white, grey and pops of bright red were where I was headed. Here\u2019s my mood board (created before we knew \u201cit\u201d was a boy!):\n\nNow, some of my plans have changed (as all good designs do) and I just love how it is coming along. I am sure we\u2019ll be making little adjustments here & there, but for now, welcome to Everett\u2019s Dreamy Nursery. All resources linked throughout the post. Feel free to comment with any additional questions\u2026enjoy the eye candy!\n\n  \u2022 GIANT BUTTON: Hobby Lobby\n  \u2022 STAR KNOBS: Hobby Lobby (spray painted with rustoleum in stainless steel)\n  \u2022 QUILT HANGER: Ikea Dignetet Curtain Wire, (with four brackets total)\n\nOh, the painting. I love painting. Sometimes. [ha!] We (my dad and I) painted this room beige the first time. Then a chocolately orange when I got bored. Then (four years later) we painted it what I thought was the perfect gray\u2026.only to hate it as soon as we (and by we, I mean he) got two coats on. I looked and looked and the first gray, Wickham Gray, was just too blue. What if it was a girl? It was just not right. [sorry Dad!!] Back to the paint store we went again. Stonington Gray was the PERFECT shade. Whew!\n\nI planned out the stripes based on the top and bottom color\u2013I knew I wanted both to be turquoise. So I needed an odd number of stripes. I wanted them at least 12 in wide, so I did the math & started marking. (we had already painted the wall white.) I used a level to mark the lines in pencil on the wall first, then ran a line of Frog Tape along my mark. Don\u2019t bother with the blue tape. The green is a far superior option! After I had the tape up and rubbed it on well, but instead of doing my perfectly straight line trick like usual, I brushed a stroke of white over the tape line (in the section where the turquoise would go), sealing the tape to the wall. After it dried, I painted the Turquoise, Valspar\u2019s Sprinkle, over top. It took two coats to cover the white. It is the perfect shade of not too minty, not too blue turquoise. & trust me, I tried out a TON. Like, at least a dozen. The perfect turquoise is really hard to find.\n\n  \u2022 DRESSER: Ikea Expedit, on its side + feet (found in store) + (2) two drawer inserts + (2) one drawer inserts (found in store)\n  \u2022 ORANGE POT: Homegoods\n  \u2022 STRIPEY BIN: Anthropologie\n  \u2022 CHANGING PAD COVER: DIY (using this tutorial), fabric from Hobby Lobby\n  \u2022 LAMP: Homegoods\n  \u2022 WALL SHELF: Homegoods\n  \u2022 CHAIR: PB Kids Comfort Grand Swivel Glider (scored for a mere $200 at the outlet, un-upholstered) + DIY slipcover (oommmmgg) fabric: Premier Prints Chipper Twill Storm\n  \u2022 THROW PILLOW: Homegoods\n  \u2022 VARIEGATED KNIT POUF: Land of Nod (it usually sits in front of the rocker\u2026my feet don\u2019t touch the ground without it! It\u2019s necessary!!)\n\n& for the record, I finished sewing the slipcover for that chair exactly five hours before I birthed a baby. WHEW. :)\n\nAhhh. My favorite wall in the room! Too bad my back is usually to it. I originally intended for this to be an alphabet wall, but after I got the room together I decided it would be too much. AND there was no place for pictures in this room if I did just letters, so I decided to make this an eclectic treasury of goodies. All of the frames are either from Homegoods or Target. I\u2019ll source it all from left to right, top to bottom:\n\n  \u2022 CUSTOM WHALE PRINT: Tree Top Studio\n  \u2022 (2) STANDOUT MOUNTS: WHCC, of my work\n  \u2022 BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT: my work & design\n  \u2022 DREAM BIG: Barking Bird Art\n  \u2022 WRAPPING PAPER: World Market\n  \u2022 PRINT: WHCC, my work\n  \u2022 LINEN PINBOARD: Homegoods, I color-washed it turquoise & it\u2019s full of Instagrams. More on it here.\n  \u2022 BALLOON PRINT: Card, World Market\n  \u2022 CRYING IS FOR BABIES (letterpress): Sycamore Street Press\n  \u2022 WOOD FRAME: Hobby Lobby, \u201ce\u201d: Pottery Barn Outlet (I bought a standout print for in the frame and had that random \u201ce\u201d lying around since our girl name started with \u201ce\u201d too, and threw it up there to hold the place\u2026but it has actually become one of my very favorite things on that wall!)\n\n& finally, my DIY Night Light that casts the most beautiful glow on this room at night. Lord only knows how many hours I have spent staring at it. Good thing I love it so much. Full Night Light Canvas DIY here. The dresser (an old piece from college with at least three layers of paint underneath) is painted the same as the stripes, Valspar Sprinkle.\n\nIt makes me sad that this will be my very last nursery to decorate, but I am also very excited about the room evolutions that will take place as my babies grow up. I had so much fun doing this nursery and caroline\u2019s over the top girly nursery and I just know that I will be so sad to leave this house! Both rooms are so different and so fun in their own way. Both such lovely places to spend so much time in. BUT\u2026I am sure I will be ready to redecorate when we move! If I missed anything, let me know and I\u2019ll answer in the comments section! :)\n\nFor more inspiration & to see what design direction I\u2019m heading in next, check out my pinterest boards!\n\nRelated Posts with Thumbnails\n  \u2022 Rebecca - Gorgeous room! Is the crib bumper a pain to remove before naps and bedtime thou? I left that off since it was cute but the baby couldn\u2019t sleep with it and I couldn\u2019t imagine taking it out and putting it back in so many times a day.\n\n    I love all the beautiful artwork!ReplyCancel\n\n    \u2022 -shawna- - I use bumpers. I know it makes some parents nervous and each mama should make the right decision for her baby. But they never bothered me, and when I tried to remove them, it was a nightmare (dropped pacis, legs in the slats and tears galore) so I left them on.ReplyCancel\n\n  \u2022 Nicole - Shawna, this is perfect. I love you! Please move to Colorado and come help me with this house! Ha! I will buy your tickets :)ReplyCancel\n\n  \u2022 Beth - It is such a beautiful space and will be hard to leave, but at least you won\u2019t have to paint over it when he gets bigger and wants to start making design decisions. Now THAT would be hard! :) I\u2019m 100% positive this will be blowing up on pinterest.ReplyCancel\n\n  \u2022 hanna - Thanks so much for sharing. I am so making the night light for my son\u2019s room. Lately he has been scared of a dark room and I have been trying to find a solution. Love this quick, simple and inexpensive project.ReplyCancel\n\n  \u2022 Lani - Inspirational, as always :)ReplyCancel\n\n  \u2022 Amber - Will you share what your girl name was? I\u2019m curious now! My guesses based on your other two choices are: Elsie, Etta, Eleanor, Eliza, Elise, or Evelyn. : PReplyCancel\n\n    \u2022 -shawna- - haha! that name is going in the vault. God forbid our permanent contraception measure fails, I\u2019ll have it as a backup! :)ReplyCancel\n\n  \u2022 Mal - I\u2019m curious about the girl name too :)ReplyCancel\n\n  \u2022 Ashley - Love love LOVE his room.

You must\u2019ve slept last night :) I\u2019m soooo happy for you :) yay Everett!ReplyCancel\n\n  \u2022 ella @ lifeologia - I\u2019ll be honest. I should be working and I googled frames for ideas for a client\u2026. and here I go scrolling up and down your photos for over 15 minutes to be exact.\n    And I\u2019m not even needing a nursery \u2013 but I sure do want one now when I see this!\n    Incredible design. What a beautiful space mama ;D\n    Well done.\n\n\n  \u2022 Christina - Love this. I just found out I was having a boy and was thinking of blue\/orange for his nursery and this gives me even more inspiration!\n\n    Also, I have tried finding it on your blog but have had no luck. I would love to know how you approached diapering as infants. Did you cloth diaper? Did the OS fit the newborns? Did you just do disposables until they fit into them? Prefolds? I frequent the bump and it seems that many of the CD mommies advise that OS do not fit newborns and that you wil... (truncated)",
