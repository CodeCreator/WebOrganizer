Great means the final project is efficient, compelling, well crafted, and emotionally linked to your brand \u2013 something that will not soon go extinct. Great means that the company we keep are highly capable professionals who still have fun but know when it\u2019s time to go\u00a0heads down with horns out front.\n\nFurthermore, we all know what a great\u00a0story is because we\u2019ve lived long enough to have some of our own.\n\n\nDomenick Rella :: Founding Partner \/ Creative Director, Engine Brand-Makers\n\n\u201cNo pun intended, but when it comes to photography Bruce thinks big picture.

That\u2019s what lifts Bruce above other photographers.\u201d\n\nScott Scaggs \u2013 Creative Director, Clean Design\n\nBruce DeBoer is every bit the consummate professional, well-versed in just about every aspect of production.

Finlay moved to the farm of Stonypath in 1966 and, in partnership with his wife Sue Finlay, began to create what would become an internationally acclaimed garden across seven acres of a wild and exposed moorland site.\n\nCollaborating with stone carvers, letterers and at times other artists and poets, the numerous sculptures and artworks created by Finlay, which are all integral to the garden, explore themes as diverse as the sea and its fishing fleets, our relationship to nature, classical antiquity, the French Revolution and the Second World War. Individual poetic and sculptural elements, in wood, stone and metal, are sited in relation to carefully structured landscaping and planting. In this way, the garden in its entirety is the artwork.\n\nRead More\n\n\nLittle Sparta welcomes visitors in June, July, August and September each year, respecting Finlay\u2019s intention that the garden should be experienced when the trees and plants, all integral to the artwork, are in full leaf.\n\nRead More\n\nIan Hamilton Finlay & His Work\n\nIan Hamilton Finlay (1925 \u2013 2006) was a poet, writer, visual artist and gardener. He is now internationally recognised for his work in each of these art forms.\n\nFinlay was born in Nassau, the Bahamas, in 1925. Finlay\u2019s father bootlegged alcohol from Nassau into the USA until the repeal of prohibition laws in 1933, when he and Finlay\u2019s mother unsuccessfully attempted to start an orange-growing business in Florida, before returning to Scotland in straitened circumstances. Finlay himself had been sent to Scotland at the age of six, boarding first at Larchfield School near Helensburgh, then Dollar Academy.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Little Sparta Guide Book\n\nPublished in 2015, this beautiful companion to Little Sparta tells the story of Ian Hamilton Finlay\u2019s extraordinary creation, exploring the underlying themes, and introducing and explaining the significance of the main elements and artworks in each part of the garden. Featuring new photography, as well as archive material, it also shows how the garden has matured and developed over the last 50 years.\n\nPlease buy\u00a0your copy from the Little Sparta Trust as all funds are retained and reinvested in the garden.\n\nRead More",

        "text":"Our Story\n\nCobre Hand-Hammered Copper\n\nCobre\u2013Copper in Spanish--has been made by the Purepecha Indians of Central Mexico since pre-Columbian times. When the Europeans arrived in the 16th century, they found the Purepecha making domestic implements and weapons from copper found in local, above-ground mines. Father Vasco de Quiroga introduced a few refinements; however, little has changed in how the copper is worked and finished.\u00a0 Because the copper mines have long been closed, today the smiths gather and melt discarded copper for use in their workshops.\n\nFair Trade since 1994\n\nCobre is a Fair Trade company and has been \u201cFairly Traded\u201d since 1994.\u00a0\u00a0 We currently work with 7 different workshops that employ 1 to 7 artisans. Most of the people in the workshops are related, fathers, sons, uncles, cousins.\u00a0 Each workshop has its own style. One shop makes only small pieces, maximum 3\u2033 high, while another prefers to work in organic forms; pears, apples, gourds, squashes. Ramon\u2019s work is extremely fine with thin walls, while Antonio\u2019s work is thick-walled and monumental. Each piece is proudly signed by its creator.\n\nBonfire Method Video\n\n\n\n  \u2022 During the bonfire method, coppersmiths take the recycled copper and patiently heat and hammer it until the metal is \u201craised\u201d\u2013 meaning the bowl or vase walls are formed.\n  \u2022 The smith then takes a special hammer to finish the piece.\n  \u2022 Depending upon the amount of salt in the air and how often the copper piece is handled, the metal will oxidize and the finish becomes matte, as the color darkens to deep browns and reds.\n\nCobre Hand-Hammered Copper\nSusan Hebert Imports, Inc\n1801 NW Upshur Street\nSuite 390\nPortland, OR 97209",
