        "text":"Welcome to Beet Art. This is an art and design blog that looks at all different types of art and shares information, special pieces, tips for improvement, and much more.\n\nArt is part of life and it is an expression of things that cannot be said in words. For artists, their art is their language and their way of expressing their views, opinions, feelings, and struggles. Art is personal and art is powerful. It doesn\u2019t matter whether your art is pencil drawings, sculpting or graphic design. Your art is part of who you are. Here at Beet Art, we understand that.\n\nThis blog was started by Mark McRae. He is a visual artist who does watercolor painting, sculpting, and photography. He is very passionate about art and loves to share information, experiences and tips that artists can use for inspiration or to hone their craft. He also has a great and very talented team of writers. Some are artists while others are just very good at writing about art.\n\nYou will find inspiration, support, amazing tips, and a whole community of people just like you, here at Beet Art.\n\nWe welcome all artists and aspiring artists to enjoy this blog and we also invite you to share your experiences and advice.

        "text":"Arts Colony Culture\n\nThough surrounded by suburbs, the Pomona Arts Colony is an urban neighborhood that is quirky, inviting and buzzing with activity\u00a024\/7. \u00a0\n\n\nThere are murals on every street. The galleries showcase emerging artists. The shops are eclectic and one-of-a-kind. The restaurants are ethnic and mom and pop. The sidewalks serve students by day, concertgoers by night, and friends clubbing into the wee hours. Artists live in lofts upstairs and show their work in basement galleries. Musicians lay down tracks in\u00a0alley studios, sell in vinyl shops, then play in clubs and concert halls. Everyone comes out for art walks, movie shoots and music festivals. The Arts Colony is a place anyone can join and everybody can enjoy exploring.\n\nPublic Artwork and Sculptures\n\n\nThe Pomona Loft Scene\n\n\nArtists fell in love with the downtown's abandoned buildings in the late 1970s. Without permits, and sometimes without permission, they turned empty offices and storefronts into secret studios and galleries. In 1994, Pomona passed a groundbreaking live-work ordinance that officially allowed artists to live, work and start businesses in the same creative space.\u00a0Today more than a dozen historic buildings house more than 200 artist lofts, the largest cluster of lofts east of Los Angeles. They are the creative heart of the Arts Colony and home to the urban pioneers that turned it into a thriving neighborhood again.\n\nShow More\n\n\u00a9 2019\u00a0Arteco Partners\n\nPublic Artwork",

        "text":"The original Tiptoe trio of Tara Showen, Lisa Mercer and Jennifer Gustines met in 2004 while working together at a local bank. Lisa left in 2006 to pursue a financial management career and Tara followed shortly afterward to raise babies, leaving Jennifer behind to hold down the fort!\u00c2\u00a0\n\nIn late 2007, Jennifer tossed out the idea of starting a business together; something brilliant and successful that would keep them forever out of the clutches of a \"regular job\". They brainstormed their mutual interests; shopping was an obvious candidate but didn't seem to inspire any real way to make money; event planning sounded interesting but didn't look promising for the area. At this time, photography was taking a new turn toward photojournalism and this really struck a chord within them. Partnered with a mutual love of taking pictures, the idea of Tiptoe Studios was carefully pieced together. All of the tedious beginning details were taken care of; the business was formally made an LLC, they became joyful contributers to the West Virginia State Tax Department and\u00c2\u00a0 acquired their business license. In July of 2008, after taking classes, attending seminars and mastering how to edit, Tiptoe Studios was officially born!\n\nIn the early years, Tiptoe Studios was primarily an on-location studio, traveling to Harpers Ferry, Shepherdstown, Charles Town and Winchester to conduct photo shoots and ordering sessions. In October of 2010, the Tiptoe trio signed a lease for studio space on Washington Street in downtown Charles Town. After an interesting and far too involved decorating process in which 3 different visions had to be satisfied, Tiptoe Studios debuted their new studio space with smashing success! Stop by and visit us in our fabulous, spacious studio at 207 W Washington St in Charles Town!\n\nAt the beginning of 2014, we again decided that we were ready to grow! Since it has already been noted that persistance pays off, we turned our eyes to Beth Williams, a longtime client of ours who had always expressed a great interest in becoming a Tiptoe girl. We made it official \u00c2\u00a0January 2015 and love watching our business expand into the Winchester, Virginia area. Her drive and enthusiasm have already proven that great things are in store!\u00c2\u00a0\n\nIn late summer of this year, we hired on the lovely Melissa Grant as our part time office employee. She has slipped into the Tiptoe fold like she was always meant to be one of us and we look forward to solidifying her place on Team Tiptoe. If you need to pick up prints, stop by to see her and experience her friendly, always smiling attitude!\n\nThe girls of Tiptoe Studios know that customer service is the cornerstone of any successful business. They are constantly brainstorming to come up with ideas that are fresh, new and original. Tara is head of ordering sessions, communications,\u00c2\u00a0scheduling, marketing, finances and everything behind the scenes. If you would like to book a session, need information or have any issues, she's your lady! This frees Jennifer and Lisa up to concentrate on YOU, the client,\u00c2\u00a0and give you the best Tiptoe experience possible.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe girls love what they do and share a passion not only for photography but for people. With the help of their loyal clients, the Tiptoe girls are living their dream!\n\nWant more\u00c2\u00a0about each of us?
