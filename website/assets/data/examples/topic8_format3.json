        "text":"Cashmere washing and care instructions\n\nLooking after your cashmere\n\nCashmere is the finest commercially available natural fibre in the world,it is in restricted supply and is expensive.It therefore warrants being looked after \u2013 so here are a few simple tips to follow to get the most out of your cashmere.\n\nWashing instructions\n\nCashmere is one of the most delicate natural fibres in the world and when you invest in one of our pieces you should look after it with care and love. Cashmere knitwear can be hand washed or dry-cleaned. We recommend hand washing frequently following these simple guidelines:\n\nCashmere should be washed with good quality wool or cashmere shampoo or a similar detergent. Be sure the soap powder is completely dissolved before putting in the garment. Squeeze the suds gently through the garment, then rinse several times in water of the same hand warm temperature.\n\nTo dry\u2026 don\u2019t wring or squeeze hard-just lay the garments flat on a towel and ease back into shape \u2013 dry naturally away from direct heat such as radiators or sunlight. DO NOT TUMBLE DRY.\n\nWhen dry press lightly with a cool iron.\n\nCertain cashmere garments are best dry cleaned by a reputable cleaner. With proper washing and care a cashmere garment\u2019s handle will actually improve.\n\n\nAfter the first few times you\u2019ve worn your Cashmere garment you might find small balls of fibre forming on the surface. These small balls, known as \u201cpills\u201d, are caused by some of the loose fibre tangling together as areas of your garment are rubbed during wear. This aspect is akin to the fuzzing that takes place on a new carpet that has just been laid and used. In time the fibre will settle and the fuzzing disappears.\n\nThe \u201cpilling\u201d is not symptomatic of inferior quality but rather an inevitable consequence of the careful processing of this fine fibre. Pills can be easily removed by hand or by using a \u2018de-bobbler\u2019 comb available from most haberdashers.\n\nYou will find that, removing the pills in this way, the garment will actually consolidate and soften in handle and touch. Like fine wine, cashmere will improve with age if cared for properly, and will last for years.\n\n\nThese are a hazard for most natural fibre garments. There are several ways to keep your cashmere moth-free:\n\nA great method to keep them away from your wardrobe is to use scented deterrents such as cedar balls, or hanging sachets of lavender, rosemary or clove. Although they might smell lovely to us moths in fact hate the smell. To help keep the moths away hang the cedar balls around your hangers or dot them around in amongst your folded cashmere.Do remember to replace these products when their smell diminishes.\n\nAnother possibility is to freeze your cashmere garments. Simply put them in a plastic bag and freeze for a day or over night. Then de-frost them slowly and this should kill anything including moths, and moth larvae. This may sound to be a strange route but has been proven to work.\n\nThe lifecycle of a moth is about 21 days so every month it is a good idea to give your cashmere a good shake out. The moths hate being disturbed and don\u2019t like the light, so if you suspect that you have moths it may also be a good idea to air your garments in day-light as the larvae are repelled by this and will drop off your clothing if there are any.\n\nHowever the principle rule of habit is to also keep your wardrobe clean and clear it out properly every now and then, making sure you don\u2019t store dirty garments.",

It is very important that you give me accurate measurements to work from. Also, there is a resizing fee of $5 per strand plus shipping. Unfortunately this charge is necessary because, in order to resize a beaded bracelet, it must be completely taken apart, the design adjusted to the correct size and then completely re-made which actually takes longer than making the bracelet the first time.\n\nHow to Determine Bracelet Size\n\nMeasure your wrist with a flexible measuring tape where you would wear a watch. If you don't have one, wrap a strip of paper or string around your wrist, mark it then measure the length.\n\nIf you're ordering the bracelet for a gift and are unsure of the size, you have two options:\n\n1. You can order the bracelet with a lobster clasp and extender chain which will allow 1 - 2 inches of flexibility in the length.\n\n2. Use the chart below to select one of the standard sizes. Please note that these are bracelet sizes and not wrist measurements.\n\nAdult Small\n7 inches\nAdult Medium\n7 1\/2 inches\nAdult Large\n8 inches\nAdult X-Large\n8 1\/2 inches\nAdult XX-Large\n9 inches\n\nUsing the measurement you give me I will calculate the proper overall length given the diameter of the beads.\n\nIf you're still not sure what size to order, please contact me. I'll be glad to help.\n\n\nNotes About Bracelet Size and Length\n\nBeaded bracelets need to be longer than chain bracelets to fit properly because you need to allow for the diameter of the beads. For this reason, they will always be longer than the actual wrist measurement, sometimes significantly.\n\nToggle bracelets need to be even longer than other style bracelets (up to 1 1\/2 inches) to allow you to properly clasp them. Because of this, they do not fit snugly. If you prefer a tighter fitting bracelet, you should opt for a different style clasp.\n\nI make size and fit recommendations in each bracelet description and appropriate adjustments on each custom order taking all of these things into account.\n\nI measure all bracelets from end to end, including the clasp.\n\nAny bracelet you purchase will be resized if necessary to fit you perfectly at no extra charge if requested prior to shipment. Any resizing after the item has been delivered will be subject to resizing and shipping fees so please let me know when you place your order if you need the size adjusted.\n\nCustom ordered pieces are made to your specifications and will incur charges if they need to be resized as noted above.\n\nIt's not always possible to get the length exact so it may vary by up to 1\/8 inch from the length you order, but this small amount should not affect the fit of your bracelet.\n\n\ninformation graphic\n\n\nAbout the Designer\n\nAbout the Jewelry\n\n\nContact Me\n\nMy Blog\n\nSite Updates\n\nCustom Orders\n\nCustomer Service\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nEvent Schedule\n\nJewelry Parties\n\nTrunk Shows\n\nGift Certificates\n\nWish List\n\nLayaway Plan\n\nReferral Program\n\nCustomers Say...\n\nFavorite Links\n\nWholesale Inquiries\n\nSite Map\n\nhandmade jewelry reference center graphic\n\nenthusiasts and\nsome handy\nreference material\nfor everyone...\n\ndesigns by debi newsletter sign up graphic\n\nSign up for my\nnewsletter to be\nnotified of special\nsales and other\nexciting news!\n\n\n\n\nDon't worry ~ your email address is totally secure.\nI promise to use it only to send you the Designs by Debi Newsletter.",
