        "text":"The hair on my wig looks dry, what do I do?\n\nOne of the things we deal with, is perception management. Most people who purchase a wig, or extensions, are wearing hair that they don't naturally grow. Women are bombarded with commercials, advertisements and presentations of hair that are false. Whether it's a shampoo commercial showing unnatural shiny hair, or a color commercial showing someone going from a dark brunette to a light blonde with full luxurious hair, we often don't have a realistic perception of what daily hair management should be like.\n\nWhen someone says the hair looks dry, we have to clarify whether they mean dull or dry. People use those terms synonymously. Mostly becuase that's what companies selling a product will tell you. It's possible for shiny hair to be dry and for dull hair to not be dry. The amount of sheen hair has is not dependent upon the moisture.\n\nIf your wig has a light color, or an ash color, it may look dull. Just as the color #1 (jet black) looks much shinier than #1B (off black), or silky hair looks shinier than hair processed to resemble African American Relaxed texture. Glossers and other hair polishing products will restore shine to the hair. This does not mean the hair is dry, it can simply be a factor of the effect of light upon the hair. If your hair is truly dry, it feels dry. Moisture is the best remedy for this, not oil.\n\nSo maybe you feel that we haven't answered the question. Most of our customers who believe the hair is dry are actually dealing with dull hair. They have a perception issue. For instance, we have had a handful of customers complain that a bodywave or curly Indian Remy wig was \"nappy.\" The hair is naturally straight, processed with a curly or wavy texture, it's impossible that the hair is actually \"nappy.\" Perception issue. It could be \"poufy\" it could be \"big\" but not actually nappy.",

        "text":"Cashmere washing and care instructions\n\nLooking after your cashmere\n\nCashmere is the finest commercially available natural fibre in the world,it is in restricted supply and is expensive.It therefore warrants being looked after \u2013 so here are a few simple tips to follow to get the most out of your cashmere.\n\nWashing instructions\n\nCashmere is one of the most delicate natural fibres in the world and when you invest in one of our pieces you should look after it with care and love. Cashmere knitwear can be hand washed or dry-cleaned. We recommend hand washing frequently following these simple guidelines:\n\nCashmere should be washed with good quality wool or cashmere shampoo or a similar detergent. Be sure the soap powder is completely dissolved before putting in the garment. Squeeze the suds gently through the garment, then rinse several times in water of the same hand warm temperature.\n\nTo dry\u2026 don\u2019t wring or squeeze hard-just lay the garments flat on a towel and ease back into shape \u2013 dry naturally away from direct heat such as radiators or sunlight. DO NOT TUMBLE DRY.\n\nWhen dry press lightly with a cool iron.\n\nCertain cashmere garments are best dry cleaned by a reputable cleaner. With proper washing and care a cashmere garment\u2019s handle will actually improve.\n\n\nAfter the first few times you\u2019ve worn your Cashmere garment you might find small balls of fibre forming on the surface. These small balls, known as \u201cpills\u201d, are caused by some of the loose fibre tangling together as areas of your garment are rubbed during wear. This aspect is akin to the fuzzing that takes place on a new carpet that has just been laid and used. In time the fibre will settle and the fuzzing disappears.\n\nThe \u201cpilling\u201d is not symptomatic of inferior quality but rather an inevitable consequence of the careful processing of this fine fibre. Pills can be easily removed by hand or by using a \u2018de-bobbler\u2019 comb available from most haberdashers.\n\nYou will find that, removing the pills in this way, the garment will actually consolidate and soften in handle and touch. Like fine wine, cashmere will improve with age if cared for properly, and will last for years.\n\n\nThese are a hazard for most natural fibre garments. There are several ways to keep your cashmere moth-free:\n\nA great method to keep them away from your wardrobe is to use scented deterrents such as cedar balls, or hanging sachets of lavender, rosemary or clove. Although they might smell lovely to us moths in fact hate the smell. To help keep the moths away hang the cedar balls around your hangers or dot them around in amongst your folded cashmere.Do remember to replace these products when their smell diminishes.\n\nAnother possibility is to freeze your cashmere garments. Simply put them in a plastic bag and freeze for a day or over night. Then de-frost them slowly and this should kill anything including moths, and moth larvae. This may sound to be a strange route but has been proven to work.\n\nThe lifecycle of a moth is about 21 days so every month it is a good idea to give your cashmere a good shake out. The moths hate being disturbed and don\u2019t like the light, so if you suspect that you have moths it may also be a good idea to air your garments in day-light as the larvae are repelled by this and will drop off your clothing if there are any.\n\nHowever the principle rule of habit is to also keep your wardrobe clean and clear it out properly every now and then, making sure you don\u2019t store dirty garments.",

        "text":"\u2022 All products are added to your cart.\n\n\nHow to take care of your YiY bag?\n\nYiY bags are intended to last for a long time. As for any natural product, they need to be taken care of in a conscious way to ensure you can enjoy it \u2018forever\u2019 moments long.\n\nPlease be aware that full grain leather is a natural product and as such will show changes in its structure and maybe some small irregularities. Over time leather will adapt to its user and its use, becomes more supple and may show some wrinkles or folds.\n\nFull grain leather\n\nHere you find some tips:\n\n\nProtect the leather\n\nWe recommend a product to improve the water resistance of the leather. It can help leather to resist dirt and moisture.\u00a0\n\nCollonil Leather Gel is a good example and is a solvent-free gentle gel.\n\n  \u2022 Before applying clean with a soft damp cloth to remove any surface dirt\n  \u2022 Apply the product evenly with a clean white cotton cloth, followed by a dry cotton cloth to buff.\n  \u2022 Use products regularly on heavily used bags.\n\nAnother option is Collonil Wax Spray that you can spray on to protect your bag.\n\nWith any products, test a small patch on the bag to make sure it doesn\u2019t cause discoloration.\n\n\nProtect the lining\n\nThe eco cotton lining is custom and multi-coloured. This looks not only beautiful but will help you to keep stains or spills more invisible as they might happen.\n\nFurthermore you can use little pouches to store cosmetics and liquids, which will protect the handbag lining from spills and keep you organised to boot. Avoid click pens at all cost, opting for pens with caps instead.\n\nCustom eco cotton lining\n\n\nFor regular cleaning use a soft damp cloth to remove any surface dirt on a weekly basis. This will do a lot for keeping your bag looking shiny and healthy.\n\nIf the hardware on your bag might start to lose its shine, a soft cloth with jewelry cleaner should do the trick.\n\nIn case of stains we recommend to take it to a professional. It depends on the type of stain how you should treat it. In any case: never use baby wipes, vinegar or any other 'home remedy' for cleaning or stain removal. Many of these products have chemicals and substances in them that can cause damage to the colour, dry the leather out, create a build up of grease in the leather and any number of other problems.\n\n\nProfessional care\n\nFor stains and wear and tear beyond your handbag maintenance skill set, take it to a handbag repair professional. And in any case it is a good idea to have your bag treated professionally every half year.\n\n\n\nYour bag lasts much longer if you store it in the right way:\n\n  \u2022 In an upright position\n  \u2022 In the special Microfiber YiY dust bags\n  \u2022 Stuff your bags with scarves, sweaters, or acid-free tissue paper.\n  \u2022 Cross the handles over each other or protect them to avoid wear on the bag.\n\nCustom PET microfiber protection bag\n\nIn everyday use\n\nTips for every day:\n\n  \u2022 Your YiY bag likes to mix up standing and hanging down. In that way it will stay better in shape.\n  \u2022 Avoid handling your bag if your hands are dirty or have lotion or cream on them.\n  \u2022 Keep your bag out of direct sunlight and try to avoid (heavy) rain\n  \u2022 Regular use of a leather moisturizer\u00a0will keep the leather supple and free of cracks.\n  \u2022 Wipe your bag down on a weekly basis (when in use) with a soft damp cloth.\n  \u2022 Let your bag when wet, dry naturally. High-heat measures like heater or hairdryer will damage your bag.",

We promise to all clients the most considerate and all-round service can be always available. For instance, sample order service is just the best example to address customers\u2019 concern or related questions about the quality of our products. Internet makes our life and business much easier than ever before. However, it can also cause plenty of confusion to people. We just understand quite well that our clients may feel much confused by checking the online description and pictures of our diverse styles of hair. As a result, they may feel it rather difficult to make the decision as for what specific product is the right choice that is the most suitable for their individual situation. Now sample orders will help them to make the decision and thus reduce the risk of ordering the incorrect items in a large quantity.\n\nCustomers may place sample order of whatever they think that possibly gain popularity in their specific market. In addition, sample orders may also help clients to verify the quality of our products. At present, placing sample orders is available. For any items you may be interested, please contact our customer service representatives so that they can check the inventory for you. You can expect, for any hair in stock, to receive the samples in 3-7 business days.",
