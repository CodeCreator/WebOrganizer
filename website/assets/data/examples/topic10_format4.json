        "text":"Coconut fail\n\nCoconut flour and I have never really been friends.\n\nFail  1 of 1\n\nInsanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results, and for some insane reason I keep trying to act like coconut flour can easily replace other flours. It doesn\u2019t work.\n\nAt all.\n\nCoconut flour  1 of 1\n\nI\u2019m on a major tortilla kick -well, my whole life is a major tortilla kick- and was really wanting to make some beloved quinoa pita tortillas. Alas, we were out of quinoa flour, but I had a giant bag of unused coconut flour. (I think I should have realized that I never use coconut flour because it never turns out the way I expect. Like these sad pancakes.)\n\n\u201cThat will totally work!\u201d\n\nExcept not.\n\nI mixed the coconut flour with water and a little sea salt,\n\nit crumbled in the pan.\n\nAdded egg whites and baking powder,\n\nit crumbled in the pan.\n\n[This is sounding like really bad poetry at this point, haha]\n\nLivi and I ate this one covered in maple syrup.\n\nFail  1 of 1 2\n\nIt was good, but I think I can successfully say that about anything edible covered in maple syrup.\n\nThen I added a lot more egg whites -I had a whole carton that I\u2019m kind of bummed ended up being wasted- and still didn\u2019t work.\n\nAnd, in a last-ditch effort to keep the ingredients from being wasted, I tried to turn it into this recipe (another favorite) by adding a splash of apple cider vinegar, honey, almond meal, poured it into a loaf pan and said a prayer.\n\nFail  1 of 1 3\n\nMeet the crumbly loaf that never held together, destined for the trash can.\n\nFail  1 of 1 4\n\nSince I have no coconut flour tortilla recipe, I would just recommend making this. Or this. Or this. Or keep buying tortillas pre-made at Trader Joe\u2019s like I will be doing \ud83d\ude09\n\nAfter my domino effect of cooking fails, I had a glass of wine.\n\nWine  1 of 1 5\n\nThe end.\n\nAny coconut flour recipes you can recommend? Do you ever make homemade breads or tortillas? Any cooking fails lately?\n\nHave a happy Monday!\n\n\n\nPost Navigation:\n\n\n  1. Julie on April 29, 2013 at 11:04 am\n\n    This happens to me all the time. It usually happens with pancakes though and I just scramble it and eat it anyways.\n\n  2. Lisa on April 29, 2013 at 11:06 am\n\n    Coconut flour is SO tricky to work with! I know most people use tons of eggs to make it work better, but for me, who has a slight allergy to eggs it\u2019s almost impossible. Plus, I don\u2019t really want to add 6 eggs to a loaf of banana bread per-say.\n    It definitely works if you mix it with other flours, but not usually alone (that I know of).\n    Which is kind of sad hah. I do like mixing it with twice the amount of almond milk and a little stevia, for a little coconut flour \u201cfrosting\u201d. It\u2019s SO good!\n\n  3. Sharon on April 29, 2013 at 11:07 am\n\n    Hey Gina, I get the frustration! I\u2019ve had some fails but also a couple of coconut flour success stories! Check out my blog:)\n\n  4. Rachel on April 29, 2013 at 11:09 am\n\n    I\u2019ve never baked with it but I do add it to my smoothies all the time\u2013 makes them thicker. And I also mix it with almond butter sometimes to get a coconut flavor \ud83d\ude42\n\n  5. courtstar @ starsystemz on April 29, 2013 at 11:15 am\n\n    I seem to have one or two cooking fails a week, I know this when my starving hubby is pushing his food around with a that\u2019s How we learn I guess! Bring on the maple syrup\u2026have a great week Gina! Love + Shine Courtstar\n\n  6. kim @ on April 29, 2013 at 11:17 am\n\n    This is my life. I just tried to make coconut flour pancakes this weekend. In the trash they went. Tears. I know coconut flour tends to soak up liquids, so you have to use a lot more liquid and less flour, but I\u2019m still failing. \ud83d\ude41 You are not alone!\n\n  7. Hayley @ Running on Pumpkin on April 29, 2013 at 11:19 am\n\n    Haha well I think the glass of wine at the end was necessary! I have never tried to make my own bread or tortillas (aside from banana bread which is different) and I don\u2019t think I have the motivation to.\n\n  8. Mi-an on April 29, 2013 at 11:24 am\n\n    Try this paleo pancakes:\n    2 eggs\n    2 tbsp almond butter\n    1 tbsp coconut flour\n    2 ripe bananas\n\n    play around with the coconut flour. Use 1 tsp first then can add more up to 1 tbsp.\n\n  9. Liesl @ Fitnessinthekitchen on April 29, 2013 at 11:26 am\n\n    I get your frustration with the coconut flour. I\u2019ve yet to try pancakes with it, but I want to. I love my oat flour protein pancakes though, they are the best!\n    Elana\u2019s pantry has some good recipes with it, but usually a greater ratio of almond flour to coconut and almost always together.\n\n    Maybe you could start using it has a binder in amazeballs or something? A coconut flour version of those would be super yummy!\n\n    I do make homemade bread almost weekly, as we don\u2019t live near a store, and tortillas, love a mixture or whole wheat, oat flour, and flax.\n\n    Better luck to you next time with the coconut flour.\n\n  10. Jessica @ FromtheKitchentotheRoad on April 29, 2013 at 11:31 am\n\n    I have been considering home made tortillas lately but haven\u2019t actually tried it yet. Now I know not to try it with coconut flour. I have been making up more and more recipes lately, and also attempting home made bread, so I have had more cooking fails lately than I care to admit.\n\n  11. Jenni on April 29, 2013 at 11:34 am\n\n    Wah! I hate cooking fails! I made some coconut flour cupcakes a while back, and I remember them coming out rather well! Maybe you should look up a cupcake recipe! I\u2019m pretty sure most coconut flour recipes call for a lot of eggs (yolks included)\u2013much more than most standard recipes for baked goods tend to call for. Maybe that could be your problem. Keep trying! If you fail again, there\u2019s always more wine.\n\n  12. Nina @ Too Hottie For That Body on April 29, 2013 at 11:36 am\n\n    Haha! It looks like you had two glasses of wine\u2026 It\u2019s okay, I would have too. I\u2019ve got too many cooking failures to rehash. But if I\u2019ve learned anything from this lesson it\u2019s too avoid coconut flour because I don\u2019t need any help in the failure department.\n\n  13. Liz on April 29, 2013 at 11:45 am\n\n    That\u2019s so weird! Coconut flour has always worked really well for me. I use it for my protein pancakes, regular pancakes, breads, protein muffins, cupcakes, etc.\n\n  14. Emily on April 29, 2013 at 11:45 am\n\n    Thank the good Lord I did not buy coconut flour this weekend, I almost did! What is the best gluten free flour to replace whole wheat flour. I dont\u2019 really want to use potato, corn, or rice flour. I made my own almond flour but have only used that to coat chicken for a Paleo Chicken Kiev.\n\n  15. Chef Amber Shea on April 29, 2013 at 11:46 am\n\n    This book uses coconut flour (but ZERO eggs!) in many of its yummy recipes: \ud83d\ude42\n\n  16. Amanda @ .running with spoons. on April 29, 2013 at 11:47 am\n\n    I love the taste and texture of coconut flour, but I\u2019ve never had much luck baking with it. No matter what I do, whatever I\u2019m making seems to fall apart. I\u2019ve heard that adding lots of eggs is what makes all the difference, but I usually just stick with adding coconut flour to smoothies \u2013 it gives them such a lovely thick texture.\n\n  17. lucie on April 29, 2013 at 11:55 am\n\n    I failed on coconut flour too. But one time it worked when making these Banana-Coconut-Pancakes:\n    They held together and tasted fantastic!!\n\n  18. Lisa on April 29, 2013 at 11:56 am\n\n    Over the weekend I made the best cookies I have had in a long time using coconut flour,honey,eggs,coconut oil.\n\n  19. Amy Ramos on April 29, 2013 at 11:59 am\n\n    Forget coconut flour fail, I always, ALWAYS have crab cakes fail. Seriously. I can never get them into beautiful patties like hamburgers. I love me some crab cakes (or any kind of seafood cakes) but to make them is just well\u2026..a disaster. That is when I see crab cakes on a menu, I order them and simply weep a little inside b\/c I wish I could make them.\n\n  20. Sarah @ Yogi in Action on April 29, 2013 at 11:59 am\n\n    haha Wine makes everything better.\n\n    I\u2019m impressed with your persistence on trying to make the coconut flour to result in something good. I\u2019ve never bought coconut flour- but I don\u2019t think I will be now.\n\n  21. Tara on April 29, 2013 at 12:00 pm\n\n    I\u2019m a corn tortilla girl myself but my boyfriends nana makes the best flour tortillas in the world. Only flour ingredients: flour, oil and water. Everyone that tries them falls in love instantly!\n\n  22. Ashley @ Life and Fitness on April 29, 2013 at 12:04 pm\n\n    I\u2019ve never tried baking with coconut flour since I\u2019m not a fan of coconut. But I\u2019ve def had many cooking mishaps. The first time I tried baking gf bread. Ooof. It came out gross lol.\n\n  23. Camille on April 29, 2013 at 12:05 pm\n\n    The all-purpose coconut flour from XO Baking is AMAZING! It\u2019s become my go to, because I honestly can\u2019t tell a difference. But yeah, I\u2019ve heard not good things about just straight coconut flour. Apparently, it soaks up the moisture in everything like crazy?\n\n  24. Nicole on April 29, 2013 at 12:07 pm\n\n    That\u2019s often a problem with gluten free I think. I see a lot of recipes for breads that call for xantham gum which will bind like gluten. I assume that would work in tortillas as well but I\u2019ve never tried.\n\n  25. Karen W. on April 29, 2013 at 12:07 pm\n\n    I love coconut flour! I bake with it once a week, usually pancakes on Sundays. It wasn\u2019t always a successful road, so I wanted to share my no-fail pancake recipe. Give it one last go- these pancakes are sooooooo good \ud83d\ude42\n\n    \u2022 Meagan on April 29, 2013 at 4:44 pm\n\n      This is my go-to coconut flour pancake recipe. It\u2019s delicious\u2013I always make sure to use plenty of coconut milk with fat.\n\n  26. Courtney on April 29, 2013 at 12:19 pm\n\n    The only fail I see here is that your wine glasses aren\u2019t NEARLY full enough! \ud83d\ude42\n\n    \u2022 Fitnessista on April 29, 2013 at 12:23 pm\n\n      That was all we had left in the bottle- another fail!\n\n  27. Denise on April 29, 2013 at 12:22 pm\n\n    Here is a recipe for Coconut Tortillas I want to try at \u201cAgainst All Grain\u201d\n\n    Good luck! Ye... (truncated)",

She even liked drinking chai when at Indian restaurants, and made real iced tea at home (at a time when everyone else I knew was relying on sugary instant mixes).\n\nSometimes, if I begin to feel smug and daring because I'm trying out still-more-\"exotic\" teas, I remember Mom within the context of her generation and life experience, and suspect that maybe I'm not the most adventurous one in my family... quite yet!\nLast edited by chamekke on May 21st, '08, 03:24, edited 3 times in total.\nUser avatar\nPosts: 1970\nJoined: Apr 6th, '0\nLocation: British Columbia, Canada\n\nPostby omegapd \u00bb May 21st, '08, 03:16\n\nGotta say No. While most in my family are big coffee drinkers, my mom always had tea bags (usually flavored stuff) that she'd drink from time to time.

We had some nasty old tea bags in the back of the cupboard for when one was sick, vomiting, etc . . . LOL I started drinking iced tea during the terible heat wave of '88.\n\nMy husband's grandmother was a tea drinker and we have her teapot in the china cabinet. He does have fond memories of drinking tea with his nanna. She took great pride in how many steepings she could squeeze out of a tea bag.\n\nMy 6 y.o. loves to drink from my cup and will drain it. Will not take his own cup! My 14 y.o. has refused my offering of tea, until his buddy started raving about McD's sweet tea.\nUser avatar\nPosts: 593\nJoined: Apr 21st, '\nLocation: Indianapolis IN\n\nPostby ThinkingOutLoud \u00bb May 21st, '08, 06:34\n\nOne of the clearest memories I have of my Mother's Mother is of her making her famous sweet iced tea from Lipton tea bags. My Mom made the same tea for us growing up. She also introduced me to other bagged teas, mainly of the Celestial Seasonings variety. She's a singer and believed in the value of hot tea with lemon and honey as a tonic for a scorched voice. So, no, I'm not a first generation tea drinker by a long shot. :wink:\n\nCitron Green this morning, infused from leaves left in the pot from last night ( :shock: ).

Drinking quality (loose) tea is like night and day compared to the old stuff. In fact, the memories of the milky tea days kept me from trying 'real' tea for decades.\n\nRight now - coffee in my mug. Apricot green on the agenda for later.\nPosts: 19\nJoined: Apr 22nd, '\n\n\nInstant Messenger\n\nYou cannot post new topics\nYou cannot reply to topics\nYou cannot edit your posts\nYou cannot delete your posts\nYou cannot post attachments",

        "text":"Happy Birthday to My Happy Meal\n\nBy \u2022 Mar 3rd, 2010 \u2022 Category: Baby Bites in the News\n\nHappy Birthday to You, Happy Birthday to You.\n\nHappy Birthday, Dear Happy Meal, Happy Birthday to You!\n\nHappy MealI know it\u2019s hard to believe. Time flies, doesn\u2019t it? My eyes tear when I think today, March 3, is my Happy Meal\u2019s first birthday. They grow up so fast, don\u2019t they?\n\nI purchased a Happy Meal, not to eat, but to observe and blog about. Yes, I bought a Happy Meal and then placed it on my office shelf, right behind me and my computer. It sat on my shelf for a year as a silent witness to our fast food industry.\n\nIt smelled delicious for a few days. I\u2019d get a whiff of those yummy French fries every time I walked into my office. After a week or so, you could hardly smell it. My husband worried that when the food began to decompose, there would be a terrible odor in our home. He also worried the food would attract ants and mice. He questioned my sanity.\n\nNo Worries\nNOPE, no worries at all. My Happy Meal is one year old today and it looks pretty good. It NEVER smelled bad. The food did NOT decompose. It did NOT get moldy, at all.\n\nThis morning, I took it off my shelf to take a birthday photo. The first year is always a milestone. I gave it one of my world famous nonna hugs as we\u2019ve been office mates for a year now! (Okay, maybe my sanity is in question.)\n\nWhat\u2019s WRONG with this picture?\nThe photo above on the left is the one I took today. Because Colorado has an arid climate, over the year the moisture has been slowly pulled from the Happy Meal. The bread is crusty and if you look closely, you will see a crack across the top. The hamburger has shrunk a bit and still resembles a hockey puck. Yet, the French fries look yummy enough to eat. I never had an odor problem, after a couple of weeks, I couldn\u2019t even smell the fries.\n\nNow look at the photo on the right, I took it a year ago. Not much difference. The bread is plumper and the fries a tad bit perkier.\n\nWhat\u2019s not HAPPY about a Happy Meal?\nPicky eaters universally love junk foods. They won\u2019t touch veggies and sometimes refuse to eat the food their moms prepare. Out of desperation, parents give in and purchase the food their picky eaters will eat\u2026junk food.\n\nThe next time you\u2019re tempted to purchase a Happy Meal for your child, think about these photos. Food is SUPPOSED to decompose, go bad and smell foul\u2026eventually.\u00a0 When I was a kid, I remember our garbage pail for the left over food scraps was kept by our back door. After a couple of days, flies deposited their larvae (maggots) in the meat. When I would lift the lid, I would see the recently hatched maggots wiggling on the putrid mess. A fly never bothered to land on the tiny hamburger patty on my office shelf.\n\nFood is broken down into it\u2019s essential nutrients in our bodies and turned into fuel. Our children grow strong bodies, when they eat real food. Flies ignore a Happy Meal and microbes don\u2019t decompose it, then your child\u2019s body can\u2019t properly metabolize it either. Now you know why it\u2019s called \u201cjunk food.\u201d\n\nI think ants, mice and flies are smarter than people, because they weren\u2019t fooled. They never touched the Happy Meal. Children shouldn\u2019t either.\n\nSee the 4-year Happy Meal photo, Click Here.\nNo matter what, deep-fried food is unhealthy.

Happy Birthday to My Happy Meal posting went viral with multiple blogs and news sites picking it up. The Baby Bites\u2019 site is having a hard time handling all the hits. We are working on this issue. If you experience difficulty on the site or do not see your comment posted, please check back. Blessings, Nonna Joann :)\n\n  2. I inadvertently ran a similar experiment with a Lunchable. My kindergartener begged me for Lunchables like her friends, so I bought one and dumped the contents so I could use the container to pack a \u201ccustom\u201d Lunchable. I kept the bread rounds from the original lunch for measuring purposes. I didn\u2019t intend to hold on to them for long, but there they sat on the top of my microwave for months. I was in awe of how they continued to look the same week after week. Where was the mold? Eventually I think my husband got bored with my experiment and dumped them because they disappeared, but I tell that story to anybody who will listen. If food doesn\u2019t break down naturally on the shelf, how in the world does anybody think it\u2019s going to decompose in their child\u2019s stomach?\n\n  3. Although my kids have never had a Happy Meal, they still ask about them and why they are so bad for you.\n    I showed them this photo at breakfast. We all got this on such a deeper level with this visual.\n    Thanks Nona!\n\n    Peace & Be Well,\n\n  4. I did this experiment on accident, my daughter left a icecream cone (From D.Q.) in her closet, she ate a few bites and left it in there for over two weeks, when I was hanging up some clothes in her room I looked to left when I noticed a perfect looking unmelted icecream cone. I should of took a photo of it, I was shocked when I knew how long it had been there. It got a bit smaller in shape, but there was no smell, or messy clean up, it just stayed in the cone \u2013 unmelted . I never forgot that and I always wondered why it didn\u2019t melt.\n\n  5. If it doesn\u2019t decompose then what nutrients can be extracted from it? The published nutritional value for McDonald\u2019s food seems like it would be more theoretical than actual\u2026\n\n  6. Such a simple but brilliant experiment. Thanks so much for posting about this.\n\n  7. Wow. Just wow. That is strange and frightening. Thank goodness my children are not devoted to fast food:\n\n\n\n  8. I would be interested what a home-made burger and fries would look like after a year.\n    Michael, Food should decompose. Within days mold should be visible. Maggots usually can be found in rotten meat. In short order, without refrigeration the food should look pretty yucky.\n    Nonna Joann\n\n  9. I had some trouble determining which photo was the 1 year anniversary. Its hard to believe that it did not mold up at all. I wonder what they put in that stuff!\n\n  10. In a dry climate food will have trouble decomposing, especially when left in a paper sack which will soak up any excess moisture. If you live in a dry climate, of course the meal isn\u2019t going to mold how you think it is, there\u2019s little moisture to allow it to.\n    Charlotte, Yes, that\u2019s true. The dry air will delay decomposition of the food. But you\u2019d expect something. The fries and hamburger were placed in a baggie for their first show and tell. So they were no longer saved in paper. Blessings, Nonna Joann\n\n  11. This rocks! Thanks for taking the time to babysit and post.\n\n  12. Sorry to burst your bubble everyone, but this is a worthless test. Go cook a USDA prime filet mignon and let it sit on a plate indoors for a year, and it\u2019s not going to rot because it DRIED OUT. Set it outside, and it will rot.\n\n    Common sense\u2026this test is 100% worthless and furthermore, extremely misleading.\n\n    Seriously, try it with a prime cut of beef if you don\u2019t believe me. Anything that is allowed to dry and remain in an indoor, dry environment will have the same result. There are valid reasons to avoid fast food restaurants, but this is not one of them.\n\n  13. Okay, I know the climate played a part in my Happy Meal\u2019s preservation. I\u2019m well aware that this was not a scientific study. I did NOT call it an experiment. I saved the Happy Meal to observe and blog about. Which I did. I recorded my opinions.\n    You might want to take a look at these McDonald French fries which were placed in a sealed jar. It\u2019s amazing that after 461 days they don\u2019t look too different from mine> http:\/\/www.davisonshire.org\/Junk\/McMold.htm\n\n  14. I\u2019m moved from the UK to New Zealand a few years ago and noticed the difference in the junk food over here. My kids do have an occasional Happy Meal or pizza (a rare treat amidst all those veggies and fruit and home made snacks) but they are cooked to order here and you have to wait, it\u2019s kind of slow fast food! In fact my daughter had one yesterday and didn\u2019t finish it, checked the bit that was left this morning after reading your blog and it\u2019s already shrivelled and dry and I have it on the worktop and there is a fly happily munching on it (we are still in summer here). It\u2019s interesting but NZ do seem to have lots more regulations on food, I wonder if McDonalds over there would change if the public demanded it?\n\n  15. I\u2019m sure any food in an arid, mold and fly-free home would suffer a similar fate. I can tell you from experience that McDonalds food found in my car after a couple of days WAS rotting and it DID stink.\n\n    This is junk science about junk food.\n\n  16. James, I am not sure where you live that meat will last a year without rot but I live in TX and any cooked food left out over night WILL stink and be rotting by morning. If somehow it is missed and left a couple days the smell will let you know someone missed cleaning up a lil something.\n\n    I have found McD\u2019s left overs in my SUV weeks later and just like the photos above they might be shriveled but they still look like \u201cfresh\u201d and there is no stink\u2026even in our hot summer weather. My oldest found a \u201cCInnabun\u201d in its package under the SUV\u2019s seat yesterday\u2026dried out with no smell. Who knows how long that was in there!\n\n    Thanks for thee interesting article Nonna!\n\n    Mrs T\n\n  17. I might also add, that to be considered \u201cprime\u201d beef has to be aged for 2...

        "text":"Http:\/\/ - Soylent Recipe web app\n\nOver the last 3 or 4 weeks I\u2019ve been working on a Soylent recipe builder that takes the best bits from Google Spreadsheets and adds some cool features on top. I\u2019ve got it to a stage where I can show something\u2026 so without further ado I\u2019d like to present\u2026\n\nI took the liberty of creating a 4 minute screencast which demos the app which you can find on the home page (though you may need Google Chrome or Safari to view it).\n\nAnyway, if there is some enthusiasm for the app I\u2019d like to continue working to expand the feature set in the hope of creating a one stop shop for DIY Soylent makers.\n\nThanks to @bigepidemic for letting me use his recipe as a test.\n\nFeedback much appreciated!\n\n\nAwesome work! I\u2019ve poked at it a bit, and got the error:\nCast to number failed for value \u201c$121.45\u201d at path \u201ccost\u201d\n\nObviously this was my fault, but it might be useful to strip out non-numerical characters when saving so it makes it easier to copy \/ paste from an existing recipe.\n\nAs a second feature-request, I\u2019m not sure how feasible it would be from a user interface perspective, do you think it would be possible that when you select \u2018add ingredient\u2019 that you can pick from existing ingredients? They could be narrowed down by Source, Manufacturer, and Country of Origin. Or, simply auto-fill fields when it gets a matching URL ( notwithstanding, because that has the ability to create custom mixes.)\n\nWith your permission, I can throw this on the sidebar of the \/r\/soylent subreddit.\n\n\nThanks for the feedback :slight_smile:\n\nI\u2019ve now fixed the \u2018cast\u2019 error and also added your feature request whereby typing in an ingredient that already exists from the \u2018new ingredient\u2019 popup will bring up a list you can choose from. Selecting an item from that list will auto-fill the other fields.\n\nThere are tons of potential features for this app\u2026 but in the nearer term I\u2019m planning on adding:\n\n  \u2022 Comments\n  \u2022 Ingredient list and detail pages (you can see the start of this at )\n  \u2022 Nutrient list and detail pages\n  \u2022 Recipe versioning and duplication (\u2018forking\u2019)\n\nGood idea but I don\u2019t like the idea of signing up\u2026 why is it needed? What do you do with the information you get from signing up and how do you store it?\n\nPeople are posting recipes with no ingredients and one with only 2\u2026 how are you going to stop the site from being filled with useless recipes? Maybe add a \u201cdemo\u201d version where you can play with a recipe but cant save it to the site?\n\nIt\u2019s so that only the author can edit or delete a recipe. Otherwise someone could come in and delete everything or generally mess things up. Passwords are salted and sha\u2019ed before being stored in the db.\n\nAlso nice suggestion on the junk recipes. I\u2019ll add in a \u2018publish\u2019 button once someone is ready to share a completed recipe on the search list.\n\n@mrob would be more than happy for a link on the reddit sidebar\n\nGreat work Nick.\n\nManganese is missing a \u201cn\u201d & \u201ca\u201d in your ingredients list.\n\nNice Work!\n\nHow about a link to a Amazon shopping cart or similar as part of the recipe? I would not mind the recipe creator throwing in a affiliate link as well since they have done a lot of work creating the recipe and then sharing it.\n\nThanks for the recipe @bigepidemic.\n\nlooks good. would be nice if it was open source and\/or there was a way to export your data.\n\ni once made some suggestions in a thread about another soylent web app:\n\nA bug report: you can see that both of my recipes have $NaN listed as the price on the front page, though both have the correct price listed when you click into the entry.\n\nA feature request: could we write notes associated with our recipes, to explain the decisions involved in making them?\n\nAnother feature request: could we change the default order in which ingredients are listed?\n\n\nJust wanted to let you know that the app looks great. I can\u2019t wait to see how it evolves as ideas are suggested and added. Just wanted to say thanks for the work.\n\nThanks for the feedback everyone and encouragement :smile:\n\nI\u2019m currently working on a feature called \u2018Nutrient Profiles\u2019 that will let you define nutrient targets, then apply them to a recipe. I\u2019ll post again here once it\u2019s uploaded.\n\n\nFantastic, thank you!\n\nI\u2019ve uploaded a new version of the site\u2026 now with Nutrient Profiles :slight_smile:\n\nYou can also add formatted descriptions to recipes and nutrient profiles.\n\nIf anyone has more feature requests\u2026 please post them here.\n\n\nBeautiful stuff Nick, thank you! :slight_smile:\n\nMy mom is trying to lose weight, and last night she asked me to make a soylent recipe that she could use for meal replacement. I used this website to work everything out. I also have a bunch of private recipes that I use to experiment with different versions of things. So in short, it\u2019s been a great tool for me.\n\nI noticed that you added the ability to enter descriptions. Thank you for that!\n\nNow a bug report. When I click on an ingredient in any recipe (mine or otherwise), I no longer get the pop-up dialog about that ingredient. With two exceptions: in my recipes which include cinnamon and vanilla, I get the pop-up dialogs for those ingredients when I click them. These two ingredients are exactly the ingredients in my recipes which have no nutrition facts entered for them (no calories or anything else). I am on Windows 8, and I tried and got the bug identically in both Chrome and Internet Explorer.\n\nIf you are inclined to do it, it would be lovely to be able to enter upper limits for nutrients as part of our nutrient profiles. It would be particularly nice if this feature let us distinguish between \u201cI haven\u2019t entered an upper limit\u201d and \u201cI am not giving an upper limit because the ingredient is nontoxic and for all practical purposes you can put in as much as you want.\u201d\n\nThank you for everything! This is a great website, and I am hoping to see people putting up lots of recipes on it in the future.\n\nNice! Just tried this yesterday and was about to suggest editable nutrition targets. Some suggestions:\n\n  1. I\u2019d also like the toxicity profiles. For example:\n\n  2. \u201cCalories\u201d should be kilocalories (\u201ckcalories\u201d) in most places, no?\n\n  3. A few more changeable units would be useful. E.g. currency (like \u20ac, not only $) and perhaps selectable mass unit when adding an ingredient (to avoid manual conversions). The most difficult ones seem to be IU. Found a converter here but it\u2019s a bit cumbersome to work with when entering ingredients:\n\n  4. How about showing mass units in the recipe table heading also?\n\n  5. A vertical list (perhaps with a graphical bar chart, e.g. 0-500% and red when toxic!) of target nutrients under the recipe table would make it easier to see progress \/ current state of the recipe.\n\n  6. \u201cPrivate\u201d checkbox for ingredients, too, might be a good idea. Some people may have access\/preference to stuff that other people won\u2019t find useful at all (like local products that can\u2019t be purchased anywhere else in the world), and showing them as options for everybody just confuses them.\n\nGreat app. I was able to enter and edit a recipe, and I really appreciated the functionality. With the addition of the nutrient profiles, editing is broken as of now. 6:39 PDT 7\/16\/2013.\n\nI had entered some ingredients without prices, and was going to edit them with prices. With editing not functioning currently, I ended up entering in a duplicate ingredient. I see you fixed the app to handle no price entry.\n\nI would suggest that there be a monitored database of standard ingredients with the ability to have private ingredients. Inputting an accurate full nutrition profile can be a bit tricky, especially when units can vary.\n\nThanks so much for your time in producing this app. I think it has a lot of potential. it certainly has helped me tinker with my idea for a recipe that one can get up and running inexpensively within an hour of deciding to give this a try, instead of waiting a week for\n\nBy the way, I have not been able to determine the sulfur content of sulfured molasses, but it seems like a possible source for our Australian friends who cannot import Sulfur MSM. Also, a little bit of molasses adds a lot of nutrients, a nice caramel color, and a nice alternative to vanilla or cinnamon.\n\nAll oil from flaxseed is a little much. A coffee grinder works wonders for rolled oats and flaxseed, and reduces cost of oat flour to 99 cents for 454 grams.\n\nI\u2019ve just uploaded a fix for the editing recipes bug. I also added nutrient maximums which turn red in the recipe table when reached.\n\nI also added private checkboxes for ingredients and units in the recipe table headings.\n\nMore soon!\n\n\nAfter the fix, I was able to enter, edit and correct my recipe. This application is muy guapo.\n\nI made the recipe public again, now that I have a decent draft. I just had my first glass of it, and it was great. I reduced the Brown Rice Syrup to 50g because I am looking to reduce carbs a bit, and the MSM to 2.5g which is the recommended serving. The Kale was added for Vitamin K, but adds high quality protein, Vitamin C, and more Vitamin A than carrots.\n\nIf you see any mistakes in the Oat, Whey, Flax, Brown Rice Syrup recipe, let me know.\n\nConsidering how much time many of us has spent in Google and Excel spreadsheets, tweaking and updating formula left and right, I\u2019d say this is an apt statement.\n\nKeep up the awesome work @nickp, I\u2019ve since added it to the \/r\/soylent sidebar. Feel free to make a post about it, though!",

Basically, he wants it in Philadelphia. He wants it to be a BYOB. It can be no more than $25\/person AND the real kicker around 3 or 4pm in the afternoon. Any ideas? It does not seem that this restaurant exists and he is reluctant to other ideas (like in the greater Princeton area, where our office is)\n\nThanks for your help\n\n  1. Click to Upload a photo (10 MB limit)\n  1. What day of the week? Kanella is open for lunch till 3pm on Thursday-Sunday, is fantastic, and meets your price point. They start dinner at 5 so I'm not sure what is going on there in between 3 and 5 pm, but it's probably worth calling them.\n\n    1 Reply\n    1. re: Buckethead\n\n      Yea, I suggested Kanella to the woman who in charge of putting it together. She'll need to call to see if they can accomodate a later lunch. Of course it will be on a Friday so I think we'll have a harder time gettng the restaurants to want to agree.\n\n    2. I think some of the small Italian BYOBs would be interested in opening early to accommodate you. Have you called around?\n\n      1. Try Branzino, on 17th just north of Spruce. I doubt that it's within their hours, but they might be willing to open a bit early. I have been to several lovely lunches there.\n\n        How would ethnic be? Cafe Laos, on 11th St. south of Washington Avenue, is very attractive and has a huge entree selection - Laotian, Thai, etc. plus very good barbecued chickens, curries, coconut ice cream. Another beautiful place is Le Viet, at 11th and Washington. - good Vietnamese food. These have a classier ambiance than many of the other good ethnic places.\n\n        Parking is available for those places, which might make it easier, anad I think their hours are flexible.\n\n        1. I might suggest Roberto Cafe on South Street. I think he normally starts dinner service at 4 or 4:30; it's a small space but I have regularly seen them do large parties of 10-12. Very good, fresh, basic Italian (but real Italian, not Italian-American South Philly stuff) and I'm sure they could arrange something nice for that price.\n\n          1. Olive on 3rd is one of the more reasonably priced BYOBs I've enjoyed recently. The owner seemed very accommodating. Might be worth a call.",

The hubby ordered a lobster roll, the most expensive item on the menu. To his great disappointment it had absolutely NO flavor. The waiter, a very nice young man stopped by the table to ask us how we were enjoying the meal. I was shocked to hear my husband say that it was very good. Had he suddenly lost his mind? I think he was just too shy to tell the waiter what he really thought. When faced with this situation, how do you answer?\n\n  1. Click to Upload a photo (10 MB limit)\n  1. Not from the area but I think for major issues one should answer honestly yet diplomatically.\n\n    If something it too sweet, too salty, too spicy, too bland then a simple \"It was fine but too XYZ for me\".\n\n    If something is not cooked correctly than that should be pointed out right away.\n\n    If something tastes off, is inedible, etc than that warrants talking to a manager.\n\n    That said if you eat the whole thing then keep your mouth shut. It can't be all bad if you wiped the plate clean.\n\n    2 Replies\n    1. re: foodieX2\n\n      A good answer that I totally agree with, but let me add my 2 cents. I think that if you are going to complain about anything, it has to be done in a constructive manner with specifics so that there could possibly be improvements in response to the criticism. If I'm asked if I'm enjoying my meal, I'll pretend that I am unless I have something specific to complain about more than just saying that the food is merely so-so. Telling a server that you are vaguely unhappy without providing the exact details needed for possible remedies will just spread bad sentiments without doing any good. I've had my share of mediocre restaurant meals where I've pretended to be perfectly happy simply because I didn't feel I had the time and energy to provide possibly unwelcome advice about how they could do things better.\n\n      1. re: foodieX2\n\n        Perfect answer, foodiex2. And in the OP's case, her husband should have used your first response.\n\n        I'll also add my 2 cents and say bland or \"no flavor\" is highly subjective. Does the OP's husband smoke? If so, that fact alone would mask any subtle flavors. Does he regularly enjoy spicy foods? That too could be a factor. I'm not saying these specific things are true on his part, just throwing out a couple of examples. Also, I'd be curious to know if the OP tasted the lobster roll and what she thought.\n\n      2. Depends.\n\n        In most cases, I take the view that this is a perfunctory question that the restaurant feels it needs to ask and has no real intent to take on board any comments\n\n        On the other side of the coin, I find that most \"good\" places I go to do not feel the need to do the check back. To my mind, they are right. They may well ask how was the dish, when they are clearing the plate. I tend to think there is some genuine interest here and I can usually get a sense of this from how the server asks the question. In such circumstances, I'll be honest. In other circumstances, my standard response is to say things were \"fine\".\n\n        2 Replies\n        1. re: Harters\n\n          That could be.\n\n          I take it to actually elicit feedback, and I will give that.\n\n          I have had a few instances, where the chef wanted to defend their choices. That is fine, but I also want to defend my comments.\n\n\n          1. re: Harters\n\n            Yes, but that is a difference between where you live, Harters and the US. The check back, is to give people the chance to say something if they need to, in fact there are complaints that not checking implies not caring.\n\n          2. Don't rave about it if you didn't like it... if you don't want to go into details just say it was 'okay'. There's absolutely no point in telling the waiter how wonderful it was when you found it mediocre. That just encourages them...\n\n            1. I would have sent the lobster roll back because it had no taste and ordered something else (quickly). It is probably not the restaurants fault it lacked flavor but they should know about the problem.\n\n              I rarely send anything back. I usually just eat it and say \"fine\" when it really wasn't that great. But not at a high end restaurant where I order the priciest item on the menu.\n\n              2 Replies\n              1. re: sedimental\n\n                If it's not the restuarant's fault, as you state, why should they know about it? What is the \"problem?\" I the \"no taste\" lies totally within the customer's palate, that's the customer's \"problem\" and no need to tell the restaurant.\n\n                1. re: ttoommyy\n\n                  Many times lobster that is frozen has no taste (especially in CA). Not their fault, meaning not a prep issue. I wouldn't automatically assume it was \" just me\". My taster works pretty well unless I have a cold or something. I don't think a high end Yountville restaurant would want a customer not satisfied with the food but not saying anything and possibly not returning or telling others \" the lobster rolls arent very good\". YMMV.\n\n              2. And then you have an astute staff. In Asheville, N.C. at a local mid to high end chain. She Who No Longer Must Be Obeyed ordered a Caeser salad as an entr\u00e9e. And out comes a large bowl of mixed greens and croutons with the dressing in plastic containers.\n\n                So She poked and prodded, ate a little, and then sat there in low dudgeon. Waitress came up and asked her what was wrong. What She was hoping for was a tableside mixing at the most, or pure romaine lettuce and fresh dressing at the least for that price. Waitress got the manager, he took the salad off the tab, gave her a chicken breast that did not come out of a bag, She was content.\n\n                Please note that this was done without a complaint or query about the meal. We were obviously tourists and it was during the Sunday church crush, so it was not like they were sitting around bored. If I could remember the name of the place, I would be shouting it out. The tip was grotesque.\n\n                And yes, if I am disappointed in what is offered, I either clean my plate if edible and worth the money,(my generation), or inform my waiter if not. Before I consume the whole thing.",

        "text":"Thursday, 5 September 2013\n\nFit Sugar's Banana Apple Chunk Bread Modified | Food & Drink\n\nHello there! I've been a tad busy lately as you may have figured- hence my absence.\u00a0 Today I want to show you this freaking incredible dessert.\u00a0 This is a recipe I found on Fit Sugar, and the recipe is called Low Fat Vegan Banana Apple Chunk Bread. If you click on this link it will take you to the original recipe, and the site provides you will nutritional content.\u00a0 My version has very few changes so the nutritional content should be about the same. I modified a couple small things, and turned this bread into muffins!\u00a0 These are the most moistestest (it's a word now) muffins in town.\u00a0 It's like they are dense AND fluffy at the same time.\u00a0 They are best when you warm them up in the microwave for about 50 seconds and put a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream on top- YUM.\u00a0 Might as well forget about the nutritional content on Fit Sugar, because now you are eating ice cream, and probably eating like 3 servings of this- just saying.\u00a0 You will thank me.\u00a0 I've never seen Mark so excited about a dessert before.\u00a0\n\nYou will need:\n3 ripe bananas\n1 apple, peeled and diced\n2\/3 cup brown sugar\n1 3\/4 cups whole wheat flour\n1\/2 cup applesauce (I used unsweetened cinnamon apple applesauce, and put in 2 of those small cups that you would buy in packets at the store)\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon salt\nSprinkle of cinnamon\nCrushed pecans to sprinkle on top of the muffins before baking\n\nSo the modifications I made were:\u00a0\n-brown sugar\n-3 ripe bananas\n-cinnamon applesauce\n-crushed pecans\u00a0\n-made into muffins\n\n\u00a0Pour the batter in the muffin cups or in a loaf pan, and put in the oven at 350 degrees.\u00a0 For the muffins, it took about 15 minutes or so until they were ready.\u00a0 Just watch that the tops are turning brown, and when you stick in a fork or toothpick that it doesn't come out super gooey.\u00a0\n\nThis is the batter\n\nWas a good breakfast treat (or any meal)\n\nDo this- it is amazing\n\nLet me know how you like it! I would give this like 6 out of 5 stars... hehe. Enjoy!\n\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nHey There. I found your blog using msn.

        "text":"What restaurants are on your rotation?\n\n\nStarlite on Saturdays, Truluk\u2019s on Sundays for HH. Antica for lunch or dinner.\n\n\nAfter trying Phatties food truck (where they park varies but I found it at mossy Nissan Escondido), it will be on my regular rotation.\n\nHad a chorizo pambaso and a spicy pork\/chicharron gordita\u2014both were very good.\n\n\nFor gelato lovers, this week Ans Dry Cleaning is opening up in North Park @ 317 Adams Ave.\n\nWe had a tasting this weekend and I think folks will be in for a real treat.\n\n\nI saw this place a few months ago and did a double take at the name. Is there a story that you know about?\n\n\n\n\nThanks Honkman, nice to see you posting here. Hope the Boston food scene is interesting.\n\n\nLiving in Boston is quite nice as this feels like a real city compared to SD which is quite spread out (but we miss warm winters). But living in Boston made as realize also two things regarding food - the produce (and to a certain degree access to local meat) in SD is unbelievable good and you tend to forgot it when you live in SD. Even at peak season in Boston local produce is disappointing compared anything you get in SD. But on the other hand it made us also realize how bad the restaurants are in SD. The level of cooking (and willingness to experiment with dishes) in restaurants in Boston is so much higher than SD especially considering the much better produce and we are not talking about high-end restaurants but average, neighborhood restaurants (and Boston is on average not a richer or more expansive city than SD). We live not in the middle of the city but also not too far away (perhaps comparable living in Scripps Ranch or Del Mar distancewise) and we have simple neighborhood Italian restaurants who make their own pasta etc or small Chinese restaurants with hand pulled noodles etc. which nobody would consider here as uniquely good restaurants somebody would drive a long distance but these two restaurants would beat 90% of all restaurants in SD. My wife and I are talking quite often that we now understand even less what is holding back the restaurants scene in SD (our current thought is that the quality of chefs in SD is lacking and they just can\u2019t cook on that level)\n\n\nGoing down to SD for Labor Day weekend. Planning on hitting up some new spots\nIronside Fish & Oyster\nYakitoi Yakyudori (lady said to call a week ahead for reservations). Does this place get crazy even at like 5:30-6pm?\nCarnitas Crack Shack after the zoo before Del Mar\nWe\u2019d add Buona Forchetta but the wait is tough\n\nWe\u2019re venturing to Coronado Island one day. Anybody have recommendations here for a casual lunch?\n\n\nYou should check out Dija Mara and Wayfarer Bread & Pastry.\n\n\nBoth look very good. Both are far away from our hotel in Downtown. Will bookmark them for when we are driving down.\n\nThe Dija Mara menu looks fantastic. Would order 1 of everything.\n\n\nBorn and Raised, as well as Bar Bodega.\n\nMaybe check out the new Food Hall. I know I will if I\u2019m down there this weekend.\n\n\nThe new Little Italy food hall? Let us know if there was anything you recommend.\n\n\nAn\u2019s Dry Cleaning\u2013Made it in a couple of weeks ago as they opened. Over the top nice\u2013they urged me to taste each of their featured flavors before choosing. I graciously agreed to \" suffer\" through their tour. Wow! Some inventive and great flavors! The watermelon sorbet was fantastic: I had to get it, even though I am a devote dairy fan.\n\n\nBorn and Raised looks good. Will be in town for 3 days and was looking for places close to False Idol. Bencotto was one night, made res for BAR. Thanks.\n\n\nWell, you\u2019re in the heart of Little Italy.\n\nIf you want to stay in that area, then RoVino, Nolita, Bar Bodega, Barbusa and perhaps Juniper and Ivy are all good options.\n\nIf you want travel a bit north of Little Italy to North Park and the surrounding areas, then Tacos Libertad, Cantina Mayahuel, Trust, and Buona Forchetta are all solid choices.\n\nEnjoy your visit.\n\n\nThanks for more recs. I\u2019m meeting a friend who just finished 5 days at Comic Con :scream: and is staying on Coronado, so I don\u2019t know how much energy she has.\n\nOur main thing is every night opening at False Idol and eating nearby, because we go back after dinner.\n\n\nIn addition to ipsedixit\u2019s very good recs,\n\nMaestoso in Hillcrest\nAmbrogio15 (only had in La Jolla but now with little Italy location)\n\n\nHave not found much worthwhile in Coronado but haven\u2019t spent tons of time looking either.\n\n\nSame. Was probably going to go to Brigantines but the food is just ok and expensive. Doesn\u2019t feel the same if you\u2019re not a little tipsy and didn\u2019t just lose a bunch of money betting on the ponies.\n\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you just say Tartine and Proof alum. I\u2019m trying to rearrange our morning schedule so we can pick up some pastries and bread for a morning meal.",

        "text":"About Me\n\n  \u2022 Hello! Thank you so much for visiting me in the Attic, it's lovely to see you. My name is Lucy and I'm a happily married Mum with three children. We live in a cosy terraced house on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales in England which we are slowly renovating and making home. I have a passion for crochet and colour and love to share my creative journey. I hope you enjoy your peek into my colourful little world x\n\n\n  \u2022 Favourite Crochet Blog & Favourite Crochet Designer\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Instagram\n\nPatterns and Tutorials\n\n\u2665 buy me a coffee \u2665\n\n\n  \u2022 Hello!\n    src=\"https:\/\/attic24.typepad.com\/Lucy150x150.jpg\" >\n\n\u00ab More Snow + Yarn | Main | \u2665 Three Things \u2665 \u00bb\n\nJanuary 29, 2013\n\n\nFeed You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post.\n\nKathryn Payandeh\n\nJust have my muffins in the oven 5 minutes to go.They look amazing.Made them in silcon muffin mould no need for cases then.Although they are pretty in case.Made grated apple with freeze dried raspberries.Thank you for the recipe Lucy Best Wishes Kathryn\n\n\nThanks for the recipe, my friends and I loved those pretties. I added a link back on our blog :-)\n\nEinat Cohen\n\nthank you! they were everything you promised and more!\njuicy, soft, not too sweet, addictive..and the smell!! seductive...\nWe made them this morning with apple and raisins and dates and I gulped my girls' leftovers ;-)\nI am talking about them in my blog today, although in Hebrew.\n\n\nI will definitely be trying these! My tummy (and my children's tummies if I manage to share!) thank you!\n\n\nWill give these a go, look fab and great quantity, enough for one family sitting. We made flap jacks today, a great thing to do with or without the children around. Pop over and see what you think, oh yes a bit of crocheting on the post too! http:\/\/eclectichomelife.blogspot.co.uk\/2014\/02\/rainbows-wristwarmers-and-flapjacks.html\n\n\nMy youngest is gluten free. This was an easy recipe to convert! To my gluten free ingredients I added an extra 1 1\/2 tsp baking powder and 1\/2 tsp baking soda. We added frozen fruit to some and chocolate chips to others. They were light, fluffy and delicious! Thank you for such an easy recipe, the delightful peeks into your home and crochet projects. Blessings from across the sea. Robin\n\nLouise B\n\nThank you so much for this recipe. It has been a staple since our oven broke a few weeks ago. I can quickly mix up a batch of 6 and cook them in our fan oven microwave in no time.\n\n\ngot to try these muffins \"!\"! love the little blankets inspired to do these for charity soo cute\n\nANB of Suburban Sonnett\n\nThank you for this, we have just made them for the second time in a week!\n\nFiona Scott\n\nThoroughly enjoying reading about your lovely family and I think I now feel brave enough to try crochet! I love making muffins though trying to lose weight so not making them too often!\n\nLiz Moynihan\n\nJust made these with frozen raspberries straight from the freezer. Worked well. Next up - blackberries from the freezer? apricots snipped from the bag? Endless possibilities. Thanks for the recipe. Like all of yours I've tried, it worked first go. PS also regularly make the lentil bake you posted ages ago - and add crunchy peanut butter instead of salted peanuts. Luvverly!\n\n\nThanks for sharing your recipe and for including the US conversion. I've been craving muffins lately myself. :-)\n\n\nThe US conversion is CORRECT to have the baking powder added. Self rising flour is used mostly in the South. All Purpose (AP) flour is universal in the US and has no leavening, so anyone not having SRF (incl. Europe) can just add about two healthy pinches of baking powder per cup of AP flour or cake flour for this recipe to work.\n\nA key to good muffins & cakes is to NOT OVERMIX. Fold in the flour to wet ingredients and fold only until all the dry ingredients lurking at the bottom are incorporated. Don't beat, because the leavening starts to work as soon as it hits the moisture. You can easily beat out the rising bubbles! Have oven hot and ready for the muffins to go in the minute the tin is filled. This way you'll get the light texture of Lucy's muffins. Making some blueberry muffins today--thanks Lucy for the hint about snipping the ras-bries before sheet-freezing.\n\nMelissa L.\n\nWonderful idea for adding delicate fruit to the muffins - plus, an equal amount of fruit in each one! I really get annoyed with a muffin with only TWO blueberries!\n\nThank you to your reader Hannah for converting the measurements to US terms for us Yanks.\n\n\nHi Lucy, many thanks for posting the muffin recipe! I have just made a batch of blueberry muffins using your recipe and they are wonderful and a big hit with everyone here. THANK YOU!!\n\n\nWELL me muffins were delicious! very easy and the hit of Raspberry in the middle is gorgeous. Thank you for posting this\n\n\nWow - a recipe which really works! I've tried lots of muffin recipes before and never really had much success. But I've already tried a double batch of this one (half blueberry and half raspberry) and they're fab. Thank you so much :)\n\n\nMjamm, the muffins look terrific!! I also have bulbs throughout my livingroom, they have such a fresh and innocent appearance!\n\n\n\n\nOk just got me rasps, off to do a muffin bake!\n\n\nYUM. Mine are in the oven now. Replaced milk with apple juice for more appley flavour. Is \"appley\" a word? Well it should be. Lovely smell filling the house.\n\n\nGreat post Lucy. Will try your fruit adding technique next time I make muffins. Raspberries and blueberries particularly make for odd coloured muffins when you mix the fruit in the batter!\n\n\nI made your muffins yesterday. My first attempt and they were a success! :) I put banana inside. I am planning to buy a second muffin form and try make more ;) and with berries.\nThanks for sharing the recipe, it's great!\n\nMary Polensky\n\nLucy, I made a batch last night and ate 2 of them right out of the oven. Yum. I only had fresh blueberrys on hand, and they worked great. Thanks for an easy but yummy recipe.\n\nLiz Robertson\n\nThank you Lucy! Made a little batch straight after reading your blog yesterday. Apple and dried cranberry. Yummee! And yes they are so easy. Only change would be to make double the amount next time.\nNothing beats a freshly made cake and a cup of tea to make me nostalgic for 'home' in a nice, happy kind of way.\n\nSonia Petitpoint\n\nThey look delicious !\n\nVerify your Comment\n\nPreviewing your Comment\n\nThis is only a preview.

Suffice it to say that I am very impressed with the local Ohio products that they employed in dishes like Grilled Sardines with Parsley and Olive Salad and Beef Tongue with Salsa Verde. Italian \"Peasant\" dishes if you will with a unique twist using locally sourced ingredients. I'll post a bit more tommorrow.\n\nLast night I had dinner at Zack Bruell's Chinato. What a wonderful experience-simple,Italian \"peasant-style\" dishes in a relaxed atmosphere with superior service and a comfortable, everyone-having-a-good time personality.\n\nI started with the Grilled Sardines with Parsley and Olive Salad-\n\n\nThen followed with the Tongue with Salsa Verde. So simple and plain sounding, but it was the most expressive, flavorful tongue dish you will ever sample. The tongue had been slowly braised until fork tender, but then, something I would have never imagined-the tongue was sliced in medallions and pan-seared. A blend of both soft meat with a crispy exterior. And the \"verde\" was made from pea shoots and chard, along with a good dose of lemon, olive oil and red pepper flakes.\n\nDessert was Almond Panna Cotta.\n\nFor the first two courses I asked the Waiter to select a glass of wine to go with these challenging dishes-oily, grilled sardines, then rich beef. He didn't disappoint-the mark of a great Waiter. I chose the dessert wine and it was sadly not up to the mark. Leave it to me to try to select a wine for Panna Cotta.\n\nThe prices are incredibly reasonable for food of this quality and such fabulous service. (The bread probably outshines everything). The Tongue entree was a mere $17.

I lost track of all the dishes after about 3 bites of the first appetizers. My favorites from last night were the Fried Chicken Livers and Mushrooms on Polenta at Lolita and the Pepper-Crusted Duck with Ginger-Mango Vinaigrette at Dante.\n\nAnyone else out there have a favorite dish from Thursday night?\n\nShare this post\n\nLink to post\nShare on other sites\n\nWe do indeed have a gem in Chinato, glad others are finding that one as it's one of my faves.\n\nI have to agree that the chicken livers\/polenta\/killbuck mushrooms\/house-made bacon dish at Lolita was the star of the night for me. And just from a personal preference standpoint, I actually thought Rocco's pizzas from Farenheit were better than the Lolita pizzas, but I like a crust that's not too dark and more even toppings than a traditional pizza, and Rocco's hit that mark. Good thing I don't live in Tremont as those would be a regular late-night snack. The house made potato chips with, apparently, crack sprinkled on them from Farenheit were also really good (I think it was bacon\/scallion\/parm\/truffles but I could be wrong).\n\nLooking forward to seeing everyone at GHT tonight.\n\nShare this post\n\nLink to post\nShare on other sites\n\nI don't think it will be possible to keep up with the pace of events, posting-wise, but here are some bad photos of what has happened.\n\nShoeing the horse yesterday, and the truck the guys showed up in.\n\n\n\nLunch at Pura Vida was great, especially my chicken-salad-sandwich with grapes and almonds, in a cool lunch box presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSnacks at Fahrenheit.

If you have a great place like AMP 150 in your airport Marriott, then it's pretty evident something special is going on your town.\n\nWhat I experienced yesterday is ... (truncated)",

        "text":"Friday, February 06, 2009\n\nPrime Rib, Method X, with Parsnips and Brussels Sprouts\n\n\nOh. My. Look at that!\n\nWe're not really \"beef roast\" people, usually opting for steaks instead. At least, we've tried roasting hunks of beef and it never gave us the same satisfaction. Except, of course, for prime rib. We've roasted prime rib at home several times before, and they were always delicious, even if we didn't always cook them perfectly.\n\nBut, of course, for such a huge hunk of beef and at its expense (I can barely get myself to buy it!), I thought we should come up with a fool-proof prime rib technique.\n\n\nMethod X\nI was going through my blog reader a while back and saw a post from Chef John of Food Wishes Video Recipes titled Perfect Prime Rib of Beef with the Mysterious \"Method X\".\n\nNeedless to say, I was very intrigued.\n\n(This was the same site from where I got the method for making Fried Green Tomatoes.)\n\nSo, what is Method X?\n\nMethod X is used for bone-in prime rib roasts that you want to cook to medium-rare. It works for any size. However, using boneless prime rib roasts has not been tested, nor has changing the doneness.\n\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nFirst thing, the prime rib roast must be brought to room temperature. 6 hours was the time allotted for this. However, we couldn't be home early enough for that, so I only had ours out on the counter for 2 hours or so (and hoped that it would be all right).\n\nFor seasoning, we simply did salt and pepper. Anything works.\n\nBefore putting the roast into the oven, I preheated the oven to 500F.\n\nNext, some math. See, one really does need math out of school!\n\nTake the weight of the hunk o' beef in pounds and multiply it by 5. Ours was 8 pounds, so the resulting number was 40.\n\nThis number is the number of minutes that the prime rib cooks for in the 500F oven. So, we put our prime rib roast into the oven and let it cook at 500F for 40 minutes.\n\nThen, after that time is up, one turns off the oven and does not open the oven door for 2 hours.\n\n\nAfter the 2 hours, pull out your meat. I don't even know if it needs to rest because essentially, it's been \"resting\" all this time. But, I let ours rest for a bit.\n\nWe wanted to keep the sides simple, so we roasted off some brussels sprouts and parsnips.\n\nOooh, parsnips!\n\nI've been a fan of parsnips ever since we bought them that very first time and roasted them alongside (or underneath, I should say) chicken and olives. They were so good, slightly sweet like that, with a hint of banana. I've been nagging JS to buy more parsnips... actually, to include them in our rotation of vegetables. But apparently, she says that they're actually \"expensive\" when compared to other vegetables. Oh well. [sigh]\n\nBack to the beef.\n\nAs you can see, the prime rib had a very nice crust. How about the interior? Well, as I was slicing the prime rib, I couldn't help but exclaim out loud with EACH slice: \"Ooooh! Wow! It's soooooo juicy!\"\n\nExclaim out loud.\n\nWith each slice.\n\nWe're Method X believers now. Of course, we would have to think of sides that don't need the oven. (Being us, though, we have no problems just having prime rib with rice.)\n\nThe video by Chef John of Food Wishes Video Recipes:\nPerfect Prime Rib of Beef with the Mysterious \"Method X\"\n\n\n  1. That prime rib looks perfect! And soooo simple. I wouldn't need anything else either.\n\n    I've never tried making it myself. Too expensive vs. too much worry about messing up an expensive cut of beef.\n\n  2. Wow! That looks great!! That Chef John sure is good, and quite handsome as well. I'm a big fan.\n\n  3. Holy Smokes! You cooked your prime rib PERFECTLY!\n\n    It seems like a lot of food... next time if you need an extra belly, you just let me know ;)\n\n  4. I like your style! You always go good meat and loads of vegetables :P\n\n  5. Wow!!! What a beautiful piece of meat... :)\n\n  6. Holy Frig. That looks awesome.\n    I've been somewhat intimidated by roasting...well that and I'm just one person....\n\n    You're first sentence was the first words out of my mouth when I saw that.\n\n    Awesome (the meat..the get the idea).\n\n\n  7. I'm salivating at the look of this Prime Rib...perfectly done.\n    You certainly make a good argument for trying this method out.\n\n  8. Oh that looks so perfect & you served it with two of my favorite winter vegetables! I should send you some parsnips, we get so much from the farm\n\n  9. I've never attempted a prime rib, but if I ever do, I'm using Method x!\n\n  10. That is a serious piece of meat. There is a talent to getting it right, and you definitely got it right on the money. Impressive! I have to try your method!\n\n  11. Exactly! I made my first Prime Rib 10 years ago and came across a similar method of preparation, high temp, turn it off, leave in the oven. It has turned out perfectly EVERY time, even the times when dinner guests ran two hours late. I just left it in the oven.....\n\n  12. Method X looks pretty awesome. This rare meat used to scare me in the past, but now I really love it!\n\n  13. this looks amazing. i'm really trying to cut down on my red meat intake, but when i see pieces like this, i really rethink y even bother!\n\n  14. do you know i've never, ever considered making prime rib at home. this post is getting me to seriously reconsider. it's perfectly cooked. and it doesn't need to remind us all of some rubbery, uber-fatty piece of $8.99 special at the local diner.\n\n  15. Ooh thanks! I'm going to try this. I love juicy medium rare meat! Yum!\n\n  16. Oh man that looks incredible! Thanks for sharing the \"method\". I've never tried making PR at home because 1) it seemed to complicated and 2) it doesn't come in 2 person sizes.\n\n    I think I just need to have a dinner party and invite people over.\n\n  17. Oh. My. God. That looks absolutely ravishing.\n\n    I have only once had prime rib (in a restaurant in rural Illinois) and that blew me away, but now I'm thinking this could be my next dinner party trick...\n\n  18. u roast it so perfectly, the way I like - pink in the center. I'm drooling now ;p\n\n  19. Wandering Chopsticks:\n    I know what you mean. It almost hurts to buy a prime rib roast. I try not to look at the price. ;)\n\n    Chef John:\n    Hahahaha. Entertaining, as always.\n\n    Hehe, thanks. =)\n\n    Yeah, I guess the being only one person is a good reason not to make prime rib at home. ;)\n\n    Peter M:\n    Lori Lynn:\n    Before trying it out, I was both optimistic and scared. I'm sold now.\n\n    Wow, \"SO MUCH PARSNIPS\"!!!\n\n    Ron Merlin:\n    Oh, that's good to know! (re leaving in the turned-off oven with no ill effects)\n\n    That medium rare meat was soooo juicy!\n\n    Haha... yeah. I know we're all supposed to eat more fruits and vegetables. But hey, this is an occasional splurge (both tummy-wise and wallet-wise).\n\n    we are never full:\n    Prime is the only \"roast\" I like, I think. Otherwise, I just got for a teak if I need a beef fix.\n\n    Jessica@Foodmayhem said...\n    Would love to hear how it turns out for you!\n\n    Marc @ NoRecipes:\n    Don't need a special reason to have a party at home, but the prime rib would be a good one! ;)\n\n    Oh man that looks incredible!\n\n    Yes, yes, make it, make it! (And really, only once?)\n\n    Drooling is always a good sign.\n\n  20. Dear Piece of Prime Rib,\n\n    You don't know me but I'm in love with you. It was salivate at first sight.\n\n    May I take you to dinner, if I pick you up at seven would you be rare, I mean ready?\n\n    Beautiful piece of meat!\n\n  21. Kathleen:\n    This is the bestest comment EVAR! ;)\n\n  22. I make prime year for my family ever year for Christmas, and the Method X method is the one I have ALWAYS used. It's stupid easy and it renders the most beautiful piece of meat you could ever imagine sinking your teeth into. Perfecto!\n\n  23. Anon:\n    I was quite happy to have discovered it as well! Mmm, prime rib!\n\n  24. Making this right now in 2016, with a 6-pounder from RCSS :)\n\n\nLinkWithin Related Stories Widget for Blogs",
