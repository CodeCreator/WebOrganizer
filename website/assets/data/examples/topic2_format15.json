This is understandable \u2013 the stored procs were complex and so Nettiers wouldn\u2019t have been able to guarantee the return type. Probably the earlier version of Nettiers was wrong to trust us in the first place. However *we* knew that it would always return the correct thing, and there were far too many places in the code to go back and recode it all to cope with a Dataset.\n\nIt seemed tricky to find the answer so I\u2019ve reposted it here from the original source (\n\nSet the Codesmith template setting AllowCustomProcMultipleResults (under the CRUD -Advanced section) to True and then regenerate. This seems to tell Nettiers to just trust that you know what you are doing, and sets the return type to that of the entity in the provider.",

        "text":"SQL Saturday Indianapolis: Everyone remembers their first time (recap)\n\nNote: If you attended my talk and you\u2019re looking for my code examples, you can find them over on GitHub. Also, please leave comments! I\u2019d love to hear what you thought.\n\nWay back when\n\nIn May of 2014,\u00a0I was seated in the main room of the Catalyst Ranch in Chicago, reviewing some findings of one of my production servers with Kendra Little. I was in town for one of Brent Ozar Unlimited\u2019s SQL Server Performance Troubleshooting classes, expanding my skill set. While she reviewed my troubled servers and provided insight, the conversation drifted over to how someone can get more involved with the SQL community. I mentioned to her that I wanted to start speaking at some point in the future.\n\n\u201cYou should!\u201d she said, enthusiastically. She then gave me a rundown of how to prepare topics, directed me to towards PASS, and wished me luck.\n\nFlash forward to this past Saturday\n\nAlmost a year and three months later, there I was: standing in front of a group of about 60 or so people. I was in Indianapolis for SQL Saturday #402 and this time, I was speaking. For me, this was a milestone: I am used to speaking locally to small-ish groups, but this was a huge\u00a0opportunity to take my contributions to the SQL community to the next level. When the session was all said and done, and the room applauded\u2026 I was overwhelmed, really. My feedback was all positive as well.\n\nTruth be told, I wasn\u2019t sure when or if I would have ever seen myself standing up there. I had made the decision earlier this year to make it a personal goal to go out and get involved in the greater SQL Server community; it started with registering my blog back in January of this year. From there, I sought out and obtained a board position on the local Columbus PASS chapter, spoke at the local chapter meeting a couple months ago, and helped plan and pull off a local SQL Saturday here in Columbus. It was like a whirlwind; I kept finding opportunities to get out there and volunteer and be part of the community the more and more I looked. And it\u2019s been such a blessing and journey and I can\u2019t wait to continue it.\n\nAs for my topic, PowerShell and SQL Server still is a tricky subject to teach. But I had some awesome people in attendance, such as Ben Miller, Pat Phalen, and David Maxwell who were there to give me great feedback on my session. Afterwards, Pat came up to me and told me about how when he presents he takes a \u201cReading Rainbow\u201d approach vs. \u201cA Sesame Street\u201d approach. When I asked what he meant, he said that a lot of speakers will focus on \u201chow\u201d to do something (Sesame Street), while he explains \u201cwhy\u201d you should be doing something (Reading Rainbow). And I\u2019d like to think that in my session, I took a similar stance. My goal wasn\u2019t to teach a room full of people how to use PowerShell; I can\u2019t do that in an hour. Instead, I wanted to show off demos and get people excited about what\u2019s possible with SQL Server and PowerShell. And in that, I think I succeeded. I had one attendee say that I convinced him. To me, there\u2019s no higher compliment.\n\nNobody is perfect\n\nThat said, I learned a lot this weekend. Both good and bad. Here\u2019s a quick run-down of things, in no particular order of importance:\n\n  1. My abstract needs work. While people were generally pleased with my session, I heard from more than one person that what I presented and how I presented it didn\u2019t match up well.\n  2. Every speaker is like a peer supporter. I had the pleasure of attending a lot of great sessions from a lot of great and well-known members of the community, but then they turned right around and attended me session. I was humbled, really.\n  3. Presenting on a Surface Pro 3 tablet is a pain in the butt. The extra resolution doesn\u2019t translate well to secondary \u201cmonitors\u201d when presenting.\n  4. No matter how hard you prepare, the mish-mash of resolutions of projectors will almost ensure that your demos won\u2019t look right. Best to get in the room as quick as you can and get set up.\n  5. I need to get better with ZoomIt for magnifying my screen when simple font size increases won\u2019t cut it.\n  6. There is a Chipotle in Richmond, Indiana. It\u2019s right about half-way between there and Columbus. Makes a great place to stop, in both directions.\n  7. Not enough people use twitter. The speakers all advocate it, but in my session and the others I attended, very few people raised their hands when asked if they were on twitter. They should be!\n\nAll told, this was an amazing weekend and experience for me. I can\u2019t wait to do it again in a couple weeks in Louisville. As for all the people I need to thank, no one needs more thanks than Hope Foley and the awesome Indy PASS crew for putting on a great event. I hope I was able to add the value they were looking for, because that was a fantastic event all around!",

        "text":"So\u2026 NPM doesn\u2019t care about intellectual property\u00a0rights?\n\nThe NPM organisation, a for-profit company, has just demonstrated that it doesn\u2019t care about the IP rights of contributors. As a organisation built entirely on the contributions of others, this is a worrying precedent.\n\n\nAzer Ko\u00e7ulu had developed and distributed, via NPM, a module called\nleft-pad. It\u2019s a simple library, consisting of 11 lines of code, that does what it says on the box \u2013 pads a string by adding spaces to the left.\n\nThis module then got picked up and used by lots of other modules. Apparently it had been downloaded nearly 2,500,000 times in the last month.\n\nKo\u00e7ulu had another module, called Kik. He received a cease-and-desist order from a lawyer complaining about trademark violation. He disputed that, and the lawyer then went to NPM. NPM decided to transfer the ownership of the Kik module \u2013 not remove it, but to assign ownership to a third-party.\n\nNot surprisingly, Ko\u00e7ulu was annoyed by this. So he yanked all of his modules \u2013 about 250 of them \u2013 from NPM. Including left-pad.\n\nThis broke lots of things \u2013 heaps of projects around the world started to see failures due to the missing dependency on left-pad. In many cases, these were secondary dependencies \u2013 where ProjectA breaks because it depends on ProjectB, which depends on left-pad.\n\nThere is no question that this is a messy situation. But the fix that NPM decided on was worse. They un-unpublished the most recent version of left-pad, apparently at the request of a new owner.\n\nWhat NPM should have done\n\nIt\u2019s fine that someone can claim the left-pad module \u2013 if it\u2019s been abandoned, it\u2019s up for grabs. Nothing particularly wrong with that.\n\nBut the new owner only gets access to the name \u2013 they don\u2019t suddenly get rights to the previously published code. Nor can NPM assign them the rights \u2013 by their own terms of service, they lose those rights when a module gets unpublished.\n\nThe new owner should have taken the couple of minutes it would have taken to fork the left-pad code base (which, under the WTFPL license used to distribute it, would have been perfectly fine), then packaged it up and submitted to NPM as a new module. They could even have re-used the version number, which would have solved everything.\n\nIn the case of Kik, NPM could have expelled the offending module. They could have claimed a safe-harbour provision and left it there. But they should not have assigned ownership to a third-party. And they really should not have double-downed on their transgression by doing it again.\n\n\nNPM does not care about the IP rights of its contributors. They have shown they are willing to transfer IP to third-parties, and even to transfer IP they\u2019ve explicitly had their rights to distribute removed.\n\nI would suggest not publishing anything to NPM.\n\nLessons learnt from a\u00a0bug\n\nThis is a rant about a bug report I raised with ExtJS a few weeks ago. That said, I\u2019m using the bug more as a teachable moment than anything else; I\u2019m certainly not trying to bag ExtJS (which I quite like, despite some of its quirks). But this bug does highlight a number of \u201cthings done wrong\u201d, which I want to learn from so that I don\u2019t commit the same errors.\n\n(No knowledge of ExtJS is required, and whilst I will describe the details of the bug in depth, the technical issues involved aren\u2019t meant to be the takeaway points)\n\nContinue reading \u201cLessons learnt from a\u00a0bug\u201d\n\nAnnoying issue with Javascript and\u00a0arrays\n\nStumbled across this one recently.

        "text":"\n\nHappy 2nd Birthday to Material Design In\u00a0XAML\n\nHappy 2nd Birthday!\n\nMaterial Design In XAML Toolkit Turns Two Years Old\n\nOn 1st February 2017 Material Design In XAML marks it\u2019s 2nd year since it appeared on GitHub. Right up front I have to apologise for all the bugs I haven\u2019t fixed. Plenty of people are helping out, but the project can only move so fast. I always try to prioritise API quality over cramming in more fixes and updates. Hopefully this shows, as I feel that on the whole the library is easy to use, robust, and ultimately helps make apps look great.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy, successful, and rewarding two years. Sometimes frustrating, always educational. I\u2019m continually dealing with users over email, Twitter, GitHub, Gitter; it\u2019s now got to the point where support is probably 75% of the time I spend on the project. Surely the biggest highlight for me was getting a Microsoft MVP award off the back of this work (and Dragablz), and traveling to Seattle for the MVP Summit. It was great to meet so many people I\u2019ve got to know on GitHub and Twitter.\n\nTwo years in I\u2019d like to share some stats on this project. .Net itself is undergoing major open source shakeup, with a big emphasis on the web\/ASP side of things. WPF is perhaps more of a \u201cniche\u201d tech, and may not be the bleeding edge XAML platform a anymore, but still has plenty of use, and the some of these stats illustrate the continuing popularity of WPF and the growing popularity of the toolkit:\n\n  \u2022 Nuget downloads: 84,839\n  \u2022 Average Nuget downloads per day: 118\n  \u2022 GitHub stars: 2,340\n  \u2022 GitHub forks: 4734\n  \u2022 GitHub average views per day: 1675\n  \u2022 GitHub average unique visitors per day: 319\n  \u2022 Website average unique visitors per day: 177\n  \u2022 Gitter chat room users: 300+ users\n\nTwo years ago, all these stats were a big fat zero. The trend has been upward ever since. I\u2019ve seen and supported students, enterprises and hobbyists use the toolkit to help bring modern styling, palettes and UX flow to their desktop apps, and there are now\ncontinually new projects appearing on GitHub referencing the library.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a monster JavaScript framework, and is much smaller than friend, and big-brother WPF project, MahApps. But it\u2019s healthy, and it\u2019s growing.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m focusing on \u201cdoobry\u201d, a NoSQL editor for Azure DocumentDb. I feel this is becoming a great example of how to utilise Material Design In XAML on the desktop to create useful, attractive apps. Obviously there will be more to come for the toolkit itself over the next 12 months.\n\n\nThanks to all the users, contributors and everyone who has supported the library over the last 2 years!\n\n(Birthday Cake from https:\/\/material.uplabs.com\/posts\/happy-birthday-icon\n\n.Net, Azure, DocumentDb, Uncategorized, WPF, xaml\n\nIntroducing \u201cdoobry\u201d for Azure\u00a0DocumentDb\n\nI\u2019ve been beavering away at a little website and decided \u2013 after a bit of investigation and then seeing Scott Guthrie talk at Azurecraft, London \u2013 to use DocumentDb for the data storage. \u00a0At that point I didn\u2019t have a massive amount of experience with NoSQL databases, but when I want to learn something I like to dive straight in, start coding, making mistakes, and hopefully come out the other side with some workable knowledge.\n\nThe website is\u00a0node.js based, and I found the initial setup of DocumentDb pretty straight forward after running the the tutorials. \u00a0I was up and running quickly, but I soon realised I wanted a tool for developing and testing queries, and playing around with my dev database. \u00a0The Azure portal isn\u2019t massively geared up for this. \u00a0I saw one application, but even in this web\/cloudy world I knew that with my arsenal of Material Design In XAML Toolkit and Dragablz libraries, I could throw together a desktop app to grease the gears\u00a0of developing the web app.\n\n\nYesterday I published the first full alpha release of that effort. \u00a0\u201cdoobry\u201d is simple to use, yet slick and pretty feature rich. \u00a0With it you can:\n\n  \u2022 Edit and run SQL queries\n  \u2022 Create, edit, copy and delete collection documents\n  \u2022 Work with multiple databases\n\n\nIt\u2019s open source, free to use, and an installer is available:\n\nIt\u2019s also a great showcase of all the things you can do with Material Design In XAML and Dragablz, utilizing features such as:\n\n  \u2022 Docking and layout persistance\n  \u2022 Advanced dialogs\n  \u2022 Transitions\n\nHopefully if you are using DocumentDb this tool will help you get along in your development and support tasks. \u00a0And if you are developing WPF Material Design\/Dragablz applications you might find some UX inspiration\u00a0and helpful XAML techniques within the source.\n\n.Net, C#, Design, Material Design, Uncategorized, UX, WPF, xaml\n\nSemVer, MVP and finally, Material Design In XAML\u00a02.0.\n\nThis release of Material Design In XAML has taken way longer than I hoped, and contains less than I had hoped, so I apologise for that. \u00a0I\u2019m trying to follow SemVer, and a couple of breaking changes meant it was time to tick over to v2. \u00a0Up until now I\u2019ve been keeping to small, regular releases, but knowing it was time to go to v2\u00a0I thought I\u2019d go for a big, showcase release. \u00a0I failed. \u00a0In assigned issues to the milestone I bit off way more than I could chew, even with the help of my\u00a0(awesome) contributors.\n\n\nI read\u00a0a tweet a while back saying someone couldn\u2019t trust an open source library as the versions had ticked up high; indicating API instability. \u00a0There\u2019s no doubt some truth in that, but in holding back a release (maybe so you can batch together several API changes) you start encountering the pitfalls of those longer release cycles. \u00a0Remember, that most open source projects are side projects, and time\u00a0can be in short supply. \u00a0To be honest, I became\u00a0a bit disheartened because I started realising I couldn\u2019t deliver everything I wanted in this release.\n\n\nSo, I decided to draw a line under what we\u2019ve got, roll the release, and get back to the shorter release cycles. \u00a0I try hard to keep the public surface of the library stable, but in the future, when it\u2019s time to move, I will move more quickly. \u00a0Even if it means ticking over SemVer more regularly.\n\n\nThe good news. \u00a0The release is still pretty awesome. \u00a0New Chip controls, new Toggle styled listboxes, and many other enhancements. \u00a0Also, I\u2019ve been privileged to receive a Microsoft MVP award for Windows Development. \u00a0I\u2019m pretty stoked about this, it\u2019s definitely nice to get some recognition for the open source journey I\u2019ve been on over the last few years. \u00a0A big thanks is owed to everyone that\u2019s helped this library grow and become something referenced in a lot of WPF systems.\n\nVersion 2.0 is now up on nuget. \u00a0Download and enjoy!\n\nThe full release notes are on GitHub.\n\n.Net, C#, coding, Design, Material Design, UX, WPF, xaml\n\nMaterial Design In XAML \u2013\u00a01.5\n\nIt\u2019s a big new release for MD in XAML Toolkit! This release focuses on a new transitions API (when I say API, I mean fully usable from XAML), which takes the pain out of WPF storyboard-ing, making animations on individual elements, and between whole \u201cpages\u201d easy.\n\nRelease page.\n\nTo showcase what can be done I\u2019ve created an entirely new demo app. What\u2019s great is that I was able to build version 1.0 of the demo app in less than a day. All the animations are \u201cout of the box\u201d; straight from Material Design In XAML Toolkit, with zero fiddling with WPF storyboards or animations (but yes, the extensibility is still there!)\n\nIt looks a bit like this:\n\n\nYou can get your hands on the new demo at it\u2019s new GitHub page.\n\nOn top of that there is also a small demo in the main Material Design In XAML Toolkit demo project.\n\nTo understand usage of the new transitions API, take a look at both demos and check out the wiki page.\n\nI say this every release, but it\u2019s always true, there have also been some great additions and fixes from the community (which is really growing nicely). \u00a0Full\u00a0release details are here.\n\nI guess with any software library it takes a while to gain traction, but\u00a0this library is now just over a year old, seems to have plenty of users and I\u2019m\u00a0seeing\u00a0some nice looking UIs appear. \u00a0With 1.5 I\u2019m hoping for some nice animation flourishes!\n\nHappy UXing!\n\n\nP.S.\u00a0n00b to Material Design In XAML Toolkit? \u00a0Check out the Getting Started guide.\n\n\nC#, Design, MahApps, Material Design, UI, UX, WPF, xaml\n\nIcon Pack \u2013 Material Design In XAML\u00a01.4\n\nNew for release 1.4 of Material Design In XAML Toolkit is a full icon pack. \u00a0Icon design is a skill itself and finding or creating good icons when designing an application can be a time consuming task. \u00a0 To help \u00a0in this regard I am\u00a0pleased to announce that the entire Material Design Icons\u00a0collection is now included in the library.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a \u00a0great collection, containing over 1,400\u00a0icons, including many of \u00a0the standard icons we see on Android phones and many more additional icons added by its own community. \u00a0 It\u2019s worthwhile heading over to the website to get an overview of the icons, and there\u2019s a search feature to help \u00a0you track down the icon you\u2019re after.\n\nUsing the icons in your WPF application is easy. \u00a0Assuming you\u2019ve already installed Material Design In XAML Toolkit,\u00a0the XAML is as simple\u00a0as:\n\n<materialDesign:PackIcon Kind=\"ShareVariant\" \/>\n\nTo give you:\u00a0share-variant-16.png\n\nThe icons are SVG based, so scale nicely:\n\n<materialDesign:PackIcon Kind=\"ThumbUp\" Height=\"24\" Width=\"24\" \/>\n<materialDesign:PackIcon Kind=\"ThumbUp\" Height=\"36\" Width=\"36\" \/>\n<materialDesign:PackIcon Kind=\"ThumbUp\" Height=\"48\" Width=\"48\" \/>\n\nthumb-up-24.png\u00a0\u00a0thumb-up-36.png\u00a0\u00a0thumb-up-48.png\n\nYou can see the entire icon collection in the main demo application:\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the base class for the icon has been added to ControlzEx (credit to @punker76 for this idea), so in the future you may well see MahApps use the same API for\u00a0Modern Design Language icons, giving WPF developers\u00a0a common, simple icon XAML syntax:\n\n<materialDesign:PackIcon Kind=\"SomeMaterialIcon\" \/>\n<mahApps:PackIcon Kind=\"SomeModernIcon\" \/>\n\nRelease Details\n\nVarious other fixes, enhancements, performance improveme...

        "text":"Sticky notes do not make Kanban\n\nI am often surprised to read or hear that many people think they are using a Kanban board when they stick notes on a wall. They say \u201cWe represent each stage of the process by a column and drive notes from left to right to represent work progress : a Kanban board.\u201d This is frequently the case with Scrum teams, and you can find plenty of articles on the Web entitled \u201cUsing a Kanban board to deal with impediments\u201d or saying things like \u201cThe main difference between a Scrum board and a Kanban board is that a Scrum board is reset after every sprint.\u201d I\u2019m sorry to\u00a0disappoint you but sticky notes do not make Kanban.\n\nThe main confusion is due to the fact that the sticky notes we use on the board are not kanban \u201ccards\u201d (or just kanbans). Indeed, the sticky notes are usually used to represent work items, tasks, user stories, etc. Those work items travel through the boar. On the contrary kanbans represent\u00a0the need to move work items. In a Toyota-like environment, they are messages meant to ask people before us on the process chain that we need them to refill the inventory, to produce more pieces.\n\nSo what about Kanban in software development then? Where are those famous kanbans if not the sticky notes? Let\u2019s take an example to make this clear : a Scrum team of 5 people, 1 of them is a tester, 4 are developers. To take advantage of everyone\u2019s\u00a0specialty, they decide to change the classical Scrum board and process ( to do \u2013 doing \u2013 done) into to do \u2013 dev \u2013 test \u2013 done.\n\nrevisited scrum board\n\nAfter a couple of sprints they notice a flaw with their process. Indeed, although everything goes fine most of the time, it happens that stories are easy and quick to develop, but hard to test. When this happens developers push many stories into the testing stage, the tester starts too many tests, plays too many scenarios at the same time and misses important defects, or cannot finish anything at all.\n\nDuring a sprint retrospective, the team reminds itself one of the most important things about Agile : work must be completed (or done or whatever you call it). They realize that they cannot let work pile up into the \u201ctest\u201d column and suggest several solutions. The first solution is to hire another tester, but this is impossible and would be unnecessary most of the time. The second is to implement a one-piece flow : the team swarms around a single item at a time, but it seems hard to implement and maybe a bit too extreme. Nevertheless the idea behind the one-piece flow looks good : limiting the work in progress to make sure that things are done.\u00a0We could say that the tester cannot test more than one item at a time while the 4 developers can develop 2 items at once, as we practice pair-programming, plus a small buffer to improve flexibility. But how to do that : if developers push items into the test column there will be more than one item at a time sometimes. The solution : a pull system. The resulting board looks like this:\n\nrevisited scrum board with kanban\n\nDevelopers will pull work from the TODO stage and the tester from the DEV DONE stage\u2026and this board is a kanban board.\n\nStill cannot see kanbans on this board? This is because kanbans are virtual.\u00a0Here are the the two main ingredients that make kanbans appear on the board:\n\n  \u2022 Focus on demand. The team has committed to providing a list of items during this sprint. To provide those items, they must be validated (the \u201ctest\u201d column). To be tested, items must be developed (the \u201cdev\u201d stage). This is what makes a kanban system be a pull system based on need. Kanbans represent this need. There is no work without a kanban.\n  \u2022 Limited-size inventory. To avoid piling up half-done work we need to limit WIP. Kanbans represent the availability of an empty slot to put a work item in.\n\nSo are you gonna tell us where those f***ing kanbans are? They are the difference between the WIP limits (aka the maximum size of the inventory) and the actual number of work items (aka the size of the inventory). We don\u2019t usually\u00a0represent them explicitly, but I have already seen boards on which WIP limits are not numbers but actual slots. What is important here is that kanban boards are not just about\u00a0visualizing work items, they are an impressive tool to visualize resource availability, help identifying bottlenecks, help manage risk, improve predictability, etc.\n\nIn short, a kanban board is not a board with sticky notes representing work items, it is a board where is represented a demand-focused pull-system with limited work-in-progress. Sticky notes are not required.\n\nEDIT (3 Jan 2013) :\u00a0Mike Burrows just posted a very good, very complete article on this subject here. He gives an interesting value-based introduction to Kanban instead of the classical sticky-notes-based description.\n\nOne thought on \u201cSticky notes do not make Kanban\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

        "text":"Tuesday, 9 August 2016\n\nImprovements to the Magic Darts Wagon Wheel\n\nyou may well have read my last post about what I was reluctantly calling a Magic Darts Wagon Wheel. If not, do that quickly now.\n\n\n\nAnyway, if you read all the way to the end and read the comments, you'll have seen a nice suggestion from Michael Bench-Capon, in which he proposes making the first dart in a bed contribute more opacity than later darts in a bed. And he even comes up with a way of doing this using fractions and powers of things (yes, mathematicians, that's a simplification!).\n\nAnyway, I thought this suggestion was excellent and I tried to implement it and the following few simple bullet points sum up what happened:\n  \u2022 I struggled for a bit, not really knowing exactly how to do it;\n  \u2022 I played around with some trial and error numbers;\n  \u2022 I thought of concocting a formula which meant that for a specified number of darts (based on number of legs to win, like I initially had), you would reach 95% opacity;\n  \u2022 I came up with something like 0.05 = n^x, where n is my parameter to be defined and x is my specified number of darts;\n  \u2022 it's 0.05 transparency because opacity is one minus transparency;\n  \u2022 I want to find n so I needed the xth root of 0.05\n  \u2022 I realised that I didn't know how to find an xth root of something so I googled it and it turns out you just do ^1\/x, which is very handy;\n  \u2022 so I came out with something like 0.05^(1-\/x) as my n;\n  \u2022 I then substitute what I used to have as my number of darts for maximum transparency depending on bed type for x, so e.g. it's twice legs to win for missed doubles;\n  \u2022 this gives me a paramter for each bed type which I called z;\n  \u2022 then to generate the transparency I just need z^y, where y is the number of darts in the bed;\n  \u2022 UPDATE: And this actually really helped tidy up the code as well because I could get rid of a \"case\" thingy I had in there which I had needed to check if the max no. of darts had been exceeded and just go to a super simple transparency = z^y;\n  \u2022 happy days.\nThis is the result, using this match between Canada and New Zealand.\n\nI think this really does create a better overall animation than with the previous method, though of course I'm still at a very early testing phase. Still fone-tuning, if you will. Thanks again though to my contributer and please everyone feel free to comment etc. and make further excellent suggestions. Half-hearted remarks or even exclamations would also be appreciated.\n\nPS: I'm also still on the lookout for new name suggestions. Still not wholly happy with Magic Darts Wagon Wheel.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Friday, 11 September 2015\n\n\u201cThink-Build-Run\u201d - and Insource or Outsource?\n\nFor some people the concept of splitting an IT function into logical components of \u201cThink\u201d (or \u201cPlan\u201d), \u201cBuild\u201d and \u201cRun\u201d will be nothing more than a fashion statement. There will also be those who are, for personal or philosophical reasons, totally opposed to the concept. For many, especially where the IT function is small, achieving such a delineation may be impossible given an absence of critical mass in one or all areas.\u00a0\nYet for others, \u201cThink - Build - Run\u201d will be a logical move, allowing a sharper degree of focus for them, their people, and their business; giving them the chance to drive up quality and drive down cost. It will be, more or less, the IT equivalent of an efficient production line paralleled with some kind of interpretation of \u2018Lean\u2019. For these people, likely to be in larger organisations with larger IT functions, it might simply be \u2018the right thing to do\u2019.\nFor those that adopt T-B-R, there is often a follow-on question when looking at the organisational shift to the new model: Insource or Outsource? Whilst this question is, for CEOs and CIOs always there in the background anyway, T-B-R can throw it further into the spotlight, especially if there is a working assumption that the \u201cRun\u201d part is more or less akin to commoditised computing services. And make no mistake, much of it is. But there is a danger in falling for a too simplistic view of the world. Many people might draw an equation between T-B-R and Insource\/Outsource in the following way:\n\nBut not only is this a lazy interpretation, it is also flawed. The true line of transformation we should be looking at is something like this:\n\nAnd why is that?\n1 - Because you should never outsource very much of your \u201cThink\u201d activity. This is the area where you are closer to the business, where the relationships between IT and its Customers are most critical, and where in-house expertise can add the most value. If you can truly add differentiating competitive advantage to your organisation as an IT function, then in \u201cThink\u201d is where you will do so.\n2 - Because, whether we like it or not, a large proportion of the \u2018systems\u2019 IT functions \u201cBuild\u201d is likely to be unique to that organisation. Either they are bespoke, one-off solutions, or they are customised versions of commercial software offerings - and sometimes very customised! (And don\u2019t forget all the Excel Warriors..!) It is only when you start to get to homogenous, non-differentiating, more \u2018vanilla\u2019 kinds of solution that a greater degree of outsourcing begins to make more sense (and Software as a Service [SaaS] can play a role here).\n3 - Because you should never outsource all of \u201cRun\u201d. Even if it is only the management layer that you retain, responsibility for the service still resides in-house, and CIOs need people on their teams who hold that passion and accountability. Again the question of the service being truly commoditised comes to the fore, as do things like scale, practicality etc. There are some elements of \u201cRun\u201d that you simply will not be able to do as well as a third party provider (or at all, come to that: think of networks\u2026), but there may be others where there is enough local differentiation to suggest that keeping it in-house just makes sense.\nOf course, other factors come into the equation such as cost differentials and arbitrage, the overall size and philosophy of the company as a whole, appetite, previous experience, in-house expertise and talent, and so on. And the feast is a moving one too, with \u2018Cloud\u2019 becoming ever more mature, and the whole notion of Bimodal \u2019Mode 1\u2019 \/ \u2018Mode 2\u2019 projects adding another new dimension to the mix.\n\nInevitably the equation is a very complex one, and to which the solution is rarely simple.\n\nSunday, 6 September 2015\n\nBeing Agile...\n\nFashion is everywhere. Fashion introduces new things to us - and recycles the old! Fashion creates product and demand; it generates sales and profit; it breeds need. Even in Information Technology, we love fashion. It gives us the opportunity to create new notions and processes; it is a natural bedfellow with the rapid changes in technology that we are now seeing, inventing new ways to use those technologies and creating new \u2018products\u2019 from them.\nYet what we actually do in IT is the same as ever: we teach machines (computers, now of various favours including mobile phones) to take the data we give them and then manipulate and store that data for future processing (more manipulation) or reporting. Occasionally the data is used to control other things, like traffic lights or machinery - or even spaceships and cars!\u00a0\nEnsuring that we do a good job in building the systems that make those manipulations effective, IT professionals have always invented rules and processes around the development cycle in order to try and make the end product as good as it can be. As technology moves on and the pace with which development can be carried out quickens, the volume of changes and the speed with which results are needed both increase, and hence new models of development are needed.\nAnd so we have seen a progression of methodologies like \u2018waterfall\u2019 through \u2018rapid application development (RAD)\u2019 and on to \u2018Agile\u2019, the current IT panacea for this decade it seems.\nAgile\u00a0software\u00a0development\u00a0is a group of software\u00a0development\u00a0methods in which solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary\u00a0development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change. (Wikipedia)\nLike many \u2018next great things\u2019, Agile will only be as good as the people and organisations that adopt it However, we might be missing a trick here. Should \u2018Agile\u2019 not be a state of mind, a philosophy, rather than a methodology or series of formal IT processes? For one thing, if a development team is working in \u2018an agile way\u2019 but the rest of IT is not, or the culture of the business as a whole is slow and ponderous, will \u2018Agile\u2019 not inevitably fail to deliver as much as it might promise to?\nTake the Wikipedia definition above. The \u201ccollaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams\u201d requires\u00a0everyone\u00a0involved to be able to work in the same way. \u201cRapid and flexible response to change\u201d needs to be in the DNA or culture of the whole organisation; what\u2019s the point in producing IT systems quickly if their prospective users do not readily embrace change?\nIf we think of being \u2018Agile\u2019 as being \u201cthe answer\u201d and that it relates just to IT software development, then we are deluding ourselves. \u2018Agile\u2019 needs to be part of the corporate culture.\nAgile\u00a0is a\u00a0cultural philosophy\u00a0as a result of which\u00a0decisionsactions\u00a0and\u00a0business solutions\u00a0evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive\u00a0planning, evolutionary and incremental\u00a0progress, early\u00a0delivery, continuous\u00a0improvement\u00a0and the\u00a0elimination of waste\u00a0(in all its forms), effective and prompt\u00a0decision-making, and encourages a rapid and flexible response to\u00a0change.\nOK, I know this version isn\u2019t perfect - but doesn\u2019t it sound much more like the kind of business we would all like to work in?! Isn\u2019t it more inclusive and relevant to\u00a0all\u00a0our staff, rather than that minor percentage employed in the rarified world of IT application development? Yes, it might increase risk a little; and yes, it will demand better delegation, more accountability and so forth. But in the end, those are probably good things - and any negatives should be outweighed by overall commercial benefits.\nAnd I expect each of us can think of real, every-day examples of where being \u2018Agile\u2019 can bring true improvement - in bottom-line, morale, responsiveness etc.\nWhy not change the format and content of that monthly departmental meeting so that we can focus on just the critical points and get through it in an hour instead of the four hours it currently takes?\nWhy not reduce the number of people needed to take a decision to those who are\u00a0really\u00a0affected by it so that the decision is made more\u00a0quickly? And why not make decisions when a) you have 80% of the data needed rather than search for the 100%, or b) when everyone\u00a0knows\u00a0what the \u2018right\u2019 answer is anyway?!\nWhy not redesign our organisations to facilitate teams whose\u00a0sole\u00a0purpose is rapid response or firefighting?\nWhy not cull the hundreds of documents and reports we produce and focus on the very few we actually\u00a0need?\nWhy not, why not\u2026\nAgile as a software development methodology is all well and good, but until we broaden our thinking to embrace more than just IT, we will never get the full potential benefit of taking such a pragmatic approach.\nAbout the author \/ copyright\nThis material (text and photograph) is copyright of Ian Gouge \u00a9 2015.

        "text":"I came to Microsoft 8 years ago, happy but a little frightened about a salaried job, happy not to be travleing, and most of all, amazed that I got paid to beat on new technology and make it break, but my goal was to eventually be a developer here. I always loved building software for myself, and testing it would be a great way to get in the door, but eventually, I knew that I'd want to make the jump to development.\n\nYet here it is, 8 years later, and I'm a test manager. Why? Well, it wasn't an accident.\n\nSee, after about 2 years working with my Program Management and Development counterparts, I had an epiphany of sorts. I loved what I was doing; I mean I really loved my job. I was writing code, lots of it, as much as I wanted. My job was writing the code that tested the code we shipped. I got to be PM, Dev, and QA all in one over all the test code. Plus I got all the opportunities I could ask for in impacting the features we shipped. And as a Test Engineer, I'd written tons of specifications and dramatically impacted the shape of the features just by using the thing and giving my opinions, and by leaving the implementation details up to someone else, I was broadening my scope of influence. I'd even been asked to write shipping code a time or two because I was the last remaining expert on an existing code base.\n\nSo back to my epiphany. I realized that my job could be whatever I wanted it to be. If I took the narrow vision of a software test engineer or software design engineer in test's job and boxed myself into a job description, then perhaps I would have moved to development. But I realized that the job description is just a minimum bar; it's the stuff that has to get done to ship. But here is an employer that wants employees to go above and beyond. No, that's not quite right, Microsoft actively encourages them to do so; in fact, the entire compensation system is based upon you doing more than just 'your job'. I had the freedom to make my job more than just what was in the job description. You have great ideas, you have a strong vision and are willing to stick your neck out a bit (and not afraid to be wrong from time to time because your coworkers will let you know in no uncertain terms that you are wrong), the sky is really the limit.\n\nSo you're saying, Adam, that's great, but why is it that test can expand their job beyond their job scope, but dev and pm can't? Well, they can, but it's not as in sync with what they are already doing, so it's a tougher battle. For Dev, they have to get so technically deep in one area to code the features that they struggle stepping back to see the 'forest for all the trees' in most cases. When they can do this, typically the don't spend too long as a developer. They move to PM or to a Dev Lead. There's a well known saying at microsoft; if you want to know how a product works, ask a tester on the team. And it's mostly true. Dev generally know the feature the coded really well, but rarely step back and see how it integrates into the whole. And they are generally quite arrogant about it. Think I'm wrong? Check out this post by Jon Avner\n\nPM, well, if you get PM to actually install the product, they could tell you how it was supposed to work when they wrote the spec. OK, so I am being a bit facetious; I have worked with some great PMs who were the first people to check a bug on the product when it came in. But largely, during the milestone while dev and test are coding, they have moved on beyond what's being coded and working on the next set of specs; using the product day to day and challenging the ideas they already put down on paper and got everyone to agree to is probably an akward step for them.\n\nSo, OK, Adam, I get that QA can have a broad impact, gets to write lots of code, and get's paid to poke holes in other peoples code! So why Microsoft?\n\nChallenges abound. Just working at Microsoft is challenging; but working with some of the brightest people in the world every day is invigorating and fulfulling as much as it is challenging. For me in my current role, building and driving a QA organization and the entire product unit to stand for quality in every respect is both challenging and rewarding.\n\nSo I could work for lots of companies, but Microsoft is different. Here they encourage me to go above and beyond. While I've spent my entire career in developer tools, I have an impact on the quality of Office and Windows. I could move to games or portable devices, or tablet, or exchange or sql server and have a rewarding experience in any of those groups. The opportunities for moving between organizations to become reinvigorated by a product, well, I don't think there's anywhere in the world quite like Microsoft.\n\nSo here I am, 8 years later, doing my QA job, and still at Microsoft. And I wouldn't want it any other way.",

        "text":"Search This Blog\n\nMonday, October 15, 2012\n\nMZ-Tools for VBA and VB6\n\nMZ-Tools is a terrific tool for anybody serious in getting some code done in Excel VBA and VB6.\n\nPress here to download this free tool MZ-tools\n\nWith this tool is much easier to document your code and speed up some repetivie tasks.\nThe tools I use most often are\n\n1) Insert and Remove line numbers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is very usefull if you want to add the line number at which an error occurs with the Erl functions\n\n2) Add Module Header. This is the the snipped I use\n\n' Module    : {MODULE_NAME}\n' Author    : {AUTHOR}\n' Date      : {DATE}\n' Purpose   : \n\nOption Explicit\n\nPrivate Const cMODULE_NAME As String = \"{MODULE_NAME}\"\n\n3) Add Procedure Header\n\n' Procedure : {PROCEDURE_NAME}\n' Author    : {AUTHOR}\n' Date      : {DATE}\n' Purpose   : \n' Inputs    :\n' Output    :\n\n4) Error Handler\n\n    Const cPROC_NAME As String = \"{PROCEDURE_NAME}()\"\n\nOn Error GoTo ErrorHandler\n\n\n\n    Call ErrorHandler.Log(cMODULE_NAME, cPROC_NAME, Err.description,)\n\nAll those code snippets must be added in the option... dialog box of the MZ-Tools add-in.\n\nHavin a module header and a procedure header for each module and procedure that you write will greatly enhance code maintainance.\n\nIn addition I have also and Error Handling snippet. This use my ErrorHandler module.\nThe ErroHandler module is a piece of code I wrote to manage in a coherent way the error raised by an application.\n\nProperty Set, Let, Get\n\nIn VBA when we define the properties of an object we have a Let, Set and Get operators.\nWe use the Get operator to retrieve the value of a property\nWhe use the Set operator to set the value of an Object\nWe use the Let operator to set the value of a variable (not an object : string, double, enumeration...)\n\nThe use of the Set operator, force you to use the Set function when setting the value of an object property of type object.\n\nOption Explicit\n\nPrivate Const cMODULE_NAME As String = \"House\"\nPrivate mAddress As String\nPrivate mDoors As Collection\n\nPublic Property Get Address() As String\n   Address = mAddress\nEnd Property\n\nPublic Property Let Address(value As String)\n   mAddress = value\nEnd Property\n\nPublic Property Get Doors() As Collection\n   Set Doors = mDoors\nEnd Property\n\nPublic Property Set Doors(value As Collection)\n   Set mDoors = value\nEnd Property\n\nButtons and spreadsheet duplicaton with Excel VBA\n\nIf you want to add Button on an excel spreadsheet you have two choice\n\n1) Active-x buttons\n2) Form buttons\n\nI you plan to duplicate a spreadsheet whic contains buttons using VBA Code, than you must use\nForm buttons not Active-x ones.\nIf you use Active-x buttions you might get a VBA run time errors, which now on top of my head I don't rememeber.\n\nSo the tip here is\nUse Form buttons if you plan to duplicat using VBA code to duplicate excel spread-sheets that contains them.\n\nUsing implements behind an Excel worksheet function\n\nSince an excel worksheet is represented by a class module in vba, you might be tempted, as I was, to use the implements keywords behind a worksheet.\nThis would allow you to use polymorphically an Excel worksheet and could open-up differ possibilities.\nHowev this is my advice\n\n\nI have noticed that despites the code compiles, the overall worksheet becomes unstable and tend to crash!\nIn additon the TypeOf function applied to the worksheet object that use the implements keyword, does not always\u00a0behaves\u00a0as you would expect.\nif you write on top of an excel worksheet module\n\nImplements IEngine\n\nSome time the test TypeOf sht is IEngine will return false even if it is implementing the interface.\n\nStrongly typed dictionary collection in VBA\n\nIn this post, I will show you how to build a strongly type dictionary and how to loop through its elements with a For Each Loop.\n\nThe Generic Dictionary Object can be found in the \"Microsoft Scripting Runtime\" library.\nThis can be used to store any type of variables or object. However, it is usually\u00a0very useful to wrap it up so that you can create your own strongly typed dictionary.\nAs you will see from the code below, a very simple way to loop through the collection of elements in a dictionary is to loop through its keys. The variable key\u00a0must be variant type.\nFor Each key In emps.Keys\n   Set emp = emps(key)\n   Debug.Print emp.Name\n\nThe first class is a strongly typed dictionary of Employee object, called Employees.\nA usual to make the .Item property to be the default property you need to add the\n\nAttribute Item.VB_UserMmeId = 0\n\njust below the definition of the Get Item property\n\nOption Explicit\n\nPrivate Const cMODULE_NAME As String = \"Employees\"Private mDic As Dictionary\n\nPrivate Sub Class_Initialize()\n  Set mDic = New Dictionary\nEnd Sub\nPrivate Sub Class_Terminate()\n  Set mDic = Nothing\nEnd Sub\n\nPublic Sub Add(key As Variant, Item As Employee)\n    Call mDic.Add(key, Item)\nEnd Sub\n\nPublic Property Get Item(key As Variant) As Employee\n   'Attribute Item.VB_UserMemId = 0\n   'This Attribute makes Item the default property\n   'In VBA, uncomment the first line. Export, Remove and import the file again. To make it work\n\n   Set Item = mDic.Item(key)\nEnd Property\n\nPublic Function count() As Long\n   count = mDic.count\nEnd Function\n\nPublic Function Exists(key As Variant) As Boolean\n  Exists = mDic.Exists(key)\nEnd Function\n\nPublic Function items() As Variant\n items = mDic.items\nEnd Function\n\nPublic Function Remove(key As Variant)\n  mDic.Remove (key)\nEnd Function\n\nPublic Function RemoveAll()\nEnd Function\n\nPublic Function Keys() As Variant\n  Keys = mDic.Keys\nEnd Function\n\nThis is\u00a0the the Employee Class\n\nOption Explicit\n\nPrivate Const cMODULE_NAME As String = \"Employee\"\nPrivate mIdentifier As Long\nPrivate mName As String\nPrivate mAge As Long\n\nPublic Property Get Identifier() As Long\n  Identifier = mIdentifier\nEnd Property\n\nPublic Property Let Identifier(value As Long)\n    mIdentifier = value\nEnd Property\n\nPublic Property Get Name() As String\n   Name = mName\nEnd Property\n\nPublic Property Let Name(value As String)\n   mName = value\nEnd Property\n\nPublic Property Get Age() As Long\n  Age = mAge\nEnd Property\n\nPublic Property Let Age(value As Long)\n  mAge = value\nEnd Property\n\nThis is the Sub to test the Code\n\nSub TestCollection()\n\nDim emp As Employee\nDim emps As Employees\nDim key As VariantSet emps = New Employees\nSet emp = New Employee\nemp.Identifier = 1\nemp.Name = \"Mario\"\nemp.Age = 34\nCall emps.Add(emp.Identifier, emp)\n\nSet emp = New Employee\nemp.Identifier = 2\nemp.Name = \"Gino\"\nemp.Age = 12\nCall emps.Add(emp.Identifier, emp)\n\nFor Each key In emps.Keys\n   Set emp = emps(key)\n   Debug.Print emp.Name\nNextEnd Sub\n\nEnviron. A useful function to get environment infos\n\nThe Environ function is a pretty useful VBA function that gives you back many important info about the pc.\nIf you copy and paste this code snippet, you will see in the immediate window the full list of parameter to use and what they return.\n\nOne of the most useful are\n\n\nPublic Sub EnvironParameters()\n    Dim nCount As Integer\n    nCount = 0\n    nCount = nCount + 1\n    Do Until Environ(nCount) = \"\"\n        Debug.Print Environ(nCount)\n        nCount = nCount + 1\n\nEnd Sub\n\nThis is the complete list of parameters\n\n\n\nThursday, August 16, 2012\n\nVB6 IsMissing() and optional arguments\n\nIn\u00a0VB6\/VBA the IsMissing function\u00a0is used to test for optional arguments passed to user-defined function procedures as variants. Default values were not required for optional arguments; if no value was passed then IsMissing returned true. It was also possible to specify a default value of a primitive type to pass to the Variant argument.\n\nThe important point is that IsMissing only work for optional argurment of Variant Type.\nIf the optional argument is not of variant type, you should not use the IsMissing() function.\nIn this case always supply a default value, even if the compiler does not require it.\n\nMonday, August 13, 2012\n\nVBA \/ VB6 Interface implementation\n\nFew months ago I blogged about interface implementation in VB6. You can find the post here\nHowever, I discovered that the code had a memory leak caused by a circulare reference.\nYou can find a solution here.\n\nThe Keyword Implements in VBA\/VB6 allows you to do Interface Implementation, which in turns allows for Polymorphism. This is indeed a great capability of the VB6 language that is often overlooked.\nWhile the VB6 version of interface implementation is not so elegant as the one from .NET environment, it still allows you to implement most of the pattern of the GoF books\nI will show you a very easy example on how to use it in VBA.\nThe Idea is to create an interface called IInstrumet with just one property \"Id\", and have a Security class that implements its interface. You could also have a Fund, Porftolio or a Security Class that implements this interface. This wil allow for polymorphism.\n\nDim inst as IInstrument\nDim sec as Security\nDim fn as Fund\n\nSet sec = new Security\nSet fn = new Fund\n\nSet inst = sec\nSet inst = fn\n\nAs you can see, bot a security and a fund can be assigned to an Instruments object!\nWe first define a Class called IInstrument. The code is here\n\n'This is an Interface for the Generic Financial Instrument\n\nPublic Property Get Id() As String\n'Only Signature\nEnd Property\n\nPublic Property Let Id(value As String)\n'Only Signature\nEnd Property\n\nWe now create a new Class called Security that Implements the IInstrument one. This is a bit more tricky.\nOnce we implement an Interface, the Class that implements it in VB6 will declare those method as Private like that.\n\nPrivate Property Get IInstrument_Id() As String\n\u00a0\u00a0 IInstrument_Id = mId\nEnd Property\n\nThis is a kind of unsual behaviour, because if I know that the Security class implements the IInstrument interface, I expect to have access to the same methods and property made available by the interface obejcts. For this reason, I usually expose as public member the same properties and functions that are available in the interface. When I implement them, I delegate the job to the interface method\n\n3) I i... (truncated)",

        "text":"Things to keep in mind while designing User\u00a0Interface\n\nHi Guys!\n\nThis is my first post so not writing anything too heavy!!!\n\nSo, we are going to see things to follow while designing webpages.\n\nBasically the website we design need to be user friendly and easy to understand to any kind of user.\nToday i am writing only about Sign Up.\n\nOn the Opening of the site that is home page of the site, try to make the sign up button more effective and more attention grabbing. Try to write FREE in bold so that gets the user attention easily. Once the user clicks on it he is all yours.\n\nWhile designing a Sign Up page for any kind of site, you must keep it as simple as you can to get more customers.\nOn the sign Up page don\u2019t ask the user too much of information for logging in.\nkeep minimum questions like\n\nFirst Name,\nLast Name,\n& Password.\n\nOnce the User is logged in then you can ask him to update his profile with the remaining questions you want to ask.\n\nThanks for reading\u2026. \ud83d\ude42\n\nRaspberry Pi based Content Delivery\u00a0Platform\n\n\nThe Raspberry Pi is a credit-card-sized single-board computer developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools. The Raspberry Pi has a Broadcom BCM2835 system on a chip (SoC), which includes an ARM1176JZF-S 700 MHz processor (The firmware includes a number of \u201cTurbo\u201d modes so that the user can attempt overclocking, up to 1 GHz, without affecting the warranty),VideoCore IV GPU, and was originally shipped with 256 megabytes of RAM, later upgraded to 512MB. It does not include a built-in hard disk or solid-state drive, but uses an SD card for booting and long-term storage. The Foundation\u2019s goal is to offer two versions, priced at US$25 and US$35\n\nContent Delivery Solution\n\nLets see how a Raspberry pi based content delivery solution can be developed for educational institutes or anyone who needs it. Educational institutes have primary objective to enable learning through various interactive programmable delivery of content. The setup can be installed in lounge areas or even in school classrooms. Content can be customized as per need and pre-added to a batch file based application that functions like a jukebox that open the YouTube video link using the default internet browser. Making the content delivery changes will be a custom requirement and can be remotely administered. The prototype application can be administered by modifying the configuration files that directly download content from LAN or any other source.\n\nHow can it be done ? \u2013 The Technology\n\nFreeBSD \u00a0installed on the sd card and Apache based web application for each school\/university as per need.

Hence to reach an agile-able state there are a lots of prerequisites that need to understood and documented before the Agile sprint can be started:\n\nHere is a process diagram that can be implemented to enable the rapid application development.\n\n\nAs you see that there are input documents for each phase of software development. Before the project starts most important being the Requirement Analysis. Requirement analysis accurately documents all necessary features in details and functionality desired. In web applications this is not enough because additionally a visual design is necessary to create how the app will actually be used by end user. The mock-up of all the pages and visual design gives a clear flow of the app.\n\nBased on the visual design and requirements documentation its now possible to create a Product Test Plan. This test plan is actually used by the Tester\/QA to start with Test Case development. As shown the Tester\/QA engineer develops the Use Case document so all Test scenarios can be developed. All these documents are input documents for Detailed Technical Design document.\n\nA detailed technical document is then reviewed and approved by all stakeholders. An Agile Scrum master is now ready to take this forward since all the detailed technical design and the tasks can be identified. Scrum Master then proceeds with a 10 day sprint cycle and delivers a demo at end of each sprint.\n\nHow to Insert dynamic data using Node.js, Express.js, Angular.js and\u00a0MongoDB?\n\nFirst, we have to install and configure NodeJS and mongoDB.\nInstalling NodeJs on windows:\nInstall it from :\nConfirm that Node is running correctly:\nHere are some steps to make sure that Node is running correctly.\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Create helloNode.js file\nvar http=require(\u2018htttp\u2019);\nres.end(\u201cHello world\u201d);\nconsole.log(\u2018server is running on port:3000\u2019);\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Run it through command prompt.\n\u00a0F:\\sonika\\config\\node helloNode.js\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0server is running on port:3000\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Open browser and type URL: http:\/\/localhost:3000\/\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The output will be:\nHello world\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Now,your node is running correctly.\nConfiguring\u00a0 MongoDB :\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Download zip file\u00a0 from this link:\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Unzip it and Put it in particular directory.\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Create \u2018data\\db\u2019 folders in that directory to store our data(we can give any name to that folder).\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Go to that directory\u2019s lib folder and run it\u00a0 for that go through following command.\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0F:\\Sonika\\All Data\\software\\mongodb\\bin>mongod.exe\u00a0 \u2013dbpath\u00a0 F:\\Sonika\\All \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Data\\software\\mongodb\\data\\db\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Press \u2018Enter\u2019.\n\n\u2981 It will look like this,\n\n\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Now,your MongoDB is ready to store data.\nNow, lets develop an Student Registration form sample application\nFor that, we have to follow some steps:-\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Create directory structure.\n\n\u2981\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Create package.json file.\nThis text file contains all the information about the project,\nlike project path,dependencies, author name, tags, bug tracking info\u00a0 etc..\nTo create a package.json run npm init command from the root folder.\nIt will ask seri...
