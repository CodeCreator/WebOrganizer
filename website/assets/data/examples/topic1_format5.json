Did you mean to use \"continue 2\"? in \/homepages\/44\/d96953007\/htdocs\/vincent\/wp-content\/themes\/jupiter\/framework\/includes\/minify\/src\/Minifier.php on line 227\nFAQ \u2013 VincentDavidJohnson.com\n\n\nMy entire website had a database issue and when it was restored, this is one of the few pages that has lost it functionality. Please forgive me while I try to correct the problem.\n\nIf you have any specific questions, feel free to reach out via email, phone, or direct message on social media.\n\nAm I available on a specific date?\n\nI do not publicly display days that I am booked\/available, so the only way to find out is to ask. For example I wasn\u2019t booked for one of the most popular wedding dates in the last twenty years \u201c7\/7\/07\u201d, however I had almost 20 requests for \u201c6\/7\/08\u201d alone after I was booked. For date requests and other information email me through the Connect page, or directly at\u00a0\u00a0vincent [dot] johnson [at] othervertical [dot] com .\n\nDo you shoot \u201cphotojournalistic\u201d style\n\n\u201cPhotojournalistic Style\u201d seems to be the \u201cit\u201d word, these days in the wedding photography world. The fact is; \u201cPhotojournalism\u201d is a profession, not a photographic style. My style is my style and my job as the photographer at your wedding is to document that moment in your life. Portfolios are a great way of figuring out a photographers style. I always suggest that not only do you check out my wedding portfolio, but also my other work and the non-wedding work of any other photographer you might be looking at. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find their style.\nFor more on my take on \u201cPhotojournalistic\u201d wedding photography & other things related to wedding photography, check out my Blog\u00a0\n\nHow many images do you normally take?\n\nFor an average 8 hour wedding I shoot between 1,500 & 2,000 images.\n\nWhat should I included in my initial contact with you to get a wedding photography quote?\n\nThe majority of my wedding photography quotes are customized to the couple, so it\u2019s very rare that I give an exact quote after an initial email. The starting rate for a weekend wedding (Fri-Sun) is $1,700.\u00a0Info to include; date, city, expected photography time start to finish, any pre-or-post portraits sessions you want, albums\/prints products you\u2019re interested in, & whether you want a 2nd photographer, or video.\n\nDo I have to pay for everything before the wedding?\n\nNo. A retainer equal to 50% of your package, is due in 2 months from the signing of the contract, never more than $1,000. The final amount due, must be paid in full on, or before the wedding day. Album payments (except prepaid discounts) are due when the order is placed.\n\nWhy are you less expensive than other photographers & studios?\n\nThe answer is kind of simple, I don\u2019t just photograph weddings. I\u2019m busy year round doing commercial photography & photojournalism and not just working during peak wedding season. Being a professional photographer for over 20 years, means many of my clients find me by word of mouth. On top of that most of my photographic work is done on location, or in my in-home studio. Add it all up and you\u2019re paying for the photos and not my advertising and rent expenses.\u00a0\n\nWhy are you more expensive than other photographers & studios?\n\nSince the advent of the digital camera the number of people who claim photography as a hobby has increased. The sad part is, quite a few wedding photographers, be it independent, or studio hired, are nothing more than weekend shutterbugs looking to supplement their regular income. It\u2019s simply supply & demand, there is a demand for saving money on wedding expenses & there is a supply of inexperienced photographers willing to make just a couple of hundred dollars a few weekends a year. My advice, if you find one of these photographers, ask them what they do during the week? If it isn\u2019t photography, buyer be ware.\n\nWill you travel?\n\nYes, whether it\u2019s driving to a location in the Midwest, or anywhere my passport will get me, I\u2019m open to traveling to shoot your wedding. In most cases the only additional costs occur when the location is over a 2 hours drive from Chicago, in the form of flight & hotel expenses.\u00a0 I generally requests at least a two night stay, a full day ahead to arrive before the ceremony, this helps make up for possible flight delays, and then night of the wedding. If I hang out longer that\u2019s on my dime.\n\nWhat do you charge to travel?\n\nI like to travel, so my travel expenses can be covered at cost, either by you directly (booking hotel & airfare), or included in the deposit.\u00a0 I don\u2019t expect first class air & a room at the Ritz, but unless the wedding is in the jungle, I don\u2019t expect Pond Hopper Air & a tent, either.\u00a0\n\nDo you have an assistant if I want a second photographer?\n\nNothing but professionals here. I do not employ assistants, interns, or any other kind of helpers when it comes to creating photos & videos at a wedding. I hire a seasoned second photographer from a network of fellow professional photographers who\u00a0all shoot weddings on their own, but are not photographing the day you\u2019ve booked me. Cost for a second photographer is generally based on the number of hours they are photographing.\n\nBig Studios Part 1: \u201cI talked to a large photography studio that does weddings and they warned me against using an independent photographer.\u201d\n\nBig studios are playing up their assets to cover up their short fallings. They can often use over a dozen different photographers throughout the course of the year. Most of their photographers have limited investment in the longevity of the studio and view it as just working for some one else till they can open their own studio. Also, photos you may see on their companies web site often aren\u2019t taken by the same photographer you\u2019re getting. Or worse, the images in the studio\u2019s portfolio are by some one who doesn\u2019t even work there anymore. Read the next questions to see some more scare tactics a large studio might use. Your photographer should be the one you talk to from start to finish, not just some one you meet once and then follows notes taken from the sales person who booked the wedding.\n\nBig Studios Part 2: \u201cWhat happens if the independent photographer is hit by a bus on the way to the church?\u201d\n\nWhile this question isn\u2019t word for word, it\u2019s from an FAQ of a big studio\u2019s website.\u00a0Every bride fears the \u201cRainy Day\u201d scenario. You know the story, it will rain, the cake will fall over, the photographer won\u2019t show up and the groom will run off with the Maid of Honor. The fear os this happening has actually created an subset of insurance polices for such things. Sure, a big studio may be able to get you a replacement one or two days before, but even they would be hard pressed to find someone an hour or two before the ceremony, and either-way do you really want to pay top dollar for a the low man on the totem pole? Over the years, myself and several other photographers have set up a small network to address this issue. We generally find one of us who isn\u2019t working that weekend to fill in as a backup for worst case scenarios. However, if you still have this fear, I always suggest getting a\u00a0second photographer. In the unlikely event of my near fatal bus encounter however, any deposit or payment already made for the second photographer would be refunded.\n\nBig Studios Part 3: \u201cSome photographers use their house as their office. Where do you go if there\u2019s a problem?\u201d\n\nYes, I do use my house. I use book stores, coffee houses. I\u2019ve even met a couple from Milwaukee at the I-94 Oasis in Deerfield. Lets be honest here, traffic stinks! If you\u2019re not in the same area as me and would like to meet in between, I\u2019ll gladly travel, even if you haven\u2019t booked me yet. I use my home address, not a PO Box, for all mail correspondence. How does that big studio that uses the name of it\u2019s great grandfather deal with complaints? \u201cThat photographer doesn\u2019t work for us anymore.\u201d I can\u2019t do that, so not only do you know where I live, my name is my reputation.\n\nBig Studios Part 4: \u201cYou should use a photographer who only shoots weddings. They will know the right positions and lighting techniques.\u201d\n\nBesides the fact that I meet with couples at least once before their wedding to go over a time line and ceremony layout, a good photographer knows how to adjust for lighting and position. I\u2019ve shot professional sports in blizzards & rain storms, followed elected officials & celebrities in and our of crowded buildings on assignments, so I\u2019m not really worried about my skills when it comes to shooting at a church, ballroom, or an outdoor wedding you shouldn\u2019t be either.\n\nDo I get to see proofs?\n\nThe simple answer is, no, I do not do proofs. Proofs were generally a quick and low quality print to help couples pick out what they wanted printed, or in an album and typically thrown away. Now days you get to see the real thing and you get to keep it too. Included with every package is non-watermarked full digital copies. \u00a0However, I will gladly get your proofs if you want them, but it would be an additional cost.\n\nDo I get digital copies of everything you shoot?\n\nYes. Do you really want to have to track down a studio, or photographer each time you want a new 8\u00d710? No you don\u2019t. As part of every package I include full copies of every image I take. Make them into Christmas cards or create your own album. Each contract includes an unlimited personal usage rights to the photos. They are yours to use in any non-commercial way you want.\n\nI want a wedding album, what do you offer?\n\nMy go to wedding albums are custom designed by me, and hand-printed in Italy.\n\nAlbums, custom designed by me & hand printed in Italy.\n\nI typically work with albums with a full page real photographic prints, but I can do everything from an old school matte frame album, to a softcover magazine style album. Want small business card size flip books to give away as presents, or thank yous? I can do that too. Parent\u2019s books, travel albums or the gra... (truncated)",

        "text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\nAre your packages customizable?\n\nYes! My focus is to make sure you get everything you want and need!\n\nHow many images will we receive?\n\nThe number of Images delivered ultimately depends on how many it takes to tell your story and the amount of time we are there capturing your day. We don\u2019t limit the number we take; however, the amount we deliver depends on the length of day and the content of the events of the day. We go through all of the images we take and eliminate images with duplicates, exposure failures, people walking in frame, etc. There\u2019s very little that gets eliminated.\n\nWhere do you live and do you travel?\n\nWe live in Binghamton, NY and LOVE traveling to new places, so we\u2019ll go anywhere!\u00a0 We have photographed weddings all over New York State and Northern Pennsylvania: Philadelphia, PA: Sugarbush Ski Resort, VT: Block Island, RI: Atlanta GA, Las Vegas, NV: Auburn, CA: Vietnam: Port St. Lucie, FL: Tampa, FL: Alexandria, VA: Germany: Long Island, NY: & Jamaica.\u00a0\n\nAnything within a 2 hour distance- travel is included.\u00a0 If the distance is over 2 hours, travel expenses apply.\u00a0 Travel expenses are handled very simply: if airfare, hotel, and a rental car are required, the collections remain the same and a full reimbursement for our expenses is added to them.\u00a0 International travel is also available!\u00a0 KJ and I love to travel, and have figured out a few oragami-esc ways to sleep on planes. No matter the distance! We've shot a 12 hour wedding, went home, jumped on a plane at 7am for another wedding at 3pm.\u00a0 Probably won't do that again, but we loved it!\n\nIs KJ at every wedding?\n\nUnfortunately no. He is an officer in the Army National Guard, so there are dates he will not be able to be with us. In that instance, I do have other people I can rely on to fill his shoes at no extra cost to you.\n\nDo we need to feed you at the reception?\n\nYes please! I would prefer to not pass out in the middle of the reception from low blood sugar, or resort to the fallen mints at the bottom of my purse. It doesn\u2019t have to be the filet you\u2019re feeding your guests, but feeding us most preferred! On that note, we also prefer to eat dinner at the same time you do; this doesn\u2019t always work out but it makes the reception coverage go smoother. While you\u2019re seated and eating, we are too so we\u2019re ready to go when you are!\n\nIs a wedding timeline necessary?\n\nYES! You want to make sure your wedding day goes as smooth as possible and all of your vendors are on the same page. It will not fix all of the possible hiccups that can happen but it keeps things in order.\u00a0 I love to work with clients to make sure there\u2019s ample opportunity for everything you want to do. This is also from a photographer\u2019s perspective, working with all of your vendors on this keeps the day in order.\n\nWhat is a First Look?\n\nA first look is when a bride and groom opt to see each other before the ceremony. Not only does it allow you to spend some sweet one-on-one time before the whirlwind of wedding festivities, but it ensures ample time for naturally-lit portraits and makes the day a lot smoother! (In my humble opinion).\n\nWhat is a Day-After Session?\n\nA day-after session is also known as a \u201cRock the Dress\u201d session. It\u2019s a shoot scheduled sometime after the wedding to put the dress back on and scamper about somewhere. It\u2019s especially useful if time did not allow for many formal photos of you and your soon-to-be! \u00a0For destination weddings, it\u2019s fun to put the dress back on and go somewhere we didn\u2019t have a chance to explore on the day of.\n\nBlock Island Rhode Island Wedding Photography\n\nCan our family + friends take photos?\n\nAbsolutely! We just love seeing ipads and cameras jump in front of us during your first kiss! (I\u2019m being sarcastic. Your family and friends are more than welcome to take photos during the day. We do suggest an unplugged ceremony, so the above does not happen. This is not only for selfish reasons, but in a day and age of everything being plugged people forget to be present and in the moment. This is a chance for them to do just that. Wouldn\u2019t you love to be able to look at people\u2019s faces instead of their super awesome Etsy phone case?\n\nWhat is your pricing?\n\nOur wedding collections start at $2300; every collection includes various times of coverage, the edited images with a print release, and an engagement session.\u00a0 For a detailed look into the collections we offer, click Here and contact us!\n\nDo you edit all of our photos?\n\nYes we do! We hand select every photo, and give them an overhaul. We keep the editing crisp and accentuate what we aimed for in camera. We believe in the accuracy of the photo captured in the moment.\n\nDo you do video too?\n\nWe currently do not incorporate video in our wedding coverage. It takes a completely separate brain to shoot video than it does for photo, so we concentrate on one over the other.\n\nCan we see some full weddings?\n\nAbsolutely! Head over to the contact page and send me a message; I\u2019ll include a couple examples of full wedding galleries in my response email.\n\nAre our images watermarked?\n\u00a0\u00a0 No they are not, the images I send to you are free of my watermark!\n\nDo we get to keep the raw files?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNo, the only images I deliver are Hi-Res JPEGs. The unedited\/ RAW files are not available for viewing or purchase. The RAW files essentially contain the ingredients used to create the final product of your image. The result that you see is like the cake that\u2019s on display at the reception: beautiful, decorated, and finalized. Everything we deliver is a well-rounded view of your wedding!\n\nDo you need to attend the rehearsal?\n\nIt\u2019s not at all necessary!\u00a0 We have gone through the timeline, and there\u2019s nothing that can shock me (not even being mooned by the best man!) For destination weddings, people sometimes add on rehearsal dinner coverage to tell a complete story of the event.\n\nDo you offer engagement sessions?\n\nYes!\u00a0 We include the option to have an engagement session with every collection. It\u2019s to get you more comfortable in front of the camera. We know that not everyone has their glamour shots taken at every turn of event, this gives you some great practice! They are up to 1 hour long with 1 outfit, 1 location and you can travel up to 1 hour from Binghamton. If you're looking for something a bit more pizzazzy you can upgrade your engagement session to include more. They're a lot of fun to get dressed up for; make it a date night with your sweetie afterward! Please note, we only offer the engagement sessions during the week. We are not available on the weekend to accommodate them. Space is limited.\u00a0If you would like to know more about the engagement session, head to the contact form and inquire!\n\n\nHow would you describe your style?\n\nThere is no simple way to answer this question. I often turn the question around and ask what they felt or saw when they viewed our work. The answers I\u2019ve received back are: organic, journalistic, raw, bold, vibrant, brilliant, moody, not-boring, etc. Though these adjectives don\u2019t speak directly to our \u2018style\u2019 of photography, they speak to what you\u2019ll find through the galleries. In photo-jargin, the answer stems from two descriptions: photojournalist and traditional. I can speak more at length to what this really means, but that will take a long time. Traditional speaks to the \u2018posed\u2019 photos. The ones of you and your family, the images of you looking into the camera; you know, the ones that 99% of the time get printed over anything else. Photo-journalism speaks to the moments that unfold naturally. What you\u2019ll find from us, is something bold, and brilliant. We have moments of photojournalism, and then moments of traditional. I feel there needs to be a combination of the two styles in order to capture a well-rounded wedding day.\n\nDo you take posed family photos?\n\nOf course I do!! I personally LOVE this part of the wedding day. Call me crazy. It\u2019s the most hated time of day. No one wants to stick around, everyone wants to get the party going, and they\u2019re accustomed to being in a stuffy church without air-conditioning while the photographer takes forever to group and gather everyone. This is not the case with us. We have a system down to a science to get these done to such efficiency you\u2019ll actually have a great time taking these. These are some of the most important images of the day (to me). Everyone in your family looks their best, they\u2019re in one place, and sometimes, it\u2019s the last professional photo of someone before they die. They\u2019re important, and these are the images that gets printed, albeit for you or for your family. *hint hint: These become Gold for Christmas gifts!\n\nCan I send you a shot list or my Pinterest board?\n\nYou can, but I would rather you didn\u2019t. I like Pinterest boards as \u2018feeling boards\u2019 instead of the \u201c100 top photos that I HAVE to have from my wedding\u201d board.\u00a0 It never pans out the way you want them to.\u00a0 There\u2019s never any time. The get overlooked. They look stuffy. We miss out on creating something unique to you that could become the photo that Everyone wants to recreate. I gladly take requests like, \u201cI would love a night shot, or the willow tree on the property is what sold me- can we shoot there? Answer: no problem! I do ask for a family photo shot list: about a month before the wedding I provide you with an outline of what a typical family list looks like, then you can tweak it from there. \u00a0If you have any questions about any of this, I will gladly explain more.\n\nTerra Cotta Wedding Receptions\n\n\nDo you have insurance?\n\u00a0\u00a0 Yes! A thousand times, Yes!\n\nWhat equipment so you use?\n\nIn the world of Nikon v. Canon, we are with Nikon. I could go on and on about all the technical jargin on why Nikon, but basically it stems down to it\u2019s who we started with and what we love! Canon has great equipment, but we love Nikon!\n\nHow long have you been in business?\n\nWe have been photographing weddings for about 5 years.

        "text":"How Much Are Your Packages?\u00a0\n\nWhen shooting your wedding our primary goal is to capture images that invoke the same feelings of joy, excitement and elation you and your guests are experiencing on such an extraordinary occasion. You can relive these feelings every time you see your wedding photographs from just $2750. \u00a0A 1\/3 non-refundable deposit is required on booking to secure your date and ensure that Karen is available to shoot your wedding.\u00a0 The deposit is then taken off the balance of your photography package.\n\nCoffs Harbour wedding photography.jpg\n\nWhat will we get?\u00a0\n\n\nEvery couple receives the following:\n\nComprehensive Pre-Wedding Consultation\n\nWedding photography is vitally important to your wedding day. It is for this reason that Karen sets aside a special time and place to meet and go over absolutely everything you might need to know. Over the years Karen has attended many weddings and as a result has significant insight into what works and what doesn\u2019t. It is a good opportunity for you to nut out some of the details you may not be quite sure on as well as put together a plan for your photography to ensure that nothing is left to chance.\n\n\nYour wedding story told in \u00a0Stunning High Resolution Images on USB\n\nKaren creates a collection of images specifically tailored to tell your wedding story, perfectly from start to finish. These image files are then passed on to our professional image editor who ensures every file is consistently stunning and worthy of being hung on a wall. Karen then presents you with 2 USB\u2019s. 1 of the high-resolution images in color and another with all the same images processed in black & white.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe just went through the photos. They are simply AMAZING!!!! They are so beautiful, and I love that you capture the random funny moments and the emotion. Thank you soooo much. I now have gorgeous memories for the rest of our lives, I could not be happier with the photos :)\n\u2014 Tiffany, Inverell NSW\n\nCan we have an engagement shoot?\n\nYes. In fact we strongly encourage it! An engagement shoot is an excellent way for us to get to know each other! It also helps Karen learn the best approach to photographing you and helps you to become more comfortable in front of the camera. Engagement images are also useful in the lead up to your wedding, perfect for use on save the date cards, invitations or even as details at your wedding.\n\nI prefer a relaxed candid style, is this what we can expect from you?\n\nYes. For most of the day I will stand back and let things unfold in front of my camera. Only during the family and formal portraits will I give some direction to help everyone look their best. For the most part we just have fun.\n\nNew England Wedding Photography Inverell.jpg\n\n\n\nDo You Travel?\n\nAbsolutely! In fact we love too! Karen will travel anywhere in the world to shoot your wedding. Because we are located in a small country town travelling is essential for our business. It is for this reason that the majority of our weddings are not local.\n\n\nHow Much Does Travel Cost?\u00a0\n\nThis depends largely on your location, but the majority of the time there is no extra charge involved. Get in touch and we will look into it and get back to you :)\n\n\nDo you edit your images?\n\nYes and no. We have a professional retoucher who\u2019s job it is to edit your collection and ensure that all your images are stunning and consistent. It also helps us get your images to you far sooner then most other wedding photographers.\n\nThank you so much, such an amazing photographer. You made our day so much fun and have given us something to remember for a life time xx\n\u2014 Lin, Brisbane QLD\n\nsaumarez armidale Wedding Photography.jpg\nYou captured our wedding day perfectly! The photos are natural and beautiful, just what I imagined they would be and so much more!!! They are snippets of our day that I will cherish forever!\n\u2014 Elissa, Inverell NSW\n\n\nOur albums are assembled by a team of highly skilled bookbinders, designed by Karen and hand crafted using the finest materials imported from Europe. Your album will capture the joy of your wedding while telling the story of your day and forever take you back to the happiest day of you life.\n\n\n\nDo we sign a contract when we book?\n\nYes. Our solicitor has designed a contract specifically for your needs that protects both yourself and Karen. Karen will go over this with you during your consultation to ensure that you understand exactly what is involved before signing your life away.\n\nInverell Wedding Photography Couple Photography New England\n\nYour photos are amazing, but you are over our budget, are you able to decrease the price?\n\nUnfortunately no. Due to high demand we have found that it is not necessary to offer discounts. We offer our clients the best possible images, products and service. In order to do so it is necessary to charge an appropriate amount. \u00a0\n\nWhy do some other photographers have cheaper prices?\n\nOur collections are priced to reflect the quality of photographs and service we offer. Cheaper photographers may; photograph only as a hobby, work with out insurance, have low quality equipment, be inexperienced and possibly all of the above.\u00a0\n\nSo in love with all of my photos!!! Thankyou!\n\u2014 Mia, NSW\n\nHow many photographs do you take at weddings?\n\nFirst and foremost our goal is to tell the story of your wedding day in high quality images. Every wedding is unique so there is no set amount of images taken. We do however guarantee a minimum amount according to the package option you choose.\n\nInverell Wedding Photography\n\nHow many weddings do you shoot in a year?\n\nIn order to ensure all our clients receive the best possible service I have made the decision to limit the amount of weddings I shoot per year. As a result our dates are limited, so it is recommended that you book as soon as you can to ensure you don\u2019t miss out on having Karen photograph your wedding.\n\n\nAre we able to get a copy of the high resolution image files?\n\nYes. You will receive the final collection of images on USB in both color and black and white.\n\nCan we provide you with a list of photographs we want taken?\n\nYes, absolutely. While our coverage is very thorough, there may be some aspects we are unaware of e.g your pen pal from Holland has made a special trip for your wedding and you would like a photograph of the both of you. You will receive a form in your welcome pack to help make this easier.\n\nInverell Engagement Photography\n\n\nWhat are we allowed to do with our digital files?\n\nProvided the guidelines within the contract are upheld, any images you receive are yours to do with as you please. For example, making prints, emailing or post them on Facebook. It is entirely up to you!\n\nDo you back up your images?\n\nMy camera is recording to 2 memory cards at one time, so I have an instant back up. As soon as I can I copy the images to 2 separate hard drives. I then keep your images on file for a minimum of 5 years.",

Is it better to post a link to my illustration to Twitter, or the illustration itself?\n\nA. I used to always post a link, to encourage people to go to my blog. Nowadays, however, I'm finding that fewer people follow links to images. Instead, I post the image directly to Twitter, but make sure my name and URL are part of the image, and I also try to squeeze in my Twitter id as well.\n\nAnd even when I post an image directly to Twitter, I find I get far more response if I make the descriptive text interesting, rather than just \"My doodle of the day:\" or something similarly bland.

We also hold a winter term of classes December\u2013January.\u00a0\n\nThe current calendar is here\n\nWhat should I do if I arrive early to a performance?\n\nTypically, doors to our gallery open an hour before the event begins. Please check individual confirmation emails prior to your specific event to be sure this is the case. You are welcome to spend time in our gallery and enjoy our art exhibition during this time. Refreshments are available as well.\u00a0\n\nWhat if a program does not list an end time? How will I know when the program is scheduled to end?\n\nUnfortunately we will not always know this information. If time is sensitive to your plans, please speak to our house manager before the event begins to learn about intermission times (if applicable) and how long the program is expected to run.\u00a0\n\n\nHow does the submission process work? Who reviews submissions?\n\nYour submission will be carefully reviewed by IAC programming staff in tandem with IAC\u2019s Executive Director. Proposals under consideration for future programming are reviewed with artistic advisors in the relevant disciplines, and decisions are made based on a variety of factors including artistic standard, disciplinary diversity, cultural relevance as it relates to our mission, timing, budget, and other strategic considerations.\nProposals that are not selected are kept on file for a minimum of two years.\n\nDo I have to be Irish to submit?\n\nNot necessarily. Our mission is to project a dynamic image of the evolving culture of Ireland and Irish America, and we welcome proposals for work at the highest standard from artists of all backgrounds.\n\nI am already planning to travel to New York to present my work. Can I submit a proposal to present at Irish Arts Center? Is your space available to rent?\n\nIAC welcomes submissions from individual artists and production companies that\u00a0are planning to travel to New York to present their work, though as mentioned\u00a0previously, we often program as much as 18 months in advance. IAC\u2019s 99-seat\u00a0Donaghy Theatre is often available to rent during the summer months\u00a0(June-August), and classroom and rehearsal space is occasionally available during\u00a0the spring and fall seasons.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t I received a response to my submission?\n\nIAC receives a high volume of excellent submissions across all of the disciplines. We work very hard to carefully review each submission, and therefore we ask for your patience. While we are unable to respond to each submission, we will reach out to those whose proposals are under consideration for an upcoming season.\n\n\nHow do I register for a class?

You still get the full eight (8) hours.\n\nI have taken [instrument or dance] before, but many years ago and I feel a bit rusty. Should I still sign up for Level 1?\n\nAll Level 1 classes are designed for an absolute beginner: someone who has never, for example, held a fiddle before; learned a bit of conversational Irish; or taken a step dance class. In most Level 1 classes, students come away with 2-3 tunes or dances before they move onto the next level. For many, if you have taken the specific dance or instrument previously, even if many years back, we recommend beginning at Level 2.\n\nShould you find within the first two weeks of class you would like to switch levels, we are happy to accommodate providing there is space in the class you wish to move to. We want you to enjoy, and get the most out of, your class experience!

        "text":"What is beauty architecture?\n\nWhat is beauty architecture?\n\nBeauty, in architecture, lies in the performance and behaviour of building\u2019s structure and fa\u00e7ade elements as a component. The structural form should have an aesthetic appeal while being simultaneously driven by engineering considerations.\n\nHow do you appreciate architecture?\n\nHere\u2019s how to tell the difference:Embrace the totality of architecture. Appreciating architecture really begins with understanding what it is and what it isn\u2019t. Grasp the building\u2019s purpose \u2014 and ambition. Tune in to your emotions. Look for transcendence. Look for complete designs.\n\nWhat defines good architecture?\n\nIt should work well and answer all codes, but that is only the beginning point. It should use minimal amounts of energy both in construction and in use. It should offer spaces that do not imprison and pigeonhole us. It should enhance its site. It should be beautiful.\n\nHow important is it for a city to have beautiful architecture?\n\nArchitects add art, creativity, and beauty to our day lives in ways we don\u2019t expect. They know how to design your favorite little alcove or how to give your building the best view. In fact, studies show that areas with good architecture and design create stronger communities with healthier neighborhoods and businesses.\n\nWhy should I study architecture?\n\nTo Become a Brilliant Problem Solver. Architecture school teaches you to take a pile of data and information and interpret it to inform how to design a building or solve a problem.
