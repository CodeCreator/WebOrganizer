Key loves skateboarding and digital media.\n\nWhat do you get when you put those together? The Gamut Middle School Technology Club!\n\nThe Creators\n\nLaura Knatt (Contact at lauraknatt (at) yahoo [dot] com)\nYou may know her from her previously completed comic Taiki or her Pokemon fan comic Ultimate Quest. She graduated from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising with a degree in Graphic Design but making comics is what she really loves doing.\n\nHayley Larsh\nAspiring writer, she hopes that one day she can write well enough to have a novel published by DAW or TOR. She also has the most adorable cat in the world.\n\nThe Process : What do Laura and Hayley do?\n\nLaura came up with the concept of CMYK in 2010 while still working on her other comic Taiki. She met Hayley who helped her finish writing Taiki and together they worked on forming CMYK. They brainstorm the episodes and Hayley writes the final script while Laura draws the pages.\n\n\nWhat is C.M.Y.K?\nCMYK refers to the four inks used in some color printing: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (black).\n\nWhy is Key not named after a color?\nThe main concept of how this comic is colored is based off of the color process of CMYK (see above question) in which the \u201cK\u201d stands for Key and IS Black.\n\nWhy are some characters colored in some Episodes but not all?\nCyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key will always be colored in every Episode. Side characters are only colored when they are considered a main part of the story in the specific Episode.",

        "text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\nAre your packages customizable?\n\nYes! My focus is to make sure you get everything you want and need!\n\nHow many images will we receive?\n\nThe number of Images delivered ultimately depends on how many it takes to tell your story and the amount of time we are there capturing your day. We don\u2019t limit the number we take; however, the amount we deliver depends on the length of day and the content of the events of the day. We go through all of the images we take and eliminate images with duplicates, exposure failures, people walking in frame, etc. There\u2019s very little that gets eliminated.\n\nWhere do you live and do you travel?\n\nWe live in Binghamton, NY and LOVE traveling to new places, so we\u2019ll go anywhere!\u00a0 We have photographed weddings all over New York State and Northern Pennsylvania: Philadelphia, PA: Sugarbush Ski Resort, VT: Block Island, RI: Atlanta GA, Las Vegas, NV: Auburn, CA: Vietnam: Port St. Lucie, FL: Tampa, FL: Alexandria, VA: Germany: Long Island, NY: & Jamaica.\u00a0\n\nAnything within a 2 hour distance- travel is included.\u00a0 If the distance is over 2 hours, travel expenses apply.\u00a0 Travel expenses are handled very simply: if airfare, hotel, and a rental car are required, the collections remain the same and a full reimbursement for our expenses is added to them.\u00a0 International travel is also available!\u00a0 KJ and I love to travel, and have figured out a few oragami-esc ways to sleep on planes. No matter the distance! We've shot a 12 hour wedding, went home, jumped on a plane at 7am for another wedding at 3pm.\u00a0 Probably won't do that again, but we loved it!\n\nIs KJ at every wedding?\n\nUnfortunately no. He is an officer in the Army National Guard, so there are dates he will not be able to be with us. In that instance, I do have other people I can rely on to fill his shoes at no extra cost to you.\n\nDo we need to feed you at the reception?\n\nYes please! I would prefer to not pass out in the middle of the reception from low blood sugar, or resort to the fallen mints at the bottom of my purse. It doesn\u2019t have to be the filet you\u2019re feeding your guests, but feeding us most preferred! On that note, we also prefer to eat dinner at the same time you do; this doesn\u2019t always work out but it makes the reception coverage go smoother. While you\u2019re seated and eating, we are too so we\u2019re ready to go when you are!\n\nIs a wedding timeline necessary?\n\nYES! You want to make sure your wedding day goes as smooth as possible and all of your vendors are on the same page. It will not fix all of the possible hiccups that can happen but it keeps things in order.\u00a0 I love to work with clients to make sure there\u2019s ample opportunity for everything you want to do. This is also from a photographer\u2019s perspective, working with all of your vendors on this keeps the day in order.\n\nWhat is a First Look?\n\nA first look is when a bride and groom opt to see each other before the ceremony. Not only does it allow you to spend some sweet one-on-one time before the whirlwind of wedding festivities, but it ensures ample time for naturally-lit portraits and makes the day a lot smoother! (In my humble opinion).\n\nWhat is a Day-After Session?\n\nA day-after session is also known as a \u201cRock the Dress\u201d session. It\u2019s a shoot scheduled sometime after the wedding to put the dress back on and scamper about somewhere. It\u2019s especially useful if time did not allow for many formal photos of you and your soon-to-be! \u00a0For destination weddings, it\u2019s fun to put the dress back on and go somewhere we didn\u2019t have a chance to explore on the day of.\n\nBlock Island Rhode Island Wedding Photography\n\nCan our family + friends take photos?\n\nAbsolutely! We just love seeing ipads and cameras jump in front of us during your first kiss! (I\u2019m being sarcastic. Your family and friends are more than welcome to take photos during the day. We do suggest an unplugged ceremony, so the above does not happen. This is not only for selfish reasons, but in a day and age of everything being plugged people forget to be present and in the moment. This is a chance for them to do just that. Wouldn\u2019t you love to be able to look at people\u2019s faces instead of their super awesome Etsy phone case?\n\nWhat is your pricing?\n\nOur wedding collections start at $2300; every collection includes various times of coverage, the edited images with a print release, and an engagement session.\u00a0 For a detailed look into the collections we offer, click Here and contact us!\n\nDo you edit all of our photos?\n\nYes we do! We hand select every photo, and give them an overhaul. We keep the editing crisp and accentuate what we aimed for in camera. We believe in the accuracy of the photo captured in the moment.\n\nDo you do video too?\n\nWe currently do not incorporate video in our wedding coverage. It takes a completely separate brain to shoot video than it does for photo, so we concentrate on one over the other.\n\nCan we see some full weddings?\n\nAbsolutely! Head over to the contact page and send me a message; I\u2019ll include a couple examples of full wedding galleries in my response email.\n\nAre our images watermarked?\n\u00a0\u00a0 No they are not, the images I send to you are free of my watermark!\n\nDo we get to keep the raw files?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNo, the only images I deliver are Hi-Res JPEGs. The unedited\/ RAW files are not available for viewing or purchase. The RAW files essentially contain the ingredients used to create the final product of your image. The result that you see is like the cake that\u2019s on display at the reception: beautiful, decorated, and finalized. Everything we deliver is a well-rounded view of your wedding!\n\nDo you need to attend the rehearsal?\n\nIt\u2019s not at all necessary!\u00a0 We have gone through the timeline, and there\u2019s nothing that can shock me (not even being mooned by the best man!) For destination weddings, people sometimes add on rehearsal dinner coverage to tell a complete story of the event.\n\nDo you offer engagement sessions?\n\nYes!\u00a0 We include the option to have an engagement session with every collection. It\u2019s to get you more comfortable in front of the camera. We know that not everyone has their glamour shots taken at every turn of event, this gives you some great practice! They are up to 1 hour long with 1 outfit, 1 location and you can travel up to 1 hour from Binghamton. If you're looking for something a bit more pizzazzy you can upgrade your engagement session to include more. They're a lot of fun to get dressed up for; make it a date night with your sweetie afterward! Please note, we only offer the engagement sessions during the week. We are not available on the weekend to accommodate them. Space is limited.\u00a0If you would like to know more about the engagement session, head to the contact form and inquire!\n\n\nHow would you describe your style?\n\nThere is no simple way to answer this question. I often turn the question around and ask what they felt or saw when they viewed our work. The answers I\u2019ve received back are: organic, journalistic, raw, bold, vibrant, brilliant, moody, not-boring, etc. Though these adjectives don\u2019t speak directly to our \u2018style\u2019 of photography, they speak to what you\u2019ll find through the galleries. In photo-jargin, the answer stems from two descriptions: photojournalist and traditional. I can speak more at length to what this really means, but that will take a long time. Traditional speaks to the \u2018posed\u2019 photos. The ones of you and your family, the images of you looking into the camera; you know, the ones that 99% of the time get printed over anything else. Photo-journalism speaks to the moments that unfold naturally. What you\u2019ll find from us, is something bold, and brilliant. We have moments of photojournalism, and then moments of traditional. I feel there needs to be a combination of the two styles in order to capture a well-rounded wedding day.\n\nDo you take posed family photos?\n\nOf course I do!! I personally LOVE this part of the wedding day. Call me crazy. It\u2019s the most hated time of day. No one wants to stick around, everyone wants to get the party going, and they\u2019re accustomed to being in a stuffy church without air-conditioning while the photographer takes forever to group and gather everyone. This is not the case with us. We have a system down to a science to get these done to such efficiency you\u2019ll actually have a great time taking these. These are some of the most important images of the day (to me). Everyone in your family looks their best, they\u2019re in one place, and sometimes, it\u2019s the last professional photo of someone before they die. They\u2019re important, and these are the images that gets printed, albeit for you or for your family. *hint hint: These become Gold for Christmas gifts!\n\nCan I send you a shot list or my Pinterest board?\n\nYou can, but I would rather you didn\u2019t. I like Pinterest boards as \u2018feeling boards\u2019 instead of the \u201c100 top photos that I HAVE to have from my wedding\u201d board.\u00a0 It never pans out the way you want them to.\u00a0 There\u2019s never any time. The get overlooked. They look stuffy. We miss out on creating something unique to you that could become the photo that Everyone wants to recreate. I gladly take requests like, \u201cI would love a night shot, or the willow tree on the property is what sold me- can we shoot there? Answer: no problem! I do ask for a family photo shot list: about a month before the wedding I provide you with an outline of what a typical family list looks like, then you can tweak it from there. \u00a0If you have any questions about any of this, I will gladly explain more.\n\nTerra Cotta Wedding Receptions\n\n\nDo you have insurance?\n\u00a0\u00a0 Yes! A thousand times, Yes!\n\nWhat equipment so you use?\n\nIn the world of Nikon v. Canon, we are with Nikon. I could go on and on about all the technical jargin on why Nikon, but basically it stems down to it\u2019s who we started with and what we love! Canon has great equipment, but we love Nikon!\n\nHow long have you been in business?\n\nWe have been photographing weddings for about 5 years. Our official start is a bit hazy, but it\u2019s been a w... (truncated)",

        "text":"What is a gicl\u00e9e print? Essentially,\u00a0a gicl\u00e9e print is the closest reproduction to\u00a0a piece of original\u00a0artwork available. Sometimes it is almost indistinguishable from the\u00a0original work. Gicl\u00e9e\u00a0prints differ from cheaper, digital prints in several ways: \u00a0\n\n1. They are made on expensive, high-quality\u00a0printers that use 9 different ink\u00a0cartridge\u00a0colors which gives much greater depth of image than a standard CMYK only printer.\n\n2. The inks used are pigment-based\u00a0instead of dye-based inks. These inks give the prints their archival quality- they are\u00a0guaranteed not to fade for at least 99 years.\u00a0\n\n3. The paper is archival-- 100% cotton and\u00a0acid free. The\u00a0printing process allows the inks to sink in and be obsorbed into the paper mainting a rich, matte finish just like the original painting. You'll notice with less-expensive digital prints, the ink sits on top creating a sheen.\n\nCan I purchase a print of one of you\u00a0artworks that is not for sale in your\u00a0shop?\u00a0I do not offer prints of client work- only my own work. If there is a piece of my personal work that you would like to see prints of, please let me know. If I get enough requests I will do a run of prints.\n\nShipping:\u00a0\u00a0All purchases will be\u00a0shipped via USPS \u00a0within 2 business days of completed payment.\n\n\nNotecards will be shipped via First Class mail which is estimated at 1-3 days. No tracking is provided.\n\n\nEverything else will be shipped via USPS Priority.\u00a0A tracking number will be sent to you once it ships. Priority mail usually arrives anywhere in the continental US in 2-3 business days, but it is NOT\u00a0guaranteed.\n\n\nIf you need your package\u00a0guaranteed\u00a0by a certain date, please contact info@janelkennedy\u00a0to arrange an express\u00a0shipping method.\u00a0\n\nInternational Shipping:\u00a0I am currently not offering international shipping. The cost for any shipping method that comes with tracking info is so high that it exceeds the cost of the actual item being purchased. USPS does offer first class international shipping, which is\u00a0affordable, but does not offer tracking\u00a0and I don't trust them to ship without tracking. If you want to pay a large sum for international shipping, I will do it. Just contact me first:\n\nReturns\/ exchanges: I want you to be completely happy with your purchase. If for any reason you are not, please contact me and I'll make it right.\n\nGifts:\u00a0 I'm all about prezzies! To ship strait to a recipient simply enter\u00a0their information\u00a0in the shipping address and yours in the billing. \u00a0I\u00a0am currently working on a \"gift\" option where for $5 you can add\u00a0gift wrapping and a personal message to the recipient. \u00a0Until this option is live, feel free to email me to set this up.\n\n  \u2022 Instagram Black Round\n  \u2022 Pinterest Black Round\n  \u2022 Copyright symbol copy.png",
