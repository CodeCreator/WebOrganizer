        "text":"#doyouevenunicorn Made Us Unicorn Believers\n\nA hodge-podge concoction where pop culture, queer creativity, social commentary and a healthy perv on a naked man-beast collide!\n\nDo you believe in unicorns? If not, well it\u2019s time to start. We were not believers until we found our very own real-life unicorn, and let me tell you this unicorn is not what you see in children\u2019s books. @doyouevenunicorn on Instagram is charming and has the body that will quench your thirst for something magical. We\u2019re living in a time of division, heightened racial tensions, and political dis-ease, and if you\u2019re like us, you\u2019re often looking for a sign that everything will get better.\n\nSocial media is an escape for many of us. A fascinating part of being in challenging times is that we can bear witness to a level of creative expression that only happens when we are losing hope. Oprah said it best, \u201cEach of us has a personal calling that\u2019s as unique as a fingerprint. And the best way to succeed is to discover what you love and then find a way to offer it to others in the form of service, working hard, and also allowing the energy of the universe to lead you.\u201d\n\nLately, the world has seemed dark so I needed an escape. I started to surf Instagram, and there was one person from Australia who changed my energy from sadness to happy feelings, a person doing unicorn things and junk.\n\nThe handle, @doyouevenunicorn on Instagram might be a life-like unicorn who has the body for the gods, but when you peel back the layers, he is giving us hope, having fun, enjoying his life, and is the latest Kinkster I\u2019ve come across, which is why I asked to interview him.\n\nYou might think it\u2019s a character, but it\u2019s a person whose creative juices are flowing, and it\u2019s the perfect time to showcase him, especially when Australia recently said, \u201cYES\u201d to same-sex marriage. It\u2019s the perfect time to catch up with this innovative and creative Kinkster.\n\nDescribe for our readers the magical place and mind of Do You Even Unicorn.\n\nI like to think of Do You Even Unicorn \u2013 the mind and the page \u2013 as a hodge-podge concoction where pop culture, queer creativity, social commentary and a healthy perv on a naked man-beast collide!\n\nHow did you come up with the name Do You Even Unicorn and what does it represent?\n\nWe\u2019re going back a few years and let\u2019s be real, my brain is mashed potatoes at this point, but from memory, the whole thing came about during the \u201cDo you even lift, bro!?\u201d phenomenon, and who am I to not seize a name that is instantly recognizable? So I think I purposely rode those coattails into existence.\n\nIs there a message to be shared or is this just a fun endeavor?\n\nInitially, it was all just for a laugh. But as my audience grew and I realized I had a platform (albeit a modest one), I acknowledged that I could get some positive messages out there and spread a little awareness about things near and dear to my glitter-filled unicorn heart. Always wrapped up in some comedy and a decent showing of skin, naturally.\n\nHow do you come up with the images for your IG page and what inspires you to come up with the captions attached to each photo?\n\nI wish I had an amazing creative process to let you in on, but it\u2019s all ridiculously haphazard! Inspiration is like a boner \u2013 it can strike anytime and anywhere. It can come from a quote I hear, an image I see, a memory, a night out, you name it! Sometimes it\u2019s just a piece of the final image and I build things around it, other times I get an instant flash of a fully realized end product and I know exactly what I want to produce. Either way, I\u2019ll jot down the thought so it doesn\u2019t get lost among the mash-up of rainbows and sparkles and cute guys dancing around my head (I have a notoriously bad memory at the best of times and get distracted quicker than a caffeinated baby). The captions will either flow organically from that or simply be a quote I find inspiring or hilarious that I\u2019d like to share with my unicorn army.\n\nWhat has been your most talked about the photo so far?\n\nDefinitely, the photo of me, ass-out, laying over my bed and spitting inferred semen into a bucket and wiping the residue from my face. Classy, right!? Haha And what I love most about that is the post was directly inspired by a conversation I had with a friend that went something along the lines of:\n\nUndisclosed friend: \u201cI want to go ask for two or three ice cubes for my wine.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMe: \u201cC\u2019mon, you\u2019re better than that\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\nUndisclosed friend: \u201cI just told you I spat cum into a bin.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMe: \u201cGo get your ice.\u201d\n\nWhich photo has been your most favorite and why?\n\nI hate more than anything to be cliche, but I couldn\u2019t isolate one! My style and approach and aesthetic are continuously evolving, so with that, as is my favorite image. I look back at photos from a year ago that I remember being\u00a0so proud of at the time, and I\u2019m like \u201creally queen\u2026!?\u201d. What I will say, is more often than not, my favorite posts end up not being as universally appreciated as others that I like, but aren\u2019t blown away by. I get a kick out of putting out an image with a fully realized concept and story, a total feel, and one that I may have spent a considerable amount of time on, but then a photo that took literally 30 minutes to put together that shows a lot of skin will get heaps more likes. Y\u2019all are thirsty! Hahahaha!\n\nWhere do you the person and your persona, the hot unicorn man intersect, or not?\n\nThese days, we meet frequently and often and my real-boy Instagram is not too far from paralleling my unicorn persona. I used to be a lot more reserved in my regular IG posts, but the unicorn mask gave me a sort of freedom and anonymity to be a little more salacious and daring, However as I mature and my self-confidence really solidifies, I post suggestive photos quite liberally now on my regular IG account, and am proud of my mental progress and being happy enough with myself to bare all (well,\u00a0almost\u00a0all. Unicorn wang, for now at least, still isn\u2019t on menu).\n\nWill you ever reveal the face behind the mask or will we always just have the mysterious unicorn man to look at?\n\nI have several photos where I play both the unicorn and his bearded dude counterpart, face strategically covered, of course. But I think that\u2019s as close to a reveal as I\u2019ll get. I like keeping the mystery up, and it also allows the viewer to imagine and project whatever they like under that mask, which can really add to their fantasy. But, to be honest, with a little sleuthing, it\u2019s not too hard to marry up my unicorn IG and my real-world IG. While I don\u2019t promote the connection, I often joke that it\u2019s the internet\u2019s worst kept secret.\n\nWhat have you learned about yourself from this creative outlet?\n\nNudity is fun, empowering, and doesn\u2019t always have to be connected to sex! I\u2019ve always had body image and self-confidence issues, so I\u2019ve learned to embrace myself and my body and how I look. Love yourself (physically, if possible *ahem*) and be proud of exactly who you are. A very wise woman once said \u201cYou\u2019re on the right track, baby, you were born this way\u201d but I can\u2019t remember who, I don\u2019t think it was anyone famous \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you see Do You Even Unicorn developing over time? Any plans for merchandise?\n\nI\u2019m just going with the flow for the moment. I\u2019m a pretty busy non-unicorn, but I\u2019ve absolutely had some thoughts about merchandise, it would be a trip to see my face (and let\u2019s face it, my ass) on a t-shirt! So if the demand is there and people would like to see it, I\u2019d definitely be open to creating Do You Even Unicorn merch. If you\u2019re keen, hit me up on the DMs people, I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019d like!\n\nWe like to ask our signature question, aside from being naked in a unicorn mask, what do you consider to be the edgiest, unconventional, or tight-lipped thing you\u2019ve ever done and how did it impact your life?\n\nHmmm, good question, and somewhat confronting! I\u2019ve definitely had my party days and illicit encounters \u2013 often publicly and often with multiple participants, almost always accompanied by mind-altering social lubricants \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure that I found them notably significant or enlightening. For me, the most impactful events are the intimate relationships with partners. I\u2019m thankful for every single one of my past partners and the things I\u2019ve learned about myself through them, no matter how heartbreaking or toxic or unhealthy they may have been at the time. Other than that, I\u2019ve been comparatively tame! I mean, aside from the occasional bondage session or sweaty elevator encounter of the naked kind, but by today\u2019s standards, that\u2019s practically more Disney than deviant. But hey, let\u2019s not close that chapter just yet, I\u2019m always open to suggestions \ud83d\ude09\nFollow @doyouevenunicorn on Instagram\nStyle of Living\n\nFounder, Co-Owner & Managing Editor.

        "text":"Interview with the Sexy Allie Haze\n\nOK, I have to admit it\u2014 as much as I love cock, I think I might have a serious girl crush on Allie Haze! Maybe it\u2019s her girl next door, \u201cI\u2019m secretly a horny slut\u201d, appearance. Or maybe it\u2019s her sweet, genuine, down-to-earth personality that makes her so appealing.\n\nPorn Star Allie Haze\n\nThis 26-year-old smoke show is a California native who tried out many career choices prior to stepping into the adult industry\u2014 namely firefighter and bartender. I\u2019m sure she makes many a hose squirt in her current profession as well as her previous!\n\nBeing brought up in a super religious family, Allie found herself married to a preacher at the age of 18 and then divorced two years later when she realized it just wasn\u2019t what she wanted.\n\nWhen I asked Allie how she got started in the adult industry she said, \u201cWell I\u2019ve always been into girls, and identified as a lesbian when I was younger, before my marriage. But I got sick of going out to bars, picking up women, taking them home, only to find out that they weren\u2019t really into girls and that it was all just for show in front of the guys at the bar. That wasn\u2019t what I wanted because I was really into girls and having sex with women. That\u2019s what pretty much led to me getting into the business because it provided a safe and fun way for me to have sex with other women who liked to have sex, not be a tease for a bunch of guys.\u201d Allie broke into the business by doing strictly girl-girl scenes. When she decided she wanted to try a boy-girl scene, Reality Kings helped pop her cherry in that genre.\n\nLike many of today\u2019s starlets, Allie Haze has made the cross to mainstream. You can currently see her in regular appearances on HBO\u2019s Emmanuelle .\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nBoston Single Girl\n\nTrue stories of the good, the bad and the ugly of single life in Boston.

        "text":"Credit to: Boomber Banks\n\nI have run into a good amount of stars in the industry who have left me leaving with a bunch of different thoughts on who they are not only in it but outside the industry as well.\u00a0 Boomer Banks is someone who caught my eye not only because of his good looks but because when I got to know him he just seemed like a really great guy.\u00a0 When he agreed to do an interview with me and I got to know him more, my beliefs on him were confirmed and I got to know a really great side to him.\u00a0 The new Raging Stallion Exclusive\u00a0 is making a huge name for himself in the industry and on social networking sites like Twitter (9,000 fans and counting) and will be performing tonight at the annual Hustlaball NYC which is one of the biggest gay events in the world.\u00a0 He sat down with me this past week to talk about his meteoric rise in the porn world and some pretty great insight on how he seems things from an insiders prospective.\u00a0 Take a look.\n\nSo Boomer, what made you want to get your start in the industry?\n\nI literally just woke up one day and was given an opportunity and I took it.\u00a0 I am a very spiritual person and I felt that it was right.\u00a0 I don\u2019t tend to run on self will I am a very spiritual person.\u00a0 I love for the universe to bring things into my sphere.\n\nWas your side job as a Rentboy aid this decision or hurt it, because it can go both ways?\n\nNo, it aided it.\u00a0 I guess it opened my mind to what is out there as I\u2019ve heard every request possible.\u00a0 I make it very clear that when i am \u201cescorting\u201d that I will not do anything that I don\u2019t want to do.\u00a0 And to this day I haven\u2019t.\u00a0 I\u2019m very conventional to who I am.\n\nSo let\u2019s keep it real here- you are well endowed.\u00a0 Do you think that has helped in you getting cast in more well known productions?\n\nSo, listen I\u2019m sure that I did get noticed because of that.\u00a0 That can only carry you so far.\u00a0 There are many men that have large cocks that come around but many of them don\u2019t have the staying power.\u00a0 Mind you, I am only saying that in regards to what I\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 I am a lot more than that.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s what Raging Stallion when they wanted to sign me saw that in me.\u00a0 They saw one thing, but then they saw someone that can represent their company as respectful as one can be.\n\nIn terms of porn, is there anyone that you\u2019ve looked up to as an idol?\n\nI am friends with Johnny Hazard, I\u2019ve known him for a year as an acquaintance.\u00a0 He is definitely a confidant in this whole process, great guy.\u00a0 He still to this day is using everything that he has achieved to his advantage without hurting anyone or himself along the way. Since then I have let some legendary people in the industry.\u00a0 Chi Chi Larue has been a huge cheerleader for me, Sister Roma as well.\u00a0 They are all amazing individuals.\u00a0 It\u2019s been very interesting and very welcoming to say the least.\n\n\n\nHow many scenes have you shot so far?\n\nI\u2019ve done five scenes so far, two have been released.\u00a0 One with Marcus Isaacs for \u201cTimberwolves\u201d and James Ryder for the \u201cHard Friction\u201d series.\n\nThe one that was just released that is getting quite a lot of buzz is with Marcus for \u201cTimberwolves\u201d.\u00a0 Tell me about what that experience was for you being that that was your first big scene that you shot.\n\nIt was awesome, it was the most amazing experience for someone not knowing what they were getting into.\u00a0 I know Marcus personally which made it very easy for him to coach and talk to me.\u00a0 Because I am so coachable and easy to talk to it made the whole experience that much better for me.\u00a0 There were even a couple of times where he didn\u2019t need to coach me because I seemed to comfortable.\u00a0 I just felt at ease and even though it was a lot for me take\u00a0 in it got me prepared for every scene going forward which subsequently has made it easier each time.\n\nThis is a question I have never asked anyone before- is there a huge difference between making love on camera and making love to someone in your real life who you actually like on a personal level?\n\nWell number one- Raging Stallion is very much known for their elaborate production of everything.\u00a0 The difference is every ten or fifteen minutes someone has to stop and say \u201cHey, do this\u201d or \u201cNow we are going to do that position\u201d.\u00a0 Porn is a job and people don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s not another hotel room where the cameras are rolling and they let you have sex.\u00a0 It is a very thought out process- we talk about positions and how we are going to end everything, close ups, lighting- it really is a full blown production.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a job when you know someone personally.\n\nDo you think the adult industry lately has more of a negative view or a positive view?\n\nI\u2019m constantly trying not to read things but I come across stuff on Twitter that people seem to think there are things going on behind the scenes.\u00a0 For instance, one being that the porn companies only hire a certain kind of person.\u00a0 Clearly they don\u2019t, hence me.\u00a0 I completely and utterly not Caucasian, I don\u2019t have a hairless body, I take care of myself but I don\u2019t have an airbrushed body.\n\nThen there is the only point where I\u2019ve also read that a lot of porn models don\u2019t like to work with different races.\u00a0 I can\u2019t speak for those other models but I do notice that it\u2019s very rare when that happens.\u00a0 I have no problem with it.\u00a0 I\u2019m a performer and I get paid to do things so I see no problem in being asked to do something and doing it.\u00a0 If you are working at a coffee shop and there is a variety of races working there, you can\u2019t simply say \u201cI can\u2019t serve you coffee because of your race\u201d.\u00a0 It\u2019s the same in both aspects.\n\nPeople also have a lot of opinions on condoms in porn and what not.\u00a0 There is nothing to fear if there is nothing to fear.\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 Just to elaborate on that, if you don\u2019t know something on a particular topic of course there is reason to fear.\u00a0 However, if you really know you really can understand that there is nothing to fear.\u00a0 If you are working in condom porn, there is no chance unless you in your personal life decide to do things outside of that.\n\nWhat are you hopeful for in this industry?\n\nI want to have a good run in this industry. I want it to be filled with integrity and honestly about my sexual freedom which is what i was born with.\u00a0 I want to make a name for myself so that my fashion design becomes more noticed.\u00a0 I will be coming out with a Men\u2019s line geared towards sportswear.\u00a0 There has been a lot of companies that have paved the way, Nasty Pig is one of my favorites.\u00a0 The adult industry porn is an amazing opportunity for me to take everything that i have to show on another level.\u00a0 To all these incredible fans that long for something that they put on a pedestal.\u00a0 I want to use that aspect in a good way because they are the ones who are visiting my pages and buying or streaming my DVD\u2019s or whatever the case may be.\n\nGreat guy and a really profound interview.\u00a0\u00a0 For all things Boomer including upcoming appearances and releases, check out his Twitter page for more information.",

        "text":"The Hook-up: Lady Laid Bare\n\nIntroducing Lady Laid Bare\nSometimes I have a hard time saying no to people. Sometimes that backfires on me. When Lady Laid Bare, aka Jillian Boyd, asked if she could be featured in The Hook-up, I said yes. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t say no.\n\nHow did you get into blogging?\nI was quite a sexual late-bloomer, and at the time I was going through changes I didn\u2019t understand. I\u2019d started watching porn, I\u2019d started dipping toes into reading erotica\u2026 and I couldn\u2019t help feeling really alone. I didn\u2019t really have anyone to talk about these things with.\n\nOne day, I found this blog called Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, written a lady called Hyperballad. That blog pushed me to start my own, and I made it my mission to try and understand what sex meant to me, to other people and to the world.\n\nHow is that mission to understand sex going?\nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by sex, ever since I first became aware of it. But because education on the topic was so lax back home, I didn\u2019t really grasp more than your basic \u201cthis is a woman, this is a man, they have sex to have babies\u201d thing until I started blogging and reading up on it. My world has been broadened immensely, and I\u2019ve learned a lot about myself, my own sexuality and just how broad the sexual spectrum is.\n\nSo, in a way, that mission is going well. But it\u2019s also a continuing process.\n\nWhat got you started writing erotica?\nI originally wanted to be a chick-lit author! I loved reading the genre and convinced myself that I could totally be the next great chick-lit novelist. But it\u2019s a harder genre to work in than you might think. And the only bits that I actually looked forward to writing were the sex bits.\n\nSo, not long after I started the blog, I started experimenting with writing straight-up erotica. At the time, there were two brilliant memes out there (Wank Wednesday, run by Ruby Kiddell, and Fuck Me Friday, run by Aisling Weaver) that helped me practise the process of writing regularly. They would provide people with a weekly prompt and the challenge was to write a piece of short erotic fiction which encompassed this prompt.\n\nI enjoyed doing that immensely, and after having a long talk with a friend of mine, she eventually suggested I write something to submit to a publisher. And so I did.\n\nWhat has been your favourite publishing experience this far?\nI\u2019ve loved all my publishing experiences so far, but I have to say that nothing tops that feeling when you get your very first acceptance letter in the mail. Or via email, as was the case for me.\n\nWhat is your favourite sexy\/dirty\/sweet\/raunchy word to use in your stories?\nI\u2019m going to sound really clich\u00e9, but it has to be \u201ccock\u201d. Or \u201cfuck\u201d. I\u2019m not much of a fan of other synonyms for penis, so cock has always been my go-to. Occasionally, a \u201cdick\u201d slips in, but that\u2019s rare. As for fuck, it\u2019s one of my favourite words to use in anything I do. Obviously not in my day job, but I do tend to slip in \u201cfuck\u201d into most of my sentences.\n\nYour blog occasionally features guest posts by other prominent erotica writers. How do you connect with them?\nThe UK has a very close-knit erotic writing community, and we see each other at events like Eroticon\u00a0and readings at several places. Business cards get given out, you follow people on Twitter and you make connections. So, mostly Twitter, with a bit of networking on the side.\n\nIf you could pick another writer to write the erotic story of your life, who would that be and what would the title be?\nI would quite like to have Charlotte Stein write the erotic story of my life. As for the title\u2026 The Girl Who Waited would be a cool one. Sort of a double meaning. One the one hand, you have the girl who waited for her chance in life, and on the other, it\u2019s a Doctor Who reference, so it\u2019s pleasingly geeky as well.\n\nWhat do you think the most significant differences are when trying to write erotic fiction and erotic poetry?\nHonestly, I\u2019m not really very good at writing poetry, so I don\u2019t think I can really give you a profound answer! I will say that writing erotic poetry is more challenging, because you\u2019ve got less time to convey what you want to convey. Poetry, to me, is something compact, so you\u2019ll have to come out swinging in what you\u2019ve written and carry that on until the end. Does that make any sense at all?\n\nHaving said that, I have incredible respect for people who are very good at erotic poetry.\n\nWhat can we look forward to from you in the future?\nI honestly don\u2019t know. I\u2019m up for anything people throw at me. But there will be lots of new writing to come, that\u2019s for sure. And maybe I\u2019ll finally get my arse in gear towards writing a novel.",

        "text":"Spanking interview with me at\u00a0ERWA\n\nOver at the Erotica Readers & Writers Association (THE website for anyone looking to write or read erotica), Ashley Lister interviewed me about Spanked and my writing process\/motivations:\n\nAshley Lister: Denise is an archetypical Rachel Kramer Bussel heroine in that she is self-aware and relates the story to the reader with layers of complex introspection that juxtapose cleverly against the physical aspect of the narrative. (I\u2019m thinking archetypical here in the same mould as your unnamed heroine from Doing the Dishes, Best Women\u2019s Erotica 04 and Mammoth Best New Erotica 4, and Marianne from Tight Squeeze in Rubber Sex). Why do you place such a strong emphasis on the psychological element of your characters?\n\nRachel: That\u2019s an interesting question, one I\u2019ve never really pondered before. Well, I think for one thing, dialogue is not my strong suit, so most of my stories are in the first person because that\u2019s the easiest way for me to get inside the characters\u2019 heads, and to tell the story.\n\nBut beyond that, I think at a very primal level, it\u2019s the psychology of both my lovers and characters in stories that turns me on. The fastest way to rope me in is to share something truly intimate, and when you do it in a story, I think it creates this bond with the reader. It shows them where the character is coming from and why whatever action is happening turns them on so much. To me one of the greatest things about spanking, as a topic and activity, is there there\u2019s such a vast range of motivations. You could watch, say, two men get spanked by two women. Both have their hands above their head, standing against a wall. Both women use the same black paddle. To an outsider, the scenes look the same, but maybe one is being \u201cpunished\u201d by his mistress, and maybe the other has never been spanked before, and is curious. Or maybe he\u2019s usually the top and they\u2019ve decided to switch.

        "text":"Friday, 24 February 2017\n\nFixation Friday - Featuring Jan Graham\n\nHi all! Fixation Friday time again, and today we have Jan Graham joining us. She's giving us the inside scoop on life as she knows it. Enjoy!\n\nYou write a range of genres including contemporary, BDSM, m\u00e9nage, romantic suspense and paranormal, which one do you like to write the most?\n\nMy favourite genre is romantic suspense, well for now anyway, lol. I like writing a complex story with lots of twists and turns along the way. I tend to combine genre\u2019s so my currently published romantic suspense stories have m\u00e9nage and BDSM elements to them but neither is the main thrust of the storyline, the suspense is. As for paranormal I do love to create worlds and I have taken down the original paranormal book I had on the market while I refine the series. Hopefully I\u2019ll be back into writing paranormal by next year, of course it will have an element of suspense to it.\n\nYou openly admit to being a sub, what is the most common misconception about the lifestyle that you\u2019ve experienced or heard?\n\nI think the biggest misconception is that BDSM is based on abuse, where a Dom can treat a sub any way they like and the sub has no say in it. That\u2019s so far from reality. Everything is negotiated and agreed upon, it\u2019s consensual and either party can walk away at any time. Also, not all BDSM involves being caned or flogged, pain doesn\u2019t have to be part of the dynamic, and in a lot of BDSM relationships it isn\u2019t.\n\nWhich one of your characters was the hardest for you to write and why?\n\nThe hardest character for me to write was Rhia from Playing Jax. Rhia is an ex nun and a virgin. I went to Catholic school as a kid, so the nun bit didn\u2019t really phase me, but it\u2019s been a loooonnng time since I was a virgin, so figuring out how forward Rhia should be and a few other traits associated with losing your virginity made me think. I ended up turning her into a woman determined to have sex, one who decided if she was embracing a new life outside the church then she needed to go all the way, so to speak, lol.\n\nWhat\u2019s the worst\/ best piece of advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nThis is the best piece of advice I\u2019ve ever received didn\u2019t really have anything to do with the writing world but it helped me write nonetheless. I had difficulty getting back into writing after my hubby passed away so, one day a friend sat down with me after I\u2019d been complaining how I couldn\u2019t write anymore and didn\u2019t know why, and she asked me a simple question - \u201cWhere is Shane in all this?\u201d I didn\u2019t get her at first, but after talking I realised that he\u2019d been with me for the other books I\u2019d written, I bounced ideas off him, let him read what I\u2019d written etc. After he\u2019d gone I removed all sign of him from my life, took down pictures and didn\u2019t mention him, because I didn\u2019t want to deal with the pain. My friend made me get a picture of him out of storage and I sat it on the desk in plain sight. After a few emotional days of staring at him I finally sat down to write and the words started to flow. I finished Switching Mercedes in record time and it remains one of my favourite works. I still have his picture in my work area.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge you\u2019ve had to overcome so far in your writing career?\n\nI think the biggest challenge has been finding a life\/writing balance. Working from home, it\u2019s so easy to give into interruptions. I can always find something else to do or somewhere else to go. I had to realise I needed to treat my writing like an everyday job, sit at the computer and work, schedule time off when needed but otherwise just say to family and friends \u201cI can\u2019t today, I\u2019m working\u201d. It\u2019s the only way to get the job done.\n\nWhat is something that a reader will find in your books that they won\u2019t find in others?\nI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m exclusive in this but I think readers will find an accurate portrayal of people in the BDSM lifestyle. They\u2019ll also find a glimpse into the Aussie character. I mean I can\u2019t write an Aussie hero or Dom without making him a bit of a larrikin.\n\nBesides writing and reading, what are your favourite things to do?\n\nI must admit that I have a Netflix addiction, so I do enjoy finding new series or movie to watch in my downtime. I also love going out with friends and just sitting, drinking coffee, and chatting. I do a little bit of jewellery making as well, but I\u2019m not great at it\u2026lol.\n\nTell us something about yourself that most people don\u2019t know.\n\nI hate being outside on really windy days, I find it hard to think and just want to go inside and hide.\n\nIf you could travel to anywhere in the world where would it be?\n\nProbably New York. I\u2019d love to go and see as many Broadway shows as possible.\n\nPolitical rally or rock concert? Which would you choose?\n\nA rock concert. Unless the political rally was something I felt passionate about and needed a groundswell of support.\n\nThank you for sharing with us today, Jan!\n\nJan's book, One Night in Sydney, is on sale at Amazon for 99 cents as part of the Tirgearr Publishing 5th birthday celebrations.\nCheck out the book below and go to Jan's blog post for more info on the birthday party. There are lots of prizes up for grabs.\n\nAbigail Devon is all about business, until the dream of keeping her company alive fails and she finds herself seeking distraction in the arms of a tempting stranger she met on the plane. Kane Matheson is a man like no other, and once Abby gives into her attraction to him, passions spark and a night of erotic pleasure begins.\n\nKane can\u2019t believe his luck when his flight to Sydney places Abby along his path to a fun filled weekend. She\u2019s his kind of woman\u2014business minded, clever, and with curves in all the right places. When he discovers they have more in common than savvy business expertise and undeniable sexual heat, he\u2019s faced with a daunting choice, and left wondering if pleasure can win out over wise business sense in one of the most beautiful harbour side cities of the world.\n\nWriting a bio that lets readers know who you are is tricky at times because I describe myself in so many ways. Like my books I fall into different genres, all of which depend on my mood and inspiration at the time. I am a writer, submissive, orphan, widow, sister, aunt, friend and sometimes, a wild child.\n\nMy writing currently falls under a variety of genres including BDSM, contemporary romance and romantic suspense but who knows where my literary future will lead. That\u2019s going to be the next exciting chapter.\n\nFollow Jan:\n\n1 comment:\n\n  1. Thanks for having me here today, JM. I hope your followers enjoyed the interview.\n\n\nThanks for visiting! I luurve to read comments. It might take a while for me to reply because, unless you're in Oz, I'm in a different timezone. I will reply. Have a great day\/ night!\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...",

        "text":"THE SEX FILES: We talk with the Queen of Lesbian Foot Worship KAYLA-JANE DANGER\n\nmalibu_5690v2Some people might think it\u2019s \u2018dangerous\u2019 to go from a Go-Go dancer, burlesque performer and fashion design and illustration student to the Queen of Lesbian Foot Worship and soft core sensual scenes. But in less than eight years, Kayla-Jane Danger has done it\u2026and without fear making fantasy into her real world. In her previous incarnation, Danger garnered the title \u201cMusic Video Honey\u201d and appeared in over 50 videos for world famous bands. Along with appearing on her own site MyDollParts.com that she runs, operates and makes exclusive content for, the girl next door with the ALT look has worked with Burning Angel and Sex Art, and has been photographed by legendary photographers Holly Randall and Ken Marcus for the multiple times she graced the pages of Hustler\u2019s Taboo.\u00a0I was lucky enough to talk to her about all this and more.\n\nAs the Queen of Lesbian Foot Worship, what have been your favorite foot scenes to either participate in or even just watch?\n\nI have a few favorites. \u201cLingerie Party\u201d featuring myself, Aiden Ashley and Elle Alexandra, and it\u2019s a silent story of sensual domination and worship, and a great story and very steamy scene! \u00a0I love \u201cWilling,\u201d which is a scene with me and Shyla Jennings, who sucks feet better than almost anyone I know, her mouth is like heaven and it\u2019s always a joy to have her juicy lips and crazy tongue wrapped around my toes!\n\nWhat other kinks do you enjoy other than foot\/leg worship and do you find what you look for in your off screen sex life is the same for what you look for on?\n\nI am a very dominant woman and generally take the dominant stance in my scenes, unless it happens to be a neutral scene with no dominant\/submissive play. In my personal life, I feel so lucky to have found a very compatible bedmate! He gives me everything I want, and things I never knew I wanted. Off screen, I always look for open-minded lovers, people who can accept my kinks and open their minds enough to try something they might not do otherwise.\n\nHas it always been your goal to coalesce all your websites under your KJD Media? Was this your long-term goal even from the beginning when starting a website?\n\nYes, I wanted to create my own world where I could workout, through success and failures, and explore my sexuality and the interests and fantasies of others.\n\nDo you see the adult business slowly morphing into a complete web based business? Do you think it might be actually at this point already?\n\nI hope not. I am actually on the cusp of releasing DVDs, because I know how many of my fans still subscribe to magazines and watch DVDs; they like the\u00a0collectability, and\u00a0they like tangible items. A large population of foot fetish porn consumers are older men, and many of those consumers aren\u2019t using the Internet, or are too wary to visit or join porn sites. After my appearances in Hustler\u2019s Taboo, Leg Show etc., I received a lot of fan mail to my PO Box from people who don\u2019t use the Internet and were hoping to see me in print or DVD soon (some even asked for VHS!!)\n\nDo you think fetish\/kink lends itself better to the web than DVD release?\n\nI think that\u2019s a common misconception. I think the nature of the amateur fetish production world, which is so\u00a0prevalent right now, and their \u201cclips\u201d or short scenes vs. feature format or longer more complete\u00a0vignettes\u00a0is a disservice to the genre. I prefer to tell stories, even in my shorter scenes, but I still make them complete, fully composed scenes. Part of why I want to start producing DVDs is all the feature length stories I have to tell that revolve around a person\u2019s foot fetish, lust, addiction, desire and exploration. Sometimes these stories cannot be told in short format or viewed properly on web. I also think that couples prefer DVDs due to their long format nature, rather than\u00a0masturbators\u00a0looking for short format beat-off material.\n\nCan you reveal some of the things you\u2019re planning for the future? And where can fans find you?\n\nI have so many plans for the future. I have just joined up with VIPnVegas to create VIP4Play, a membership program for Las Vegas VIP\u2019s to interact with the world\u2019s hottest adult stars!\n\nI am also putting out at least one vignette DVD and one feature this year in addition to hosting and performing in live lesbian foot worship cam shows. And last but definitely not least, I will be publishing an e-book entitled Pleasure or Pain, based on the screenplay by Zalman King!\n\nDo you have an opinion about Measure B and mandatory condom use in adult films?\n\nI think that it\u2019s ridiculous to require the use of condoms\/female condoms etc. to shoot porn. Performers currently use strict testing procedures making the sex they have on set far safer and generally cleaner than the sexual encounters of the general public. Performer\u2019s sign releases, waivers, and take the precautions and handle risks, so there is no reason for anyone else to be a part of the personal decisions of these performers to wear or not wear condoms, dental dams, etc.\n\nYou can find Kayla at\u00a0MyDollParts.comat Instagram and Twitter: @kjdangerdoll, and on her\u00a0Facebook fan page: facebook.com\/kaylajanedangeroffical.\n\nRelated Posts with Thumbnails\nStarbucks Whole Bean Coffee\n\nLeave a comment\n\nAdd your comment below, or trackback from your own site.

        "text":"My First Interview Courtesy of Slixa\u2019s After Dark Blog!\n\nOn by Isabel in Blog\n\nLovely peeps! I forgot to share that I had a fantastic interview a few months back with the wonderful Tizzy Wall about my work as a Provider photographer and the deals that I am offering to the Sex Worker community. The original article can be found here on Slixa\u2019s Undercover Blog, but I am going to go ahead and post the full interview here as well for your viewing pleasure!\n\nI am so so flattered and honored to photograph these beautiful individuals and even more flattered that people want to ask me questions about it! So without further ado, enjoy!\n\n\n\n\u00a0Interview: Provider Photographer Isabel Dresler\n\nFinding a good photographer is absolutely vital to a provider\u2019s business, and sometimes it can be incredibly tough. In nearly every city, there are at least a dozen so-called photographers who are actually just creepy dudes with a camera and a black sheet hung on their garage wall looking to perv on unsuspecting models. Finding a photographer who is not only a professional, but knows what providers really\u00a0need\u00a0for their business can be nearly impossible. That is, until you find Isabel Dresler.\n\nA few weeks ago, I hired Isabel to shoot some new work photos for me, and now I cannot believe I hadn\u2019t found her before. Working with Isabel was an absolute treat, and she provided some of the best photos I have ever had taken of me. Her body-positive attitude combined with her proactive, creative approach to working with models and photographic skill makes her the ultimate provider photographer (oh, and she offers some killer discounts too). She was generous enough to answer some questions about her perspective on her work and some tips on how to get\u00a0your\u00a0best photos. \u00a0Enjoy!\n\nHow did you get involved in photography? What kind of training do you have?\n\nI started dabbling in photography when I was probably seven or eight \u2013 I used to take my stuffed animals into the park and set up little photo shoots with my disposable camera. From there I started taking photos of bugs and pretty flowers, which I sold on awesome cardstock greeting cards, and then I got my first job working in a portrait studio in the mall for minimum wage. A few years ago I began working as a commercial\/product photographer and have been ever since, while also doing scientific photography \u2013 mostly insects and arachnids \u2013 and my first solo show was actually giant prints of adorable bugs. And, of course, I began photographing people\u2026 without clothes on\u2026 and yeah. Now I\u2019m here.\n\nHow did you get involved in shooting entertainers?\n\nI had dabbled in erotic art\/boudoir\/fetish photography for a little while, and then in 2010 I submitted some work to an erotic art show (which is a big deal, since my town is kinda small) and people liked it so much that I thought I might as well start trying to do more. I discovered early photographing people in intimate situations that I really enjoy building a relationship and creating a connection with my subject that makes them feel beautiful and unique and special. As I began being more active in the fetish community I met several entertainers and performers and politely asked them if I could take pretty naked pictures of them\u2026 And for some reason they said yes, and liked it, and told all their friends!\n\nWhat other kind of work do you do?\n\nOther work\u2026 hmm. I tried being a \u201csandwich artist\u201d for a couple months, but that didn\u2019t turn out so great. I also did a lot of work for my local watershed as a chemical and geography monitor, as well as benthic macroinvertebrate taxonomy, which I like to say because it\u2019s a total panty dropper. Basically, I sorted tiny water bugs for several hours a day and did population studies. It was rad. Now all I do is photography, photography and photography. It\u2019s not a bad way to live.\n\nHow do you plan your shoots?\n\nI love planning my sessions with my models, rather than on my own. Because so many of my clients tend to work creating experiences for others, it\u2019s really important for me to create an experience and a photoshoot catered to my subject, rather than for myself. I\u2019m pretty easily pleased, and I love seeing what other people want to create.\n\nYou\u2019ve shot with some pretty big name entertainers! Do you ever get nervous before a shoot? Have you ever been starstruck with any of your clients?\n\nI get nervous and starstruck before pretty much any shoot \u2013 I mean, beautiful wonderful amazing unique people are getting naked and vulnerable for me! That\u2019s a huge deal. I still get nervous before shooting people I\u2019ve shot loads of time \u2013 Serena Blair is one of my best friends, but even after all the sessions we\u2019ve had I still get butterflies every time. However, the one time I did get particularly \u201cstarstruck\u201d was the first time I photographed James Darling. He is fantastic, and so gorgeous, and just the epitome of charm. But yeah, any time I get to meet someone new and learn such awesome things about them and cultivate the relationship that I do is just so intense and fantastic and I love every minute of it. I\u2019m pretty good at pretending I\u2019m super chill and not nervous though, so that\u2019s good.\n\nThen again I guess everyone knows about my butterflies now though, soooo yeah.\n\nWhat I really love about your photography is how effortlessly you make everyone look fantastic, and after modeling for you, I know that a lot of it has to do with how you make the model feel at ease. Was that a skill that came naturally to you, or did you hone it over time? What do you feel is your best tool for creating that dynamic with your models?\n\nI don\u2019t think it really involved a lot of honing (heh heh, \u201choning\u201d), at least none that I did consciously\u2026 I think I get away with a lot of stuff because I\u2019m a girl (PATRIARCHY FOR THE WIN), i.e. telling ladies their breasts look epic fantastic or whatever, and joking about stuff to make them comfortable. I\u2019m pretty snarky, but for some reason people put up with it and even go so far to enjoy it. But when it comes down to brass tacks, it\u2019s not about getting lucky by only photographing attractive people. For me, everyone has something about them that is beautiful both physically and mentally and when I\u2019m photographing someone, that beauty is all I see \u2013 and I try to harness that beauty and convey it in my photographs so that they can see it, too. It makes me feel good, and it makes everyone else feel good, too. That\u2019s what really counts.\n\nAfter working with lots of different people, do you have any tips for entertainers on getting the best photos? What\u2019s the most common mistake you see models making?\n\nIt\u2019s easy for me to figure out what features or angles I want to highlight in a shoot, but sometimes it\u2019s not as easy for my subject \u2013 it\u2019s important to love all of yourself, but it\u2019s also important to figure out which styles, angles and lighting works best for you so that we can both create the best images that really highlight your best features. Also, don\u2019t be nervous. You\u2019re going to do great.\n\nSeeing how a picture is worth a thousand words, you can learn more about Isabel in pictorial form at her\u00a0website, or follow her more risque adventures over on her\u00a0blog. For the most intrepid 140 character updates, you can follow her on Twitter\u00a0@IsabelDresler.\n\nIf you are an entertainer interested in working with Isabel, consider her Performer\/Entertainer Package, which lists at $700 (four sessions at $175\/ea.). \u00a0Rather than pay $300 for a single session, entertainers and performers now have the option of signing up for the Seduction Package, which provides four discounted Seduction sessions over the course of twelve months for the investment of $700, or $175 per shoot, which can be paid all at once or in installments if necessary. \u00a0She also offers a smaller Performer\/Entertainer package of $400 for two shoots. \u00a0You can see her\u00a0other packages and single shoot prices\u00a0here.\u00a0 Contact her through her website for more details.",

        "text":"Hands with clay\n\n\u201cPersian Palm sex toys don\u2019t have to be hidden but can be part of the decor.\u201d\n\nThe Italian company Persian Palm specialises in ceramic toys that are created by hand, which is rather unusual given the level of sophistication industrial mass production has reached these days. But the philosophy of Persian Palm emphasises the personal touch, and the market seems to agree, as could be seen from Persian Palm\u2019s highly successful debut at eroFame 2016. EAN wanted to know which new projects the up-and-coming company from Tuscany has been working on since October, so we interviewed one of the two founders of Persian Palm, Eva Cincar.\n\n\nEAN first introduced its readers to Persian Palm ceramic toys in September of 2016. I know you were at last year\u2019s eroFame, but what else have you been up to in the meantime? What are the latest developments at Persian Palm?\nEva: After eroFame, we participated at a few fairs in Italy, however, they were not specific fairs for the adult industry; one was a fair for women\u2019s handcraft and another for environmentally sustainable products. Both were very interesting for us, because it was the first time that we presented our brand to Italian customers.\n\nOur products were even displayed at Arte Fiera in Bologna, and also at the design fair in Milan, which was a very satisfying experience for us. We also finished our new website, so now Persian Palm can also be found online. We started a collaboration with different retailers in Italy, Europe, and even in the USA, with different shops that are focussing on artisan and design items.\n\nEva Cincar\nEva Cincar is one of the founders of Persian Palm\n\nYour ceramic toys are created by hand, which is a rarity in today\u2019s market. How did the international adult industry respond to your products at last year\u2019s eroFame?\nLast year at eroFame, we were one of the few producers who offered something different: handmade, artistic sex toys. The visitors of eroFame were very excited, and most everybody whi visited our stand had a reaction like: \u201cWow! This is really different! Finally, a sex toy that should not be hidden, but can be in plain sight \u201c\u2026.exactly what we wanted to hear! Because our goal is to produce something that can be shown without shame, an artistic ornament that also happens to be a perfectly functional sex toy.\n\nWere you approached primarily by retailers, or did you also get in touch with distributors?\nMostly, we are working with retailers, erotic boutiques, and shops that are selling designer items. Obviously, if we can find a distributor who appreciates and understands products such as ours, we would be ready to enter into a collaboration.\n\nWhich new products have been added to your product line throughout the past months?\nWe have introduced some new decorations, but soon, there will also be a new line of Persian Palm sex toys; it will be a baseline collection, a bit simpler, but still in line with the philosophy that we will do not abandon! An artistic product, handmade, a bit simplified in its decorations and packaging, all in order to offer the best Persian Palm sex toys at a lower price.\n\nWould you mind explaining the advantages of using ceramic for sex toys? Why is this material so well-suited for creating dildos, etc.?\nSo, let\u2019s start from beginning: Ceramic is a material that has been used by humans in everyday life since the dawn of civilization; indeed, its discovery in the neolithic age was the beginning of civilisation as we know it today. This material has been used, with the same intensity, for 12.000 years!\n\nCeramic is well-suited for creating sex toys because it is a hard material and given the right shape, it helps stimulate the desired points. It is a very safe material; if it falls down, it will not break, unlike sex toys made of glass. It can be warmed up or cooled down for different sensations. The enamels and colours used in the decoration are completely safe for use \u2013 as a matter of fact, they are the same used for plates and mugs from which we eat and drink. Enamels make our sex toys completely non-porous, so they are easy to clean.\n\nBasically, it is no different than cleaning your dishes! It is enough to just wash and dry them. Persian Palm sex toys are designed to be both, beautiful decorations that you don\u2019t have to hide, and at the same time perfectly functional sex toy. Last but not least, there is the possibility to personalise the toys. We are able to produce sex toys with customised decorations, a possibility that only ceramic and maybe a handful of other materials allow; we can decorate our toy the way a customer wants, with images, colours, or lettering, and more and more people have been asking for these decorations. They want a truly personal item, and that item happens to be a sex toy!\n\nCeramic Dildo\nAn example of how Persian Palm sex toys can be customised to meet customer requests\n\nThere is a tangible trend in the adult industry as more and more consumers demand sustainability, resource protection, and eco-friendly production. Are your products in line with this trend?\nAbsolutely yes. To produce a Persian Palm sex toy, we only use clay, water, fire, and completely safe colours, without heavy metals. Even the current packaging is a box made of recycled cardboard.\nThe whole production is done in Tuscany, our suppliers are craftsmen and not the big industries. We are happy to involve those artisans who have been doing their job with passion for many years, using their hands and not just machines.\n\nDo you think that hand-made products in general will benefit from this trend? Could this be something like a counter-movement to this world of industrial mass production?\nHandmade products surely help the sustainability trend, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a counter-movement, it\u2019s just one segment of the whole adult industry. The handmade product is a more personal product than a vibrator made in an industrial way.\n\nEven if the customer buys a Persian Palm sex toy that has a standard, non-custom decoration, this customer still gets a product that is unique, because it is handmade, and it is a product on which artisans worked for hours; a product which reflects its creator\u2019s personal touch, and we can always tell them apart by these little, unique subtleties. It is a much more personal relationship with the customer. When it comes to mass production, it is very likely that no hand ever touched the toy. That is the fundamental difference.\n\nBut again, there are two different things. Our competitor is not and will never be the mass manufacturer. We have two roads going in the same direction, but they are and will always be two different roads.\n\nOther than the materials, what else sets your products apart from the competition?\nFirst of all, we the don\u2019t consider the other sex toys producers as competition but more as a resource, because we are on the same path, and surely together we can have more strength to foster our market segment. What sets us apart from other sex toys producers is, first and foremost, that our toys are art objects. Then, there is the fact that we can offer sex toys with individual decorations, and there are not many other materials that allow for this kind of personalisation. Persian Palm sex toys don\u2019t have to be hidden but can be part of the decor.\n\nPersian Palm\nThe Persian Palm team do not consider hand-made toys a counter-movement to mass production, but rather one of several options within the industry\n\nHow are your products positioned in the market? Would you say they\u2019re in the luxury segment? A niche segment maybe?\nOur product is a bit of both. It is a luxury product because it is an art object \u2013 because we use precious materials for decorations and especially because to produce them, we use the most valuable resource we have, time. But at the same time, it is a niche product because it is not a sex toy for everyone. It is for the consumer who doesn\u2019t look just for a simple sex toy. It is for the consumer who, apart from looking for a functional sex toy, also appreciates the art, the tradition, the history, and the necessary time that went into the creation of this toy.\n\nAnd who buys your products? Who is the target audience for Persian Palm toys?\nOur end-customer, like I told before, is the person who can appreciate the artistic value of our products. Usually, Persian Palm sex toys are not the first sex toy they purchase, but the next step in their evolution of using sex toys.\n\nIf we are talking about retailers that carry Persian Palm, we usually work with erotic boutiques which sell specialised pleasure objects, and not just objects from mass production. In the last few months, we have seen an increasing interest in Persian Palm products from retailers who are focussing on general design and art items, not even necessarily sex toys.\n\nWhat are your plans for the rest of the year?\nOur main plan is developing the new line of Persian Palm sex toys I mentioned before, and at the moment, we are working on that. Then, we hope to return to eroFame, a fair that helped us a lot to start our adventure in the world of adult industry.",
