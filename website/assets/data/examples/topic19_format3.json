        "text":"Request an Event\n\nThank you for visiting our website. If your organization is interested in scheduling an astronomy-related presentation or viewing event, please use the form below to submit your request. We will review the request and respond within 3-5 days.\n\nIMPORTANT \u2013 Please read:\n\nFor outdoor events choose an evening when the moon is new or near its first quarter. Scheduling an event near or during a full moon is not recommended because the view through a telescope is overwhelmingly bright, and the bright light of the moon hides many other interesting objects in the night sky. In general, dates that fall within +\/- four days of a full moon are poor choices and should be avoided.\n\nSchedule the event to allow for viewing times at least 1-2 hours after sunset. Although the moon may be in the afternoon sky, if the event starts before sunset and ends at dusk, there will be very little for guests to see. This is especially important in the late Spring when days are getting long and sunset is often near 9 PM.\n\nSafety is always a consideration, but the darker the viewing area the better. Select a viewing spot where telescopes can be set up in a level, open area away from large floodlights, or if possible arrange with maintenance staff to turn off the lighting for that particular evening. Make sure irrigation sprinkler systems are not active during the time of the event! Choose an area accessible to cars. Cover any flashlights with red plastic (a red balloon works well) secured with a rubber band. This will allow eyes to adjust to their natural night vision. Once our eyes are accustomed to the available ambient light, very little additional light is needed.\n\nPlease submit requests a minimun of 45 days before the planned event to allow sufficient time to request volunteer astronomers to support\u00a0the event.\n\nComplete this form to request and schedule our participation in a lecture or viewing event. If you are seeking answers to a general question, please use our General Contact form.\n\n* indicates required field\n\n\nAcceptable file types: doc,docx,pdf,txt,gif,jpg,jpeg,png.\nMaximum file size: 2mb.",

Unfortunately, if the ligand and receptor used to set up the job were distinct included entries, the ligand is treated as a separate \"receptor\" instead of part of a ligand-receptor complex that must be extracted the during initial Glide docking stage. This causes failures in the initial Glide stage.\n\nThis is likely to be the problem if the jobname.log file reports that the \"Number of initial structures\" is more than one. The initial docking stage prints a warning about missing _pv.mae files and the IFD job stops. Error messages indicative of this problem are a \"ZeroDivisionError: float division\" message in the jobname_rec-N_*.log file or errors reading the receptor structure in the jobname_rec-N_*_grid.out or jobname_rec-N_*_dock.out files.\n\nTo avoid this problem, merge the ligand and receptor into single entry in the Project Table, and include only that new entry in the Workspace when setting up the IFD job.\n\nKeywords: Induced fit docking, multiple structures\n\nBack to Search Results\n\nWas this information helpful?\n\nWhat can we do to improve this information?\n\nTo ask a question or get help, please submit a support ticket or email us at\nKnowledge Base Search\n\nType the words or phrases on which you would like to search, or click here to view a list of all\nKnowledge Base articles",

Tree wilt diseases: Collect several branches \u00bd to 1 inch in diameter and about 12 inches long. The samples should be in the process of wilting but not dead.\n  3. Trees\/shrubs (foliage diseases, cankers, and fruit rots): Collect several branches 10-12 inches long (or fruit) showing a range of symptoms.\n  4. Turf: Samples should be 6 inches square by 4 inches deep. Collect the sample near the margin of the affected area so that a range of diseased and healthy tissue is included.\n\n\n  1. Diagnostic sampling for initial detection of a nematode problem: Separate samples from healthy and affected areas are essential for a reliable diagnosis of nematode damage. Collect several soil and root cores to a depth of 6 to 8 inches from the margin of the affected area. The soil cores should be bulked, mixed, and subsampled. Repeat the sampling process nearby in the healthy area. Submit 1 pint of soil and roots. Include the plants if possible.\n  2. Advisory sampling for management purposes (for soybean cyst):\n    Collect samples prior to planting. Divide the field into sections based on soil type and cropping history. From each section collect at least five soil cores taken at a depth of 6 to 8 inches. The soil cores should be bulked, mixed, and subsampled. Submit 1 pint of soil.\n  3. Sampling for pine wilt:\n    Collect a branch at least 2 inches in diameter and 6 to 8 inches long from adjacent to the trunk of the tree. Place sample in plastic bag immediately after collection and keep cool until shipping. Do not add water to the sample. Mail early in the week (Monday \u2013 Wednesday). Allow 1-2 weeks for a reply.\n\nThere will be a $5.00 diagnostic surcharge per plant or cost of individual test fee ($10 to $20).\nSamples not submitted through the County extension office will have a additional overhead surcharge.\nDistance diagnostics \u2013 no charge.",

Keck Foundation.\u00a0 The initiative builds on three pillars of vital and sustained research: interdisciplinary encounters that counterbalance specialization and isolation; the formulation of new questions; and communication bridging scientific divides, habits of thought, and institutions.\u00a0 Toward these goals, the multifaceted National Academies Keck Futures Initiative incorporates three core activities each year: Futures Conferences, Futures Grants, and the National Academies Communication Awards.\u00a0 NAKFI is an important component of the pursuit of discovery that President Obama has said is necessary to fuel our prosperity and success as a nation for the next 50 years.\n\nFutures Grants provide seed funding to Collective Behavior: From Cells to Societies Conference participants who are at U.S.-based institutions, on a competitive basis, to enable further pursuit of important new research and other activities stimulated by the conference, bringing people together in a variety of new ways and sparking new research.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese grants are intended to provide researchers seed money to go further and take larger next steps in developing a line of inquiry by supporting activities such as the involvement of students and post docs to the research effort, the purchase of equipment, and the acquisition of preliminary data \u2013 which will position them to compete for larger awards from other sources.\u00a0\nThese grants emphasize flexibility and freedom; applicants are encouraged to think \u201coutside the box\u201d in determining how they would utilize the award to make a positive difference in research related to the conference topic, interdisciplinary collaboration and their careers.\u00a0 Creative proposals that focus on the \u201cnewest\u201d science or ideas are encouraged.\u00a0 Grant requests can involve interdisciplinary collaboration at one institution or across multiple institutions.\u00a0 All applications must show how they are related to ideas generated at the The Future of Advanced Nuclear Technologies Conference.\u00a0\nGrant proposal examples include (but are not limited to):\n  \u2022 Two research groups have a unique line of research related to The Future of Advanced Nuclear Technologies that they want to pursue jointly, but cannot apply for other funding because there are no preliminary data.\u00a0 The researchers apply for a Futures Grant as seed money to support interdisciplinary research in this area, to acquire preliminary data in order to compete for larger awards from other sources.\n  \u2022 Members of an assigned Interdisciplinary Research Team or iDEA Group from The Future of Advanced Nuclear Technologies Conference want to continue their group\u2019s discussions at a researcher\u2019s lab for a week during the summer.\u00a0 In addition, they want to include a physicist, behavioral psychologist, and expert in energy systems, because their expertise is needed to help with the next steps of the discussion.\u00a0 The group requests funding to support the meeting (travel, lodging, food, lab supplies, etc.).\n  \u2022 A public policy expert and engineer who met at the conference want to explore collaboration opportunities related to The Future of Advanced Nuclear Technologies.\u00a0 They also wish to include a radiation expert in these discussions.\u00a0 The researchers apply for a Futures Grant to support travel to each other\u2019s labs, to learn more about each other\u2019s work, and to explore potential collaborations.\u00a0\n  \u2022 A biologist and an robotics engineer at different institutions want to support a graduate student for a year to begin a new joint research project, in order to make progress and explore a larger collaboration between the groups.\u00a0 They request funding to support the student for a year and his\/her travel between the groups.",

        "text":"Outdoor Warning Sirens\n\nAbout the Sirens\n\nThe Sirens are activated from McLean County Emergency Management Agency (EMA), with a backup at MetCom. EMA has a network of trained weather spotters that are activated when severe weather conditions arise. The Bloomington Fire Department supplies one of these spotters and this person is positioned on the upper floors of State Farm's Downtown Building. Normal Fire Department has a spotter on the top floor of Watterson Towers on ISU Campus. These spotters, in conjunction with ground spotters and other emergency resources communicate with MetCom and EMA.\n\nTypically reports of funnel clouds are verified by a spotter or other creditable agency representative before the sirens are activated. It is important to realize that during a severe weather incident like this, it is typical to get hundreds of reports of funnel clouds all over our community. It is important that these are confirmed, as most of these reports turn out to be negative. If the sirens were activated for any report, you would find that they would be sounding constantly through an entire thunderstorm event. This would make them ineffective as people would ignore the warning.\n\nThe agreed upon approach is that the sirens are to be used to alert citizens who are outdoors during the imminent hazard and prompt them to seek additional information on the threat (timing, location, and severity) to allow sufficient time to seek proper sheltering.\n\nActivations Conditions\n\nSiren activation recommended for:\n  \u2022 Tornado Warning -- Issued by the National Weather Service or Tornado or funnel cloud indicated on radar, reported by a trained spotter (Law Enforcement, Fire Department or Emergency Management officials).\n  \u2022 Severe Thunderstorm Warning -- Issued by the National Weather Service and Winds 70 mph or greater forecast or occurring.\nThere will NEVER be an \"All Clear\" signal from the outdoor warning sirens. People in or near the warned area should then monitor reliable sources such as NOAA All-Hazards Radio or local media services to know when the threat has dissipated.\n\nRemember: Outdoor warning sirens are there to warn people OUTDOORS -- Outdoor warning sirens are designed for alerting people outside their homes and away from other media sources of imminent danger from an approaching storm. It is designed to warn these people outside to take cover immediately. The sirens are not designed as a consistent warning system for persons inside of structures.\n\nWhile sirens can be heard inside, there are a variety of factors that can influence someone's ability to hear the siren, such as topography, obstructions between the siren and the structure, construction of the building or residence, other noise sources (TV, radios, hail, wind, etc), and distance from the siren. The City of Bloomington has 19 outdoor warning sirens, Normal has 11 and Bloomington Township has 1 at Crestwicke. The sirens are designed to have a 1.5 mile coverage area based on the decibel level per the manufacturer. When EMA determines that siren activation is necessary, all sirens in the system are activated. We do not activate sirens in specific areas only.\nIndividuals are responsible for monitoring conditions for their personal safety. The National Weather Service has created a warning system that consists of Watches and Warnings for a variety of weather conditions to keep people informed. These informational watches and warnings are broadcast over TV and radio. When weather systems approach, people should monitor either TV or radio to keep up to date on the conditions. Weather alert radios are designed to receive broadcasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) thru the National Weather Service (NWS). These devices only broadcast weather information and are a valuable tool for monitoring severe conditions and are available in both desktop and portable units.\n\nIt is also important for individuals to understand the NWS Warning system. A Watch (Severe Thunderstorm or Tornado) means that conditions are right for these type of storms to occur. During a watch, people should monitor conditions and be prepared to take shelter. A Warning means that the severe weather is occurring in the area (Thunderstorm or Tornado) at this time, people should seek shelter immediately. People should not wait until the sirens are activated or a tornado is actually sighted in their specific area as this is too late. A Warning is the time when people need to be in a protected place monitoring conditions until they improve and the situation passes.\n\nMonthly Testing\n\nAs with any system, some failures do occur. We test the warning sirens once a month, on the first Tuesday at 10:00am. If there is inclement weather, the test will be postponed or cancelled. The redundancy of the system allows for outdoor users to hear sirens even when one closer may not sound, but this is also why it may not be heard indoors.",
