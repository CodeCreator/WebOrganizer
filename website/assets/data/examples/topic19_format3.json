Click here for more information.\n\nElsevier also encourages authors to cite any data that they use in a proper way, so that researchers can more easily find data behind scientific claims and so that proper credit is given to those contributing data. In support of this, Elsevier endorses the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles, which gives further guidelines on how to cite data.\n\n\u2039 Return to Policies and Guidelines",
