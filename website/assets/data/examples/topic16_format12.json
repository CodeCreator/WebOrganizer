Courtesy Mike Ashley et al., our magazine has become listed in the online SF-Encyclopedia with at least one entry: Deep Outside SFFH later Far Sector SFFH 1998-2007. There is also a stub pointing to this link from Outside: Speculative & Dark Fiction, our initial publication name on 15 April 1998 before threats of a law suit from a backpacking magazine. Brian and I then came up with the new name Deep Outside as a compromise. We soon added SFFH for SEO and as a concept sharpener.\n\nIn the course of our ten year run, we* published many talented newcomers, a few of whom went on to Nebula, Hugo, and other major awards or nominations. We also published at least one Nebula Award recipient (the late Pat York), and at least two SFWA officers including Linda Dunna and Dr. Andrew Burt. With the folding of Ellen Datlow's Event Horizon in the fall of 1998, we became the world's oldest web-only magazine without print antecedents, paying SFWA professional rates and following all their rules for a professional organization, until we ended our run in early 2007. By *we, I include such dedicated staffers as A. L. Sirois, Dennis Latham, John K. Muir, and Shaun Farrell. Brian (and Gwen Callahan, who had helped read submissions) left me as sole proprietor in 2001, at which point I kept the magazine but changed its name to Far Sector SFFH (which happened to be a domain name I had recently acquired and wasn't sure what to do with, though I really liked it and still do). We had changed Clocktower Fiction to Clocktower Books, and I became sole proprietor of the publishing house as well (Clocktower Books ISBN prefix 0-7433).\n\nMike Ashley, historian of 20th Century SFFH Magazines. I have been in touch with Mike Ashley (prominent U.K. anthologist and researcher) over the past few years. He is, among other things, the editor of many Mammoth anthologies. Mike's impressive projects include a signature history of 20th Century SFFH magazines in four volumes, his Story of the Science Fiction Magazines series. Mike originally sought me out a few years ago as he was beginning to plan the fourth and last volume, yet to be released from University of Liverpool Press at this writing (11 July 2014). He is an astute and detailed researcher, and had already done his homework well. He had found us (Deep Outside SFFH, Far Sector SFFH, Clocktower Fiction) on The Wayback Machine among other references (The SF Magazine in Canada; John Labovitz' list from the 1990s; and more). Recently, we pieced together, as best we could from my old notes and folders, a history of this magazine (1998-2007). I will add more notes to this update, but it appears that we are finally going to be on the historical map. Presumably, that means we can soon have a Wikipedia page as well, which should open up a link section to Clocktower Books as well. This is just one of several positive things that are happening this year to put Clocktower Books better on the map. We became a recognized publisher of International Thriller Writers (ITW) in 2009. Mike Ashley's will undoubtedly be the final, comprehensive, and definitive history of SFFH magazines in the 20th Century, and our magazine helps end the final chapters in that saga as the Internet age started breaking open in the late 1990s. More info to follow soon.\u2014JTC\n\nMuseum (Original 2010 Info Below)\n\nSide Notes\n\nJohn T. Cullen has been online since early 1996, joining the early Web pioneers in publishing exciting stories in several fields. On these pages, in March 2010, we begin to gather as much of the old work that has not been lost by time, computer crashes, upgrades, fatigue, and neglect over the years.\n\nPast web endeavors with founding years (as best able to recollect) include Neon Blue Fiction (1996), The Haunted Village (1996), Clocktower Fiction (1997), SharpWriter.Com, Clocktower Books (1998).\n\nAs to the web magazine, it began as Outside: Speculative & Dark Fiction (April 15, 1998), quickly morphed to Deep Outside SFFH (late 1998 to late 2001), and finally Far Sector SFFH (late 2001 to January 2007). Most of the art work on the first two versions was done by Brian Callahan (, who was my business partner until his departure for other green pastures in 2001. After that, much artwork came from A. L. Sirois and some from myself.\n\nBrief Aside by JTC. Reality, technology, truth, and progress are sending the New York City ('Big Six') publishing anomaly's self-ordained and mercenary gatekeepers packing. Early on, many of us saw that the Internet was a unique new publishing opportunity. This is not because we are unintelligent, or amateurs, or heretics, or the unclean whose trivial and ridiculous scribblings have not been blessed by the high priests and their acolytes in akad\u00afme, and so forth. Quite the opposite will eventually dawn on even the dimmest of bulbs. Many of us have multiple degrees, often quite relevant. My three are a BA in English (Univ of Connecticut), a BBA in Computer Information Systems (National University), and an MS in Business Administration (Boston University). I am a professionally trained editor, journalist, author, and scholarly researcher. Many of us have years of professional experience in writing, editing, journalism, book editing, and various other disciplines. In other words, some of us, at least, bring the highest professional standards to the work we create online. Many of us are far better educated and knowledgeable than many of the gatekeepers of cheap, sentimental trash that New York typically purveys. How many of their books of the last 40 years, since the advent of shopping malls and big box stores, will survive to still be read in the classrooms of 2212 or 2412? Given that they have literally owned the entire industry, vertically and horizontally, we may expect that a few literary works got through the censorship and gatekeeping\u2014but not enough to justify their self-adulation.\n\nI remember seeing a survey in The Los Angeles Times (remember them?) around the early 2000s. Most of the respondents (authors, editors, etc in the print industry) tended to think the Internet and digital publishing had no future. One or two still vocally railed against the idea that one would sell print books on line through retailers like Amazon. Stories of such shortsightedness and lack of vision abound. They are not worth mentioning in detail, because they are all dreck that has already run over by the wheels of progress. You can imagine similar outrage among the monks of the scriptorium when Gutenberg used moveable type to grind out Bibles. Does anyone remember the loathing among publishers (which lasted for decades, and still echoes even today) when Betty and Ian Ballantyne revived the Liberty Book (softcover, in WW2 rationing) and created the paperback in the late 1940s\u2014which was anathema to the shamans and their acolytes of the publishers in boards. Ironically, they who speak of 'hardcovers' have not produced a true hardcover in over half a century. A real book between boards, hand-stitched in an antique wooden machine, entirely by hand, has not been manufactured in popular quantities in nearly a century by now. For all the drama and the posing, modern 'hardcovers' are really nothing more than paperbacks glued together between cardstock or cardboard. In fact, even the 'trade paperback' is really no more than a cardback that has come unglued.\n\nIn the long term, reality and the free market place will determine the outcome of the current death and birth struggles. Only a few years ago, in a survey of publishing and writing professionals by The Los Angeles Times (remember them?), there were still several people who loathed and condemned the new practice of selling print works online via and other retail sites. There remains to this day a vast horde of [censored] who keep insisting that everything online should be free, including tens of thousands of hours of hard work and sacrifice by dedicated and talented writers and musicians. If many of these artists online do not meet the standards of their'onors, the [censored], then we may well recall that most of the print industry's output ends up being remaindered for failure to sell. But again, discussions like this are pointless.\n\nWhat is Traditional Publishing? In 2011, I did some studies for an online publication. I found several truths. First, most great authors (meaning that their work transcends their time and culture, and is read generations later by an avid public) had to self-publish because of the mediocrity and myopia of their era's gatekeepers. This includes writers like Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman (who was a trained typesetter and printer), Virginia Wolfe (who owned her own press), D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Erma Rombauer, Zane Grey, Beatrix Potter, Anais Nin, Stephen Crane, and entirely too many great authors to name. They fill up much of the syllabus of the typical literature department whose hierophants despise 'vanity' publishers. If only they had a clue. Secondly, I could plainly see that the Big Six (or is it Five by now, or Four, as they collapse one by one?) is not the so-called 'traditional publishing' of which people so vacantly-eyed speak. The real traditional publishing, in the United States of John Peter Zenger, press freedom, and the First Amendment, consists of over 40,000 small press publishers who have survived the now moribund big-box, shopping mall industry of the New York City cartel. But make no mistake\u2014I don't loathe them, because I am a business person as they are. I just hope to do it smarter and better. Time will tell. With their unholy monopoly broken by the new freedoms of digital publishing, anyone has a fair shot now. With the gatekeepers sent packing, the world's James Joyces and Wal... (truncated)",

        "text":"Comma Press\n\nComma\u2019s Mission is to put the short story at the heart of contemporary narrative culture. Through innovative commissions, collaborations and digital initiatives, we will explore the power of the short story to transcend cultural and disciplinary boundaries, and to enable greater understanding across these boundaries.\n\nOur Aims are:\n\n  1. To commission and publish new short fiction in a way that demonstrates the potential of the form, and speaks to the diversity of perspectives that make up contemporary England.\n  2. To create opportunities for emerging and established authors to develop, as writers, and to share their work in new contexts, be these interdisciplinary, intercultural, or digital.\n  3. To develop new and diverse audiences for literary short fiction, and new ways for these audiences to access, experience, and interact with it, as well as with each other.\n  4. To support the wider publishing ecology for literary fiction, throughout England, creating new opportunities for translators, editors, and other publishing professionals to enter and prosper in the industry, where those opportunities are often geographically or socially biased.\n\nComma\u2019s award-winning publications include collections by new and established authors, interdisciplinary collaborations between authors and scientists, and translation commissions devised to identify cutting-edge (often marginalized) voices from across the world.\n\n\nThe Sea Cloak\n\nDrawing from her own experiences of growing up in a Syrian refugee camp, as well as her current life in Gaza, these 14 stories by author, journalist and women\u2019s rights campaigner Nayrouz Quarmout stitch together a patchwork of different perspectives into what it means to be a woman in Palestine today.\n\nThe Book of Havana\n\nThis anthology brings together ten stories by Havana-based authors, offering different perspectives on a city that has stood in defiance of much of the rest of the world for decades.\n\nThe Book of Riga\n\nThe Book of Riga brings together ten short stories written about and from the capital of Latvia, showcasing the work of some of the country\u2019s most well-known, and exciting emerging writers.\n\nBanthology: Stories from Unwanted Nations\n\nOn 27 January 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting all refugee admissions for 120 days and temporarily barring entry from seven Muslim-majority countries. Mass protests followed, and the order has since been blocked, revised and challenged by judges, activists and artists alike.\n\nThis urgent and timely collection brings together seven specially commissioned stories from the so-called \u2018banned nations\u2019. Written in response to Trump\u2019s ban, it showcases new works by previously unplatformed writers, exploring the emotional and personal impact of all restrictions on movement \u2013 both existing restrictions and potential future bans.\n\nThe Book of Tbilisi\n\nThe Book of Tbilisi brings together ten short stories written about and from the Georgian capital, showcasing the work of some of the country\u2019s most exciting and decorated contemporary writers.\n\nRefugee Tales II\n\nModelled on Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, the second volume of Refugee Tales sets out to communicate the experiences of those who, having sought asylum in the UK, find themselves indefinitely detained. Here, poets and novelists create a space in which the stories of those who have been detained can be safely heard, a space in which hospitality is the prevailing discourse and listening becomes an act of welcome.\n\nConradology: A Celebration of the Work of Joseph Conrad\n\nTo mark his 160th birthday, 14 authors and critics from Britain, Poland and elsewhere have come together to celebrate the literary legacy of Joseph Conrad with new pieces of fiction and non-fiction.\n\nLetters Home\n\nMartyn Bedford\u2019s short stories ask a difficult the question: how do we re-define ourselves in the age of identity politics and social media echo-chambers. What constitutes personal identity, and what can we call \u2018home\u2019, when the places we come from are either no-longer accessible, or not what they claim to be\n\nYou Should Come With Me Now\n\nFrom gelatinous invaders from the astral plane to siblings at loggerheads because of preferences over pets \u2026 These are weird stories for weird times. In an age that is both \u2018bland and rotten\u2019 the only glimpses of respite lie in delusion.\n\nFrom Professor Murasaki\u2019s Notebooks on the Effects of Lightning on the Human Body\n\nA John Latham poem is a like a precipitation: images coalesce around a single memory the way ice crystallises around the smallest particle to form a snowflake; the strange logic that constructs them is unique each time. And as the title poem demonstrates, every last atom of detail, even the mistakes of a makeshift translation, has the capacity to beguile.\n\nProtest: Stories of Resistance\n\nWhen does a riot become a revolution? When does a demonstration of dissent tip over into a moment of unstoppable political change? This book asks 20 authors and 20 historians to bring crucial moments of British protest to life.\n\nIraq +100\n\n10 Iraqi writers were asked: what do you think your country will look like in 2103, 100 years after the disastrous American- and British-led invasion? Iraq + 100, named one of the best SF and Fantasy Books of 2016 in The Guardian.\n\nRefugee Tales\n\nPoets and novelists \u2013 including Booker shortlisted and award winning authors - retell the real stories of anonymous refugees, held in the UK under indefinite detention.\n\nIn Another Country\n\nWidely regarded as the master of short stories, this collection brings together David Constantine\u2019s best work from his four collections with Comma, including \u2018In Another Country\u2019, the story which inspired the Oscar nominated film 45 Years.\n\nDrone Eats With Me: stories from a city under fire\n\nOne of the few voices to make it out of the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip in 2014 was that of Atef Abu Saif, whose eye-witness accounts offered a rare window into the conflict for Western readers.\n\nJebel Marra\n\nHere, Michelle Green \u2013 a former aid worker in Darfur - re-tells the story of the 2004 Darfur war from 15 different perspectives, offering fictional yet moving, first-hand insights into a tragedy that disappeared from our headlines all too quickly.\n\nThe Book of Gaza\n\nThis anthology brings together some of the pioneers of the Gazan short story, with ten stories that offer glimpses of life in the Strip that go beyond the global media headlines; stories of anxiety, oppression, and violence, but also of resilience and hope, of what it means to be a Palestinian, and how that identity is continually being reforged; stories of ordinary characters struggling to live with dignity in what many have called 'the largest prison in the world'.\n\nThe Iraqi Christ\n\nA soldier with the ability to predict the future finds himself blackmailed by an insurgent into the ultimate act of terror\u2026 Fleeing a robbery, a Baghdad shopkeeper falls into a deep hole, at the bottom of which sits a djinni and the corpse of a soldier from a completely different war\u2026\n\nTea at the Midland\n\nThe characters in David Constantine\u2019s fourth collection are often delicately caught in moments of defiance. Constantine\u2019s bewitching, finely-wrought stories give us permission to escape.\n\nContact Info\n\nRa Page\nManaging Editor and CEO (+44) 7792564747\n\nBecky Harrison\nEngagement Manager\n\nComma Press on Twitter",

We are a group of bookworms and diverse book bloggers aiming to uplift Asian voices in literature. Due to the support and appreciation that followed both #AsianLitChat and #AsianLitBingo, we wanted to create a space to share more books and discussion related to literature by Asian authors. And thus, Lit CelebrAsian was born!\n\nWe want to highlight Asian voices through features and annual events that are open to all readers. Beyond Asian representation, on social media, we aim to boost the many different marginalized voices, platforms and communities with similar goals towards equality in publishing.\n\nOur Events\n\nThe Lit CelebrAsian Book Club\n\nThe Lit CelebrAsian Book Club is open to everybody. We host a book club poll on Twitter, so that readers can choose a book to read for the book club. Want to know more about which three books we\u2019re voting on for our first read? Check out our blog post that has the details on all three books. Vote for a book on our current book club poll here. The poll will close after 5 days. The chosen book alongside the book club chat date will be announced here and across all social media.\n\nAsian Lit Chat\n\nAsian Lit Chat will return as the book club chat on Twitter. Readers can participate in the book club chat at the end of the reading month by following the #AsianLitChat hashtag. If you miss the Twitter chat, you can drop by our Goodreads group discussion forums. We also plan to host Twitter chats about representation-related topics through #AsianLitChat later on, so stay tuned for updates. You can find our previous #AsianLitChat recaps here.\n\nAsian Lit Bingo\n\nAsian Lit Bingo will return next year as a fun annual reading challenge (created by Shenwei). It will feature special events in addition to a reading game-board challenge to support Asian voices. During this year\u2019s Asian Lit Bingo, we also did an interview series with several amazing authors.\n\nWhen we host Asian Lit Bingo during May heritage celebrations next year, we promise to pay equal focus to boosting Pasifika voices and spaces during this period too. Pasifika voices are continually erased during Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage month, so we encourage all readers to support\u00a0#Pasifika voices via\u00a0Our Stories \u2013 Tala mai le Moana\u00a0compiled by Lani Wendt Young, the Pasifika Book ClubPacific Islander AuthorsPasifika Tales and the\u00a0Pasifika Spotlight\u00a0hosted by\u00a0Alec Te Pohe.\n\nBehind The Name\n\nWe are excited to announce our new name: Literary CelebrAsian (a.k.a Lit CelebrAsian) formerly known as Lit InvAsian. Upon reflection, our team wanted a new name to clearly reflect our goals towards equality, celebration and inclusion. We\u2019re still fond of puns.\n\nOur former \u2018Lit InvAsian\u2019 name was a playful way to address false Yellow Peril Invasion perceptions in the Western context. Though we recently reflected upon our former name in relation to concerns around potential inter-Asian imperialistic connotations in the wider Asian historical context and decided that a new name, which celebrates Asian voices was needed to clearly convey our goals towards equality. We hope that you\u2019ll join us in uplifting Asian voices in literature.\n\nLit CelebrAsian Logo\n\nMany thanks to our collaborative design team \u2013 Kai, Aila and Aentee\u00a0\u2013 for designing our lotus book logo!\n\n*Introduction composed by Lit CelebrAsian team members: Sinead and Glaiza\n\n3 thoughts on \u201cIntroducing Literary CelebrAsian (a.k.a Lit\u00a0CelebrAsian!)\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.
