        "text":"History of CML\n\nChoice Magazine Listening was founded in 1962 by LuEsther T. Mertz, one of the original principals of Publishers Clearing House. Mrs. Mertz believed that visually impaired people and those with disabilities that prevented them from reading standard print should have access to the same magazine writing as sighted people. She established the nonprofit Lucerna Fund to support the efforts of Choice Magazine Listening. Because of LuEsther\u2019s foresight, this recorded magazine anthology has always been completely free of charge. Mrs. Mertz died in 1991 at age 85.\n\nThroughout its 55 years of service, Choice Magazine Listening has shared the finest magazine writing with its special audience. From an original source list comprised of five of LuEsther\u2019s favorite magazines, to the more than 100 distinguished magazines and literary journals that the editors read today, CML has consistently showcased the best current writing by the finest contemporary authors. Through selectively chosen poems, short stories, interviews, essays and in-depth nonfiction articles, read, unabridged, by talented narrators, the aim of CML has always been to expand the human mind: to inform, entertain and enlighten. Each 12-hour quarterly issue is an opus for the ear.\n\nTechnology and Format Changes\n\nThe National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, Library of Congress (NLS), was created in 1931 to provide library service to the blind. Based on the NLS model, the first issues of Choice Magazine Listening were recorded in 1962 on 16-2\/3 rpm records, a special format developed to ensure protection of copyrighted material in accordance with the Pratt-Smoot Act of 1931. In 1996 the Chafee Amendment, which provided an exemption from the requirement to obtain copyright permission under certain conditions, was passed by Congress. As the NLS has updated its specially formatted technology, so too has Choice Magazine Listening, which switched to 8 rpm flexible discs in 1978, 4-track cassette tapes in 1990 and digital talking-book cartridges in 2011. In addition, listeners who use a computer can now download CML.\n\n\nChoice Magazine Listening is currently celebrating its 55th anniversary. Three editors, a webmaster\/circulation manager, and an office manager currently staff the offices in Port Washington, NY. CML led the way in the early transition to digital talking-book cartridges for magazines, offering subscribers the highest quality in sound reproduction. CML continues the mission and dedication of LuEsther T. Mertz by keeping our audio magazine anthology completely free of cost. The number-one criterion for CML remains, quite simply, to present choice writing to our special audience.\n\n\nFacebook Twitter\n\nLegalPrivacy\u00a0 |\u00a0 Site Map\u00a0\u00a0\n\nChoice Magazine Listening is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization\n\nThe website is \u00a9 2000-2019, Choice Magazine Listening",

        "text":"Welcome to the Zaidan Foundation\n\nZaidan Foundation Program\n\nAdvisory Council\n\nThe Zaidan Foundation Program\n\nJurji Zaidan (1861-1914) was a prolific and famous Christian Arab historian, linguist and journalist who wrote widely on social and cultural issues. He came to Egypt from Lebanon at the end of the nineteenth century and founded in Egypt what is still one of the largest publishing houses for periodicals in the Middle East, Dar-Al-Hilal. His objective and rational interpretations of Arab and Islamic history and the Arabic language allowed the propagation of progressive western ideas. As a prominent member of a progressive group of Arab thinkers, he shepherded a movement to modernize the Arab world.\n\nMaking his views and works available to non-Arabic speakers would promote intercultural understanding at a time when Arab and Islamic thought is not sufficiently known or understood in the west.\n\nThe aim of the Jurji Zaidan Program is to:\n\n\u2022 Revisit Jurji Zaidan\u2019s work and re-evaluate his role in the development of Arab thought and his contribution to the Arab renaissance (Nahda) of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries;\n\n\u2022 Make available some of his works to a wide audience with an interest in the Arab and Islamic cultural heritage but limited or no knowledge of the Arabic language.\n\n\nComponents of the Jurji Zaidan Program\n\nTowards this end the Zaidan Foundation is sponsoring a number of studies, conferences and translations into English of some of his works as follows.\n\nA. Jurji Zaidan and the Foundations of Arab Nationalism\n(New York: Syracuse University Press, 2014) by Thomas Philipp.\n\nThe central theme of this volume sponsored by the Zaidan Foundation and published by Syracuse University Press is to demonstrate how Jurji Zaidan\u2019s secular analysis of history and language influenced the evolution of his Pan-Arab nationalist thought. It traces the manifold relationships between Zaidan\u2019s thinking as a historian, linguist and his views on Arab nationalism. The seminal contribution of this work is that it is the first to anlayze Zaidan\u2019s thought on history, language and nationalism as an integrated whole. The volume consists of three parts. The first part is an essay that demonstrates Jurji Zaidan\u2019s secular approach to the analysis of Arab and Islamic history and the evolution of language, especially the Arabic language. It goes on to assess how this approach influenced the secular pan-Arab nationalism that he spearheaded and which was the defining characteristic of the Nahda. The essay draws on articles written by Zaidan and published in Al-Hilal between 1892 and 1914 as well as his scholarly works. Thirty articles and excerpts from his scholarly works were translated for this book. They were chosen for their relevance to the topics covered in the essay. These translations are reproduced in the second section of this volume. The third section constitutes the first comprehensive bibliography of Jurji Zaidan\u2019s works both in Arabic and all the languages into which his works have been translated over the past century as well as works about him. \u00a0Details on this work can be found here.\n\nB. Jurji Zaidan\u2019s Contributions to Modern Arab Thought and Literature\n\nContents and Preface\n\nThe Zaidan Foundation sponsored a Symposium on Jurji Zaidan held at the Library of Congress on June 5, 2012. A volume on that Symposium entitled Jurji Zaidan\u2019s Contributions to Modern Arab Thought and Literature edited by George C. Zaidan and Thomas Philipp was published by the Foundation in 2013. The volume includes twelve essays by noted scholars in leading western and Middle Eastern Universities assessing Zaidan\u2019s contributions as an Arab nationalist, historical novelist, journalist, historian, linguist, social and political reformer, and educator. This volume complements and supplements Jurji Zaidan and the Foundations of Arab Nationalism (described under A above); the latter volume focuses primarily on Zaidan\u2019s contributions as a historian and linguist. For more details click here.\n\nC. The Translation Into English of Historical Novels\n\nJurji Zaidan wrote twenty-two historical novels between 1892 and 1914 more than one hundred of which were translated into nine different languages but none into English. The Zaidan Foundation has so far commissioned the translation into English of five of Jurji Zaidan\u2019s historical novels and more are being planned. All have been translated by leading literary and historical scholars in leading universities and include literary and historical commentaries by these scholars as well as Study Guides.\n\nTwo of these novels are set at the time and following the Arab conquest of Spain in 710-711 AD; two at the apogee of Arab and Islamic civilization during the \u2018Abbasid period; and the last at the time of the Crusaders, as follows:\n\n\u2022 The first novel is The Conquest of Andalusia (Fath al-Andalus) first published in 1903. It is set in Spain immediately prior to and during the Arab conquest which resulted in an Arab presence that was to last almost eight centuries. It was translated by Professor Roger Allen of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u2022 It is followed by The Battle of Poitiers \u2013 Charles Martel and Abd al-Rahman (Sharl wa \u2018Abd al-Rahman) first published in Cairo in 1904 and translated by Professor William Granara of Harvard University. It is set in France at the beginning of the eighth century and describes the Arab invasion of France and how the Franks, under the leadership of Charles Martel, united to stop their advance in Europe\n\n\u2022 Two other novels are set in the \u2018Abbasid period, during and after the reign of Harun Al-Rashid, best known to the Western world as the caliph whose court is described in the Arabian Nights during the zenith of Arab and Islamic power and civilization \u2014 The Caliph\u2019s Sister \u2013 Harun al-Rashid and the Fall of the Persians(al-Abbasa Ukht al-Rashid; 1906) translated by Professor Issa Boullata of Mc Gill University and The Caliph\u2019s Heirs \u2013 Brothers at War: the Fall of Baghdad (al-Amin wa\u2019l-Ma\u2019mun; 1907) translated by Professor Michael Cooperson of UCLA.\n\n\u2022 The fifth novel, Saladin and the Assassins (Salah al-din al-Ayyubi; 1913) was translated by Profesor Paul Starkey of Durham University in the UK and takes place at the time of the Crusades. Saladin is an important historical figure known in the west for having fought Richard the Lionheart, defeated the crusaders and recaptured Jerusalem. He established his rule over Egypt and Syria and founded the Ayyubid dynasty. In Egypt he overturned the Shi\u2018i Fatimid caliphate returning Egypt to Sunni Islam.\n\nDetails on all these novels can be found here.\n\n\nOpera on the Life of Jurji Zaidan\n(in Arabic) attended by the\nPresident of Egypt\n\nPrelude with Speeches of Literary Figures\n\n\nJurji Zaidan and his Family\n\nCentennial Celebrations\nof Dar-al-Hilal",
