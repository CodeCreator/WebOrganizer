        "text":"Leasing policy under review\n\nLEITH PHILLIPSAlbany Advertiser\n\nA tiny public notice in last Thursday\u2019s Albany Advertiser has sparked a groundswell of revolt against the City of Albany by community groups using local halls.\n\nPicture by Leith Phillips: Members of community groups using local halls met at an informal meeting this week at the King River Hall and voted for a public meeting to be held at 2pm on Saturday.\n\nAlarm bells rang for King River Recreation Club president Ron Bancroft when the club received a letter from the City saying it was revising its property management policy and intended to introduce a standardised rent for all properties under its control.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to commercialise it, but they\u2019ve forgotten that the halls are run by volunteers for the benefit of the community,\u201d Mr Bancroft said this week.\n\nHe said his club and other organisations paying a $10 annual \u201cpeppercorn\u201d rent under current leases were worried they would be hit by rises similar to the more than $1500 in lease costs and legal fees imposed on the Lower King Community Association\u2019s lease of Gomm Park hall earlier this month.\n\nAbout nine organisations have been rallied by the club\u2019s public notice asking concerned people to register support for a community forum to discuss the issue.\n\nRepresentatives who attended an informal meeting on Tuesday at the King River Hall voted to hold a public meeting at the hall at 2pm on Saturday.\n\nInvitations have been sent to City of Albany chief executive Faileen James, Albany Mayor Dennis Wellington, Albany MLA Peter Watson and O\u2019Connor MHR Tony Crook. Mr Bancroft said he and others were not reassured after being told by the City the conditions of current leases would be observed until the new policy was adopted.\n\nThe Albany City Council will consider the policy review at the end of May.\n\nMr Bancroft was concerned the wording of the City\u2019s letter to his club seemed vague and open to interpretation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll spend up to $7000 on our heritage-listed hall over a five-year period,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that we can make that sort of commitment but they can change everything and put us out, saying something like \u2018you\u2019re not cutting the grass, your lease is broken\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhat would happen to our playgroup with about 60 mothers?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that they are going to pick us off one by one, but we don\u2019t want to appear like a rabble and be confrontational. We want to get everyone together to deal with this issue.\u201d\n\nCity of Albany chief executive Faileen James said the City was happy to discuss its lease policy.\n\nMs James said the City\u2019s goal was to standardise all community leases so community groups were charged a fair and consistent rent.\n\n\u201cThis recognises the important contribution that all community groups make to Albany\u2019s social well being,\u201d she said.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

        "text":"British embassy in Tehran reopens four years after closure\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionJeremy Bowen reports on the thawing of relations between the UK and Iran\n\nThe British embassy in Iran has reopened, nearly four years after it was closed.\n\nForeign Secretary Philip Hammond attended a ceremony in Tehran with Iranian diplomats to mark the reopening while Iran has also reopened its embassy in London.\n\nThe UK embassy was closed in 2011 after it was stormed by protesters during a demonstration against sanctions.\n\nMr Hammond is the first UK foreign secretary to visit Iran since 2003.\n\nThe reopening comes weeks after Iran reached a deal with six world powers aimed at curbing its nuclear programme.\n\n'Important milestones'\n\nAt the ceremony Mr Hammond said the attack in 2011 had been \"a low point\" but since the election of President Hassan Rouhani things had \"steadily improved, step by step\".\n\nImage caption Mr Hammond said it was a historic moment in UK-Iran relations\n\nHe said: \"Last month's historic nuclear agreement was another milestone, and showed the power of diplomacy, conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect, to solve shared challenges.\n\n\"Re-opening the embassy is the logical next step. To build confidence and trust between two great nations.\n\n\"Iran is, and will remain, an important country in a strategically important but volatile region. Maintaining dialogue around the world, even under difficult conditions, is critical.\"\n\nEarlier Mr Hammond told the BBC there was a \"big deficit of trust\" with Iran, and \"major issues on which we have fundamental differences of view\".\n\n\"But the symbolic importance of deciding to reopen embassies in each other's countries, is that we have chosen to talk to each other about those differences... to look for areas where our interests do align,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright AFP \/ Getty\nImage caption The British embassy in Tehran, seen here in 2003, has been closed since 2011\n\nInitially, the embassy will be headed by a charge d'affaires, Ajay Sharma, but Mr Hammond said an agreement on upgrading to full ambassador status is expected to be reached in the coming months.\n\nA trade delegation has also travelled to Tehran with Mr Hammond and the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Damian Hinds to discuss possible future trade opportunities.\n\nMr Hammond said there was \"huge appetite\" from UK businesses interested in investing in Iran and creating conditions for British banks to be able to finance trade deals with the country.\n\nIn London, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw attended the opening of the Iranian embassy in South Kensington.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\nImage caption Mr Straw spoke with Iran's deputy foreign minister Mehdi Danesh Yazdi at the event in London\n\nHe told the BBC News Channel: \"It's a very important day for relations between Iran and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Relations have always been quite difficult, and they reached a further nadir in 2011, but this is really good news.\"\n\nIn November 2011 Iran announced it was expelling the UK's ambassador in retaliation for British support for tougher sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme.\n\nHundreds of protesters stormed embassy compounds two days later, smashing windows, torching cars and burning union jacks.\n\nThe UK responded by closing the Iranian embassy in London later that month.\n\nImage copyright AFP\nImage caption The British embassy in Tehran was stormed by protestors in 2011\n\nBut following the election of Hassan Rouhani and an agreement on how to deal with Iran's nuclear programme, the then Foreign Secretary William Hague proposed the reopening of the embassy in June last year.\n\nSince then, the reopening of the embassy has been held up by technical problems over visa policy and communications equipment, Mr Hammond has said.\n\nInside the embassy\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nBy BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen in Tehran\n\nAs he declared the embassy open, Britain's foreign secretary Philip Hammond said there were no limits to what Britain and Iran might achieve together over time, though they wouldn't always agree.\n\nA small group of Iranians who work at the embassy watched as the Union flag was hoisted in the 14 and a half acre embassy compound for the first time since 2011.\n\nBehind the high walls there are gracious lawns and dappled pools of shade from mature trees. It's all a remarkable contrast with the traffic and noise outside, in a scruffy part of inner city Tehran.\n\nBut for many Iranians, the compound with the lion and unicorn on the pillars of the gate is also a symbol of Britain's past meddling in their country. As a precaution, riot police were lined up outside the gate.\n\nInside the embassy, graffiti left by radicals who invaded it in 2011 is still on doors and panelling. Above a portrait of the Queen is the message 'Death to England'.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nMore on this story",

Bush\\\u2019s final months in office and now under Obama\\\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe spending bill upholds Obama\\\u2019s ban on torture of detainees in US custody, continues a general provision forbidding the establishment of permanent bases in Iraq or Afghanistan, and provides no funds to close the prison for suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday praised the bill\\\u2019s passage.\n\n\"In addition to giving our troops a pay raise and funding more than 100 million dollars for operation of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, this bill extends unemployment and makes health insurance more affordable for unemployed Americans,\" Reid said.\n\n\"We\\\u2019re keeping our country safe with critical investments in our defence and giving an important boost to our economy.\"\n\nReid took a swipe at rival Republicans, accusing them of \"political manoeuvring\" to slow down passage of the bill in order to delay debating health care reform, the next measure the Senate will be handling.\n\n\nLatest Articles\n\nMost Viewed",

        "text":"Fri Jul 28 08:37:33 SAST 2017\n\n'Intelligentsia needed to help Africa'\n\nBy Sapa | 2014-08-01 09:33:13.0\n\nFormer president Thabo Mbeki has suggested that African intelligentsia be brought back into crucial processes, as was the case in the 1960s and 70s, to help with the continent's \"pressing strategic\" problems.\n\n\"I would like to suggest that the African intelligentsia has a critically important role to play. I am suggesting that one of the matters we should discuss... is what should all of us do to help reinsert today's African intelligentsia... into the important processes we have convened to discuss,\" Mbeki said at a meeting of African leaders in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, on Thursday.\n\n\"The older among us will remember the period... when the African intelligentsia in our universities throughout Africa made critical and cogent interventions to help define Africa's response to her... issues.\"\n\nIntelligentsia is a group of intellectuals or highly educated people who guide the political, artistic, or social development of their society.\n\nMbeki said continental policies were not being implemented by some governments, and part of the problem was a failure to manage diverse societies.\n\nSome governments were not even aware of the existence of these policies, which were binding on all member states of the African Union.\n\nAfrica had an extensive set of policy positions which covered issues from politics to economy, war and peace, gender equality, justice, children's rights, education, culture, and international relations.\n\n\"I believe that this is very important for us here today because it provides at least a point of entry or even leverage to try to persuade our various countries and regions to implement these continentally-approved policies.\"\n\nMbeki said Africa's failure to manage its diverse societies had resulted in persistent social instability, civil war and violent conflicts, exclusion and inequality, a lack of cohesion, and an increased \"brain drain\".\n\nAfrica had various diverse cultures and languages, and success on the continent depended on a common national identity, a shared objective, and proper management of diversity.\n\n\"The real challenge we face is seriously and successfully to answer the strategic question -- what interventions should be made, and by whom, to ensure that 'sectional' identities, while they exist as legitimate identities informing the richness of the nation, do not threaten national cohesion and the development of a shared sense of common nationhood?\" he asked.\n\nProcesses needed to be put in place to make unity attractive.\n\n\"All citizens of the nation state, regardless of their 'sectional' identities, should have, and feel that they have, the political possibility to help determine theirs and the destiny of their nation as a whole through inclusive and legitimate processes,\" said Mbeki.\n\n\"All socio-economic development initiatives affecting all elements of human development, especially those initiated, permitted or facilitated by the State, should be organised in such a manner that the resultant material benefits are shared by all citizens across their sectional identities.\"\n\nHe said all government activities should be organised and executed in a manner that confirmed the shared common political citizenship.\n\nAfrica continued to rise, its problems persisted, and intelligentsia was needed.\n\n\"I say this because I know from my own practical experience that in reality we have a significantly large pool of this intelligentsia, a vital repository of the 'brain power\/intellectual resource' we need, which is deeply concerned exactly to help address Africa's pressing strategic challenges,\" Mbeki said.",

        "text":"Dinesh D'Souza\n\nThe producer of Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s hit, anti-Obama film, who believes D\u2019Souza\u2019s prosecution on federal campaign-finance charges is political payback, is urging President Obama to affirm his support for the First Amendment\u2019s right of free speech in his State of the Union address tonight.\n\n\u201cI understand that the president will be speaking in the state of the union speech about income inequality,\u201d Gerald R. Molen, the producer of \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America\u201d and the Academy Award-winning film \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d told WND.\n\nWatch Bill Ayers and Dinesh D\u2019Souza face off over \u201cWhat\u2019s So Great About America?\u201d This extraordinary Left versus Right debate will take place Thursday, Jan. 30, at 7:30 pm EST.\n\n\u201cI am also hoping that he will make a statement that all citizens are equal under the law and that his most vocal critics in popular culture will not be singled out for special scrutiny and selective prosecution,\u201d Molen said.\n\nD\u2019Souza\u2019s 2008 film \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America,\u201d which envisioned dire consequences for the nation if Obama were elected to a second term, became the second-highest grossing political documentary of all time.\n\nWatch the movie that explains it all. The movie that everyone is talking about. The movie the White House doesn\u2019t want you to see!\n\nFederal authorities have accused D\u2019Souza of donating more than the legal requirement to the 2006 campaign of Republican Wendy Long, who lost the race for the Senate seat in New York that had been vacated by Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe indictment charges D\u2019Souza donated $20,000 to Long\u2019s campaign by aggregating the money from various people and falsely reporting the source of the funds.\n\nAs WND reported, many of D\u2019Souza\u2019s defenders see the indictment as the administration exacting revenge over D\u2019Souza\u2019s film.\n\nMolen, in a previous WND interview, called the charges against D\u2019Souza \u201cthe equivalent of prosecuting a political dissident in the Soviet Union for jay-walking.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, jaywalking in the Soviet Union is a crime, but it\u2019s a minor crime. The real point is that you are a political dissenter and the government wants to put you away,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen Dinesh D\u2019Souza can be prosecuted for making a movie,\u201d he continued, \u201cevery American should ask themselves one question: \u2018What will I do to preserve the First Amendment?'\u201d\n\nFilmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch\n\nDennis Michael Lynch, well-known for his films on immigration, \u201cThey Come to America\u201d and \u201cThey Come to America II: The Cost of Amnesty,\u201d also sees a political motive behind the charges.\n\n\u201cIs he guilty of what it is they claim he did? I have no idea,\u201d Lynch told WND.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cGuilty or not, they\u2019re going to throw him into the mud to discredit his name.\u201d\n\nAnd why would \u201cthey\u201d do that? Because, Lynch pointed out, D\u2019Souza has another film coming out, right before the 2014 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cWhat Dinesh D\u2019Souza proved is there is a huge appetite, a huge audience, for the kinds of films that he and I make. That\u2019s why it won\u2019t happen again. Because, the other side knows that. And they want to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d observed Lynch.\n\nHe said what D\u2019Souza accomplished is extremely rare, because it is almost impossible for conservatives to get distributors to show their films in theaters. Almost all conservative filmmakers have to sell their movies as DVDs.\n\nDinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s books are available at the WND Superstore\n\n\u201cDinesh was the exception. He had the perfect storm. Everything lined up. He went about it the right way,\u201d he said.\n\nD\u2019Souza\u2019s new film, \u201cAmerica,\u201d is scheduled for release July 4, and Molen predicts it will become a thorn in Obama\u2019s side because of the prosecution against D\u2019Souza.\n\n\u201cThis action may have been designed to intimidate us, but it will have the opposite effect,\u201d Molen said.\n\nLynch also believes the prosecution of D\u2019Souza will boomerang because of the old adage, \u201cThere is no such thing as bad publicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, this is going to be a huge win for Dinesh. He couldn\u2019t get more lucky. He\u2019s going through the pain right now, but when that new film comes out, it\u2019s going to be the talk of the town,\u201d Lynch predicted.\n\nD\u2019Souza pleaded not guilty to the charges last week in federal court in Manhattan, where he was released on $500,000 bond and restricted to travel in the U.S.\n\nHe faces a maximum of two years in prison for the illegal contributions charge and a maximum of five years in prison for a false statements charge.\n\nD\u2019Souza\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, released a statement saying, \u201cMr. D\u2019Souza did not act with any corrupt or criminal intent whatsoever. He and the candidate have been friends since their college days, and at worst, this was an act of misguided friendship by D\u2019Souza.\u201d\n\nMolen insists the Obama administration \u201cis engaging in a practice of \u2018selective enforcement of the law,\u2019 where there is double standard such that if you oppose Obama politically, the IRS and the Department of Justice knock on your door, but if you\u2019re a liberal who supports Obama, you can say anything you want.\u201d\n\nIn the eyes of the Obama administration, Molen contends, D\u2019Souza\u2019s crime was to dare to produce a movie that could damage President Obama at the polls.\n\n\u201cThis is not the America we grew up in,\u201d Molen said. \u201cIn the America I treasured, a president would go out of his way to protect those who disagreed with the president\u2019s policy. That\u2019s what the First Amendment is all about.\u201d\n\nMolen said D\u2019Souza is encouraging Americans who still treasure the First Amendment and want to preserve the right to express political dissent without being prosecuted to \u201cvote with your feet\u201d by making the debut of D\u2019Sousa\u2019s next film, \u201cAmerica,\u201d a success at the box office.\n\nSee a trailer for the upcoming film:\n\nNote: Read our discussion guidelines before commenting.",

A VVPAT is an independent verification system for voting machines designed to allow voters to verify if their vote was cast correctly. Along with voters this will help election commission to detect the irregularities. Additional Chief Electoral Officer Dibyendu Sarkar on Saturday said that in 22 Assembly constituencies the facility will be available where the voters will be able to see the candidate for whom they had casted their vote.\n\nMeanwhile, the Deputy Election Commissioner Sandeep Saxena will convene a meeting, through video conferencing, with the District Magistrates who are also the District Election Officer (DEO) and also the Superintendent of police in the districts. \u00a0He will hold a meeting with senior election officials in the state to take a stock on the poll preparation in the state. It was learnt that ahead of the visit of the full bench of the election commission, Saxena will review the poll preparedness and how the central forces have been used especially in the sensitive pockets. He may hold a meeting with the District Magistrates of the adjoining districts in the commission\u2019s office in the city. Sarkar said that from December 1, 2015 around, 1,40,902 non-bailable warrant have been executed, whereas executions have been pending for 46,000 cases. \u00a0Execution rate has been improved. Around 3,84,218 liter of illicit liquor has been seized from various places, Sarkar maintained.\n\nShare it",

President Barack Obama appointed Cordray to the CFPB director position during a brief congressional recess in 2012, and Cordray's term as director would end this year if he is not confirmed.\n\nMany Senate Republicans have consistently said they would block any CFPB nominee if certain structural changes were not made to the agency makeup.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans have supported replacing the CFPB director's position with a five-member panel of leadership. Legislation that would create such a panel (S. 205) has been introduced in the Senate.

The bone of contention is the bill that seeks to regulate the entry of outsiders in the state through a permit.\n\nThe police say that the bill were passed in the assembly and the protestors were upset that none of the legislators opposed the same in the assembly yesterday.\n\nWhy is Manipur burning?\n\nObjection to Manipur Land Revenue & Land Reform Act\n\nThe bone of contention was the Manipur Land Revenue & Land Reform Act (7th amendment bill of 2015). The contention is that the bill will only ensure that the tribals will lose their lands. The protestors say that the tribal areas are now off limits for the non-tribals.\n\nThe bill will now make the tribal areas accessible to all. The ones to suffer would be the tribals, Kukis and Nagas as they would end up losing land. The bill aims at setting 1951 as a base year to identify non-indegenous people.\n\nThese people are considered to be outsiders by the protestors. As per the amendment passed in the Manipur assembly yesterday, those who have settled in Manipur prior to 1951 can have property rights.\n\nThe protestors say that many do not have exact records of when they settled in these areas. This would ideally mean that they will have to give up their land and leave.\n\nRestrict entry of outsiders\n\nThe protestors were also questioning the bill which allows entry of non-tribals or outsiders. The protestors say that this will only lead to snatching away of land. The protestors say that the Nagaland model should be in force where the entry of outsiders is restricted or regulated.\n\nManipur has been witnessing protests on the issue of Inner Line Permit System. They have been seeking regulating the entry of outsiders while adding that if no action is taken then it could lead to the loss of jobs and opportunity in Manipur.\n\nOneIndia News\n\nPlease Wait while comments are loading...",

American and Moroccan officials had agreed to security arrangements for his return in the last days of the Obama administration, but the deal was put on hold when President Donald J. Trump halted all transfers upon taking office.\n\n\u201cHe is ecstatic,\u201d said Bernard E. Harcourt, a New York-based lawyer and law professor, who represented Mr. Nasser in federal court. He and his co-counsel, Thomas Anthony Durkin, spoke to Mr. Nasser by phone at his family home in Casablanca, and declared the former prisoner of more than 19 years in good spirits. He was particularly buoyed by being reunited with extended family members who had gathered for Eid al-Adha, the Muslim holy day known as the Feast of Sacrifice, Mr. Harcourt added.\n\n\u201cHe did say it was amazing for him to go home when all his family was there,\u201d Mr. Harcourt said.\n\nMr. Nasser\u2019s legal status in his home country was unclear. He was held for a time Monday in a jail near Casablanca, and Moroccan justice officials said in a statement that the police were investigating him for alleged involvement in terrorism.\n\nThe investigation was not unusual. Previous Moroccan citizens who were repatriated from Guant\u00e1namo were held for days, if not months, and some were charged with terror-related offenses.\n\nThe London-based legal and human rights advocacy firm Reprieve said in a statement that Mr. Nasser would not be doing interviews with news organizations \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d It quoted him in the statement as declaring that, although he was born on March 4, he considered himself \u201cborn again on July 19,\u201d the day of his release from U.S. military detention.\n\nBe the first to comment\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.",

One location on their list: Covina in the San Gabriel Valley.\n\nCities that have at least a 10 percent population of both white and non-white people are considered integrated but the researchers say that is gradually disintegrating in many locations.\n\nCovina has a population that is currently around 57 percent Latino, 25 percent white and 12 percent Asian with the rest of population either African American or Native American.\u00a0\n\nResidents Gus and Shannon Medrano moved from La Puente to Covina with their two children a year ago. Gus Medrano is Hispanic and his wife is white. They say they are glad to live in such a diverse area.\u00a0\n\n\"It\u2019s nice to see a mixture of everything and not have\u00a0just\u00a0little sections that\u00a0are\u00a0just one nationality \u2026 there's a little bit of everything here in Covina,\" Gus Medrano said.\n\nBut if trends hold, Covina by 2025\u00a0will eventually be overwhelmingly Latino with comparatively few white residents.\u00a0\n\nBader, a sociologist at American University, said in the late 20th century, \"there was a large wave of immigration in particular from Mexico and Central America and a lot of immigrants moved to Covina.\" As these families grew, so did the Latino population.\n\nMinorities are now moving to Covina for its affordable housing and connections to ethnic communities. But Bader said white people aren't moving to Covina or other similarly diverse areas.\u00a0\n\nFor whites, he said, there\u2019s \u201ca combination of aversions to moving to neighborhoods and a lack of knowledge of neighborhoods that aren\u2019t predominately white.\"\u00a0\n\nWhile white people may not seek out integrated cities, they will stay in a location that\u2019s already diverse, Bader said.\u00a0Covina may prove to be one such place.\n\nGeorge Fuller, who lives next door to the Medrano family and has been a Covina resident since the 1960s, is white and doesn't plan to move.\n\n\"If I had to make the decision to move in tomorrow, I would say, 'Yes, I would.' It\u2019s an attractive set of circumstances,\" he said of Covina.\n\nStill, white people are leaving the city. They may give different reasons for packing up, but Albert Flores, who is Hispanic, doesn\u2019t always buy their explanations.\n\nHe said he's heard reasons such as Covina's changed or \"gone downhill.\"\n\n\"I don't see that,\" Flores said. \"I gather because \u2014 maybe \u2014 when they were there, it was more predominantly white.\"\u00a0\n\nTerry Wysocki, another white resident who has lived in Covina for decades, said he knows people who have moved away partly because of the changes in its demographic makeup.\u00a0\n\n\"You know, nobody likes demographic changes,\" he said. \"I mean, you know no matter which way it goes from brown to\u00a0white to brown, black to brown, whatever it might be. People don't like cultural changes happening in your town and that's what causes it [the moving] to some degree.\" \u00a0\n\nBut Bader said there are negative consequences\u00a0if cities re-segregate.\n\n\"Segregation decreases the opportunities for blacks and Latinos and increases for whites and that leads to inequality,\" he said. \"The best schools and the best-resourced neighborhoods in this country are still predominately white.\"\u00a0\n\nWhen white people are unwilling to move into integrated areas, property values tend to drop, Bader said. And it\u2019s typically the taxes based on property values that help pay for schools.\n\nBader said real estate agents can play a part in preventing segregation when they advise clients on where to buy a home.\n\n\"They can inform themselves of neighborhoods, which they might not know about themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd show white residents those neighborhoods where they're still integrated and show the advantages of those neighborhoods.\" \u00a0\n\nIf segregation does occur, cities need to make sure that resources remain and don't follow white people out of town.\n\n\"Cities have a large role in redistributing resources to neighborhoods where property taxes might be declining and making sure that those schools are well-funded so that black and Latino and Asian children have the opportunities growing up that I think many white families have come to expect,\" Bader said.\u00a0\n\nThere are cities in Los Angeles that have managed to remain integrated\u00a0over a long period of time. While Bader is still looking at the reasons why they have, he believes it may be in part that they are near major lines of transportation and highways. He said being near places that get to central city locations are important and may inspire a diverse group of people to continue living where transportation is convenient.\n\nGus and Shannon Medrano said the idea that white people may be leaving or avoiding Covina because of the growing minority population surprises them.\n\n\"It\u2019s hard to wrap your head around that, that people could even think that. That\u2019s sad, it\u2019s sad,\" said Shannon Medrano.\u00a0\n\nShe said she\u2019s grateful that she can raise her children in a place that is welcoming to their mixed identities.\u00a0\n\n\"It\u2019s that culture \u2014 that it doesn't matter where you come from, you know they're going to take you in, they're going to embellish that and they're going to accept that and they're going to grow with it,\" she said.\u00a0\n\nRather than feeling afraid of what may come, she and her husband said they embrace the diversity they see now, both in their neighborhood and in their home.",

There is colonialism. Chinese rule in Tibet is clearly unjust and untenable,\u201d he said.\n\nSangay\u2019s age and former membership of the pro-independence Tibetan Youth Congress have fueled speculation that he may harbor a radical agenda of seeking full independence for Tibet.\n\nIn his speech, however, he stressed his commitment to the principle of non-violence and support for the Dalai Lama\u2019s \u201cmiddle-way\u201d policy which seeks \u201cmeaningful autonomy\u201d for Tibet under Chinese rule.\n\nDespite devolving some powers to a democratically elected prime minister, the Dalai Lama will remain Tibet\u2019s spiritual leader and a major influence on major policy-making.\n\nThe political transition makes Sangay a far more prominent figure than his predecessor as prime minister, but the challenges he faces are daunting.\n\nThe government-in-exile is not recognized by any foreign states, and its legitimacy in the eyes of Tibetans in Tibet might be questioned without the Dalai Lama\u2019s patronage.\n\nBorn and raised in the northeast Indian tea-growing region around Darjeeling, Sangay went on to study at Delhi University before completing a master\u2019s degree at Harvard Law School.\n\nHe took up residency in the US and became a senior fellow at the school.\n\nHis profile is not unusual among the new generation of exiled Tibetan activists who, while observant Buddhists, see their professional qualifications as a crucial asset for leadership.\n\nYesterday\u2019s ceremony, presided over by the Dalai Lama, was held in the Tsuglagkhang Temple, the spiritual center of Dharamsala where the government-in-exile is based.\n\nAfter traditional offerings of tea and sweetened rice, Sangay took the oath of office at exactly nine seconds after 9:09am, the number nine being auspicious.\n\nThis story has been viewed 3004 times.\n\nComments will be moderated.

The Spanish Parliament wrapped up debate Thursday before holding a first confidence vote to allow conservative leader Mariano Rajoy to form a minority government and end a 10-month political impasse. (AP Photo\/Francisco Seco)\n\nSpain\u2019s Parliament voted Saturday to approve acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019s bid to form a new minority government, putting an end to the country\u2019s 10-month political deadlock.\n\nRajoy, leader of the conservative Popular Party, won a second term as prime minister with a 170-111 vote and 68 abstentions.\n\nDuring the vote, hundreds of anti -Popular Party protesters marched through Madrid\u2019s downtown streets carrying signs reading \u201cNo To The Mafia Coup.\u201d\n\nRajoy needed a majority in the 350-seat Parliament during a first confidence vote Thursday, but was rejected. He only needed more votes in favor than against during the second vote.\n\nGoing into the balloting, Rajoy had the support of 170 lawmakers, 137 of them from his own party. The rival Socialist party broke the deadlock by agreeing last week to abstain from the second vote. Fifteen of its members nonetheless voted against Rajoy on Saturday.\n\nFormer Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez resigned his Parliamentary seat early Saturday, leaving only 349 members taking part in the confidence vote. Sanchez said amid tears that he would not defy his party\u2019s decision to pave the way for a Rajoy government by abstaining, but could not vote for Rajoy either.\n\nRajoy\u2019s will likely be sworn in before King Felipe VI on Sunday or Monday. He has said he plans to announce the members of his cabinet on Thursday.\n\nStory by the Associated Press.",

It\u2019s not just possible to ask them for a refund. This has been done before the school calendar was disrupted.\u201d\n\nThe Minister further revealed that they opted for a\u00a0modified school programme because asking for a refund from vendors who have already bought food items in preparation for the project is impossible.\n\n\nSadiya added;\n\n\u201cThat is how we arrived at the modified school feeding programme of taking food rations into the households of this children. So how we got our data with children at home was another issue. When children are enrolled in schools, as part of the registration process has a detailed register which contains the address of parents and guardians of every people is kept with the school as well as the class teachers. We also obtained those from SUBEB and other sources.\n\n\u201cAlso, in the community where these are children live, every child\u2019s home can be easily identified by members of that community and management of these schools. So to ensure full transparency so that the programme is not compromised, we are submitting a full list of all the vendors to the EFFC and let me also state here that these vendors have been in the structure since 2016. So, we\u2019re using existing structure is not a whole new programme that were enrolling, no.\n\n\u201cThe vendors that have been in the programme that we are using because they used to provide these food and materials to the cooks to cook.\n\n\u201cWe have also invited other agencies of government including the DSS, EFFC, ICPC code of conduct and a host of NGOs and CSOs to help us monitor. I\u2019m sure you agree with me yesterday, you must have noticed a large number of people participating in the process or in the flag off because we engage as many stakeholders as possible to be part of that being very mindful of the social distance guideline.\n\n\u201cI am going into some [details] in order to disapprove some misinformation and misunderstanding around modified programme and to ask Nigerians to support this for active intervention designed to keep our children fed during this pandemic, So that objective of this National home work school feeding programme is not compromised.\u201d\n\nAbout CeleSylv Updates\n\n\n  1. Senseless talk, could you hear what u just said? pls how did u located those you feed?\n\n  2.

Obama said the administration will stop deporting undocumented immigrants who had come to the U.S. when they were at a young age.\n\n    Immigration experts encouraged undocumented San Francisco youth on Wednesday to prepare for next week when they will be able to apply for deferred deportation.\n\n    The policy change, announced by President Obama in June, provides a two-year deferral of deportation for people who came to the U.S. before the age of 16, are under 31 years old, and meet other requirements.\n\n    The first day to apply for the policy is Aug. 15, and members of the San Francisco Immigrant Legal and Education Network (SFILEN), the coalition that held Wednesday's news conference, encouraged people to prepare \u00a0ahead of time.\n\n    \"Start obtaining documentation, school records, medical records, anything with a name and dates,\" said Laura Sanchez, an immigration attorney with the Central American Resource Center (CARECEN), a group in the \u00a0coalition.\n\n    Other eligibility requirements include having resided continuously in the U.S. since June 15, 2007, currently being in school or having obtained a high school diploma, and having not been convicted of a felony offense or a \u00a0significant misdemeanor.\n\n    Sanchez said another critical thing to be aware of for immigrants seeking deferred deportation is the $465 application fee.\n\n    \"It's a significant amount of money,\" she said. \"Imagine having multiple family members who may qualify.\"\n\n    Anoop Prasad, an immigration attorney with the Asian Law Caucus, \u00a0said many people are wary of applying because they believe it could put their \u00a0undocumented family members who are not eligible for the program at risk. \u00a0Prasad said that is not the case.\n\n    \"Privacy act privileges are in place,\" Prasad said.\n\n    He said some are also waiting until after the November \u00a0presidential election to apply since a new president could alter or dismantle \u00a0the policy.\n\n    Sanchez said people interested in applying should consult with a \u00a0nonprofit agency that is part of SFILEN or an experienced immigration \u00a0attorney because \"it's somewhat of a complicated process,\" and said an \u00a0application form has still yet to be released by federal officials.\n\n    She also warned against \"notarios,\" people posing as immigration \u00a0attorneys or consultants.\n\n    Emmanuel Valenciano, a 24-year-old San Francisco State University \u00a0student, said he is an example of an undocumented immigrant who plans on \u00a0applying for the policy.\n\n    Valenciano said he was moved to the U.S. from the Philippines at \u00a0the age of 13.\"At that time, I did not know the consequences of staying here,\" \u00a0he said. \"I was afraid of the future, and didn't know if my status would be \u00a0fixed.\"\n\n    Valenciano said \"it was amazing\" when he heard of the new policy, \u00a0but said \"it's only a temporary\" fix for undocumented youth.\n\n    \"There are hard workers still living in the shadows,\" he said.\n\n    For more information on the deferred action process, visit the \u00a0U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website at",

        "text":"Staying true to net neutrality\n\nWill the FCC create a two-tiered Internet in which deep-pocketed companies get special treatment?\n\nChairman Tom Wheeler of the Federal Communications Commission said all the right things about net neutrality Thursday as the agency voted to release draft rules for preserving the open Internet. Nevertheless, real questions remain about whether the proposal he's championed is the right way to protect the Internet's reach, connectivity and innovative spirit. Perhaps that's why the commission provided an unusually long time for the public to comment on Wheeler's proposal and possible alternatives. It's a reminder that, despite the near-hysteria drummed up by some net neutrality advocates, we're still at the start of the rule-making process, not the end.\n\nAt issue is whether and how the government should try to stop certain Internet service providers \u2014 companies such as AT&T, Verizon and Time-Warner Cable that connect individual users to the Net \u2014 from favoring some sites and services over others. The fear is that ISPs would sell high-priority delivery to deep-pocketed companies, enabling their content to look and perform better at the expense of everyone else's. Although the FCC has been saying for a decade that broadband access service should be free from such interference, the courts have twice rejected its rules and enforcement efforts. There are no neutrality rules in force today, just antitrust and consumer protection laws to deter ISPs from tilting the online playing field.\n\nWheeler has proposed taking a case-by-case approach that would forbid ISPs from striking \"commercially unreasonable\" deals with sites and services that want to pay for premium access to Internet users. Critics on the left say his approach would lead to a \"two-tiered\" Internet with fast lanes for big companies and slow lanes for start-ups and innovators, while those on the right say it's a solution in search of a problem. The proposal is moving ahead in part because of language Wheeler added to clarify the sorts of deals ISPs would be barred from making, providing more assurance that consumers and content providers wouldn't face slowdowns, and giving more weight to a stringent regulatory alternative favored by many neutrality advocates.\n\nBefore Thursday's vote, Wheeler emphatically declared his opposition to a two-tiered Internet. \"There is one Internet. It must be fast, it must be robust, and it must be open,\" he said, adding, \"The prospect of a gatekeeper choosing winners and losers on the Internet is unacceptable.\" He's right about all that, yet good intentions don't count for much. The commission needs to show that whatever rules it adopts will actually promote innovation and investment, set clear guidelines for ISPs that won't shift with the political winds, and have a solid basis in law. Wheeler's statements raise the hope that the new rules will meet those tests. But the scrutiny is just starting.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018, Hartford Courant",

        "text":"Republicans losing blame game on fiscal cliff\n\nDecember 4, 2012\n\nA majority of Americans say that if the country goes over the fiscal cliff on Dec. 31, congressional Republicans should bear the brunt of the blame, according to a new Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll, the latest sign that the GOP faces a perilous path on the issue between now and the end of the year.\n\nWhile 53 percent of those surveyed say the GOP would (and should) lose the fiscal cliff blame game, just 27 percent say President Obama would be deserving of more of the blame. Roughly one in 10 (12 percent) volunteer that both sides would be equally to blame.\n\nThose numbers are largely unchanged from a Post-Pew survey conducted three weeks ago and suggest that for all of the back and forth in Washington on the fiscal cliff, there has been little movement in public perception. The numbers also explain why Republicans privately fret about the political dangers of going over the cliff, while Democrats are more sanguine about such a prospect\n\nThe blame question is all the more relevant because a near majority -- 49 percent -- of those polled expect the Dec. 31 deadline to pass without a deal, while 40 percent expect a deal to be cut. Perhaps indicative of which side believes it has the upper hand in the negotiations, 55 percent of self-identified Democrats believe there will be a deal, while just 22 percent of Republicans feel the same. Thirty-seven percent of independents expect a deal; 52 percent do not.\n\nThere also appears to be a disconnect between a general sense that going over the cliff would be bad for the country and an acknowledgement of what it would mean for peoples' lives.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of all Americans say that not meeting the Dec. 31 deadline would have \"major\" consequences for the U.S. economy, but just\u00a043 percent believe that it would have a \"major effect\" on their personal finances -- despite the fact that taxes would go up on the vast majority of the population on Jan. 1 if no deal can be reached.\n\nWashington Post-Pew Research Center poll\n\nRepublicans are well aware of where the public seems ready to put the blame if no deal on the cliff is reached. It's\u00a0why\u00a0House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) offered a counterproposal Monday to the one President Obama laid out last week. Simply letting stalemate stand for the next 10 to 14 days is unacceptable to Republicans who know they have to do everything they can to avoid the cliff -- and the blame for it that seems likely headed their way.\n\nAiles tried to enlist Petraeus for White House bid:\u00a0The Washington Post's Bob Woodward reports that in the spring of 2011, Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes relayed a message to Gen. David H. Petraeus, urging him to run for president if he wasn't offered the chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The messenger, Fox News national security analyst Kathleen T. McFarland, discussed with Petraeus the possibility of Ailes\u00a0resigning\u00a0to run his bid and News Corp. head Rupert Murdoch\u00a0bankrolling\u00a0it, but Petraeus wasn't interested in running.\u00a0Ailes said Monday the message he sent to Petraeus \"was more of a joke.\" Petraeus at the time was commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. He resigned last month as CIA director.\n\nBloomberg urged Clinton to consider\u00a0succeeding\u00a0him:\u00a0New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I)\u00a0reportedly called\u00a0Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton some months ago to encourage her to think about entering the 2013 race to\u00a0succeed\u00a0him as mayor of the nation's largest city.\u00a0\n\nClinton made clear she wasn't interested, but the outreach underscores her popularity and the extent to which she is in demand, politically. The call's revelation could also complicate relations between Bloomberg and presumptive candidate and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn (D), for whom the mayor has privately signaled support.\u00a0\n\nSmith, Wallingford considering bids to replace Emerson:\u00a0Missouri Republican Party Executive Director Lloyd Smith and state Sen.-elect Wayne Wallingford (R) each released statements Monday saying they would consider running to replace Rep.

        "text":"Lords reform: David Cameron defies threat of Tory revolt\n\nPrime minister backs Nick Clegg's House of Lords reform bill despite predictions of ministerial resignations\nHouse of Lords progress\nNick Clegg says the reform bill represents the best chance in a century to create a democratic second chamber. Photograph: Leon Neal\/PA\n\nDavid Cameron has given his strong backing to reform of the House of Lords despite Tory predictions of ministerial resignations and a large-scale rebellion over the plans.\n\nNick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, published the House of Lords Reform bill, which proposes to reduce the number of peers from 826 to 450, 80% (360) of whom will be elected. The remaining 20%, representing 90 members, would be appointed by a statutory appointments commission on a non-party basis.\n\nUnder the bill, members of the reformed house would only be allowed to serve for one 15-year term.\n\nClegg said the bill presented the best chance in 100 years to create a democratic second chamber, but he faces ambivalence from Conservative whips and demands from Labour for more time to debate the 60-clause bill.\n\nCameron earlier on Wednesday lent his weight to the reforms as he told MPs at prime minister's question time that \"it really is time to progress\". He said: \"We have been discussing this issue for 100 years and it really is time to make progress. The truth of the matter is\u00a0\u2026 there are opponents of Lords reform in every party.\n\n\"But there is a majority in this house for a mainly elected House of Lords and I believe there's a majority for that in the country. But if those who support Lords reform don't get out there and back it, it won't happen. That is the crucial point.\"\n\nThe prime minister made his comments as ministerial aide Conor Burns became the first government backbencher to indicate he intended to vote against the programme motion, which sets out the timetable for the Commons debate on the bill.\n\nThe shadow cabinet has said it would support the bill when it receives its two-day second reading in the Commons, which is likely to be at the beginning of July, but said it would not support the motion that would speed up the passage of the bill through the Commons.\n\nThe prime minister branded Labour's position as \"hopeless\", after being pressed by Conservative MP Helen Grant, on whether he agreed it was \"stupid\" to vote for Lords reform, but against the timetable motion.\n\nLabour has promised to support the bill itself but is threatening to derail the procedure motion, which sets out the time it gets to be debated in parliament.\n\nCameron referred to the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, saying: \"It's absolutely hopeless in life and in politics to do what the right honourable gentleman is doing, which is to say he's in favour of it, and he's also against it. It's hopeless.\"\n\nThe coalition government is braced for a widespread revolt over the proposals, with Cameron put on notice about the strength of feeling in his own party ranks after Burns became the first ministerial aide to signal he was prepared to resign over the reform.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the bill's publication, Burns challenged the amount of time for debate for a major constitutional reform, saying it should be \"at length and in full\".\n\n\"So on that basis, I would certainly be attracted to voting against any programme motion that would constrain the amount of time parliament can debate this for,\" he said.\n\nBurns suggested he would be prepared to resign over the matter. \"If I lose my job for something that was a mainstream view within the Conservative party within the last parliament, which serving cabinet ministers held as their view, so be it,\" he said.\n\nEleanor Laing, a Tory backbencher, warned that the majority of the Conservative party not bound by ministerial office to support the government opposed this type of reform of the second chamber.\n\nBut the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, said it would be a \"terrible mistake\" if Tory backbenchers decided to \"lark about and upset the Liberals\" by disrupting the government's programme.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: \"As a party member, to show your commitment by actually wrecking the government's legislative programme, which is actually what they would do \u2013 I think that is pretty bizarre.\"\n\n\"It's bound to be a compromise,\" he added. \"The problem is there isn't a solid majority on almost any detail \u2013 bishops, electoral system.\"\n\nConservative MP Jesse Norman, who is campaigning against the reforms, said the bill was a \"total nonsense\". He told the programme he would \"absolutely without any question\" vote against it and the government's timetable.\n\n\"It is a constitutional monstrosity of a bill,\" he added.\n\nUnder the terms of the bill, elections for the second chamber would be held alongside general elections, starting in 2015. A form of proportional representation known as a \"semi-open list system\" will be used, where voters can opt to vote either for a political party or an individual candidate in their region.\n\nIn a move that has angered many supporters of reform, they will be joined by 12 Church of England bishops \u2014 down from 26 church representatives.\n\nTo deal with opponents' claims that an elected second chamber would undermine democracy, the bill also includes a specific commitment to retain the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949.\n\nThey allow for the Commons to overrule the Lords in certain circumstances to force through measures. The government has threatened to invoke them to push through Lords reform.\n\nThe \u00a3300-a-day maximum pay limit desired by the government is not set down in the bill \u2013 which says only that elected Lords members must not earn more in a year than an MP.\n\nPublishing the proposals, Clegg said: The coalition stands on the brink of a historic achievement. After more than a hundred years of debates, cross-party talks, green papers, white papers, command papers and a royal commission, we are finally introducing a bill to create a democratic and legitimate House of Lords.\n\n\"It cannot be right that ordinary, hard-working people are expected to obey laws that are created by people appointed entirely by birth or patronage, who have a generous pay packet and a job for life. The time for idle talk is finished. Now is the time for action.\"",

        "text":"Israel mobilizes ground forces for an incursion into Gaza, after rockets fired at Jerusalem\n\nSaturday, November 17, 2012\nBy Paul Martin\n\nNovember 17, 2012\n\nTEL AVIV\u2014Israel\u2019s military stepped up its mobilizations for a possible ground invasion of the Gaza Strip on Friday after Palestinian rockets struck near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as neighboring Egypt escalated its own war of words against Israel. Late Friday, Israel\u2019s cabinet approved the call-up of 75,000 Israeli reservists, more than doubling the number authorized the previous day. Heavy armor and soldiers from two elite brigades continued to mass at staging grounds on the Gaza border. A decision to launch a ground invasion could come within 24 to 36 hours if rocket fire continues, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon told CNN on Friday \u201cThey don\u2019t call up all these reserves to keep people standing in the stands watching,\u201d said a senior Israeli military official. \u201cAfter rockets on Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, it\u2019s pretty hard not to\u201d order a ground invasion. For three hours on Friday, Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil visited the Gaza Strip and stood hand-in-hand with leaders of Hamas, the militant and political group that rules Gaza. Coming after two days of Israeli strikes there, it was a bold show of support for Hamas from Cairo as well as a diplomatic gambit to gain a break in the fighting. Israel had pledged to hold its fire during Mr. Qandil\u2019s visit. But rockets from the Palestinian territory could be heard taking off toward Israel, even as the Egyptian premier spoke to reporters. The emerging question in the latest conflict\u2014which was sparked by a rise in Gazan rocket attacks on Israel earlier this month, and broke into the open when Israel assassinated Hamas\u2019s top military commander on Wednesday\u2014is how far Egypt\u2019s new Islamist government can extend itself on the behalf of its ideological allies in Hamas. Egypt is a peace partner of Israel. Its gasping economy depends on Western largess and its military largely is funded by the U.S. In recent days, U.S. President Barack Obama has had several calls with Egypt\u2019s recently elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, aimed at bringing Hamas in line. During Friday\u2019s call, the White House said, President Obama commended Egypt\u2019s efforts to de-escalate the situation. \u201cMorsi\u2019s room to maneuver is very limited,\u201d said Ofer Zalzberg, a Middle East analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cHe is dependent on the West. Everything he has done so far is pretty standard, not very different than what [former President Hosni] Mubarak would have done. Even sending the PM to Gaza, he declared that only after his conversation with Obama. So he\u2019s not out there acting unilaterally.\u201d If Israel\u2019s leaders give the order for a ground assault on Gaza, it would be the first such operations since 2009 and would plunge Israel\u2019s government into risky territory\u2014risking soldier casualties and steep political fallout should the operation go awry, and jeopardizing its international backing. Israel\u2019s three-week ground war against Hamas in 2009 left more than 1,000 Palestinians dead, and destroyed entire villages and much of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure. Israel\u2019s image tanked internationally as it fended off war-crimes accusations. Prime Minister Qandil arrived in Gaza on Friday morning to demonstrate his new government\u2019s clear policy break from Mr. Mubarak\u2019s more-pro-Israeli regime. In a visit unprecedented for such a senior Egyptian official, he met with Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh before visiting wounded civilians at a crowded Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. -WSJ\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nJoin the revolution in 2018.

        "text":"'Go To Work!' Minnesotans Vent As State Government Shutdown Continues\n\nJul 5, 2011\n\nIn Minnesota, where the state government has been shut down since Friday while the Democratic governor and Republican-controlled legislature remain at odds over how to fill a $5 billion budget gap, some lawmakers got an earful on Monday as they marched in July 4th parades.\n\nOur colleagues at Minnesota Public Radio report that in Stewartville, Laurie Heydt shouted \"go to work!\" as Republican state Sen. Dave Senjem passed by.\n\nAs MPR adds:\n\n\"Heydt was upset that Senjem was in the parade at all. She and others along the parade route thought the Legislature and the governor should have spent the holiday weekend at the State Capitol, hashing out a budget deal. ... As the hour-and-a-half long parade wound from the west side of Blooming Prairie toward downtown and then back to its starting point, there were at least a dozen outbursts from the crowd aimed at the state senator.\"\n\nNot everyone in the crowds was angry enough to shout, however. The Star Tribune writes that \"lawmakers from both parties who ventured to public events met with mostly polite receptions, with just a few sparks flying.\"\n\nIf you're trying to follow the news from Minnesota, there's a \"Shutdown 2011\" blog now at MPR's website. Among its latest updates:\n\n-- \"After being deemed 'non-critical,' the Minnesota Zoo has been given the green light to remain open during the shutdown.\"\n\n-- \"Programs and benefits funded by Medicaid will continue and that food shelves will be stocked during a shutdown.\"\n\n-- \"A fire inspector laid off as the result of a shutdown was brought back to work to help investigate a weekend fire in New Ulm that killed six people.\"\n\n-- \"The shutdown is having a trickle-down effect. Prisons will continue to operate, but visitors won't be allowed except for at two state facilities. Meanwhile, the state's historical sites and state parks are closed, but businesses near federal lands, such as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, are doing OK.\"\n\nThe impasse came, of course, right before a major holiday weekend when many Minnesotans wanted to enjoy the state's government-run parks. As for when the shutdown might end, the Star Tribune says that the holiday weekend break \"hasn't lessened the rigid divide\" between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nMatt Sepic of MPR tells our Newscast Desk that the critical issue is how to \"erase a $5 billion deficit\" in the state budget. Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton, Matt says, \"wants higher income taxes on top earners. The GOP says no.\"\n\nCopyright 2011 National Public Radio. To see more, visit http:\/\/www.npr.org\/.",
