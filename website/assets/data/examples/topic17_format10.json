Bush\\\u2019s final months in office and now under Obama\\\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe spending bill upholds Obama\\\u2019s ban on torture of detainees in US custody, continues a general provision forbidding the establishment of permanent bases in Iraq or Afghanistan, and provides no funds to close the prison for suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday praised the bill\\\u2019s passage.\n\n\"In addition to giving our troops a pay raise and funding more than 100 million dollars for operation of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, this bill extends unemployment and makes health insurance more affordable for unemployed Americans,\" Reid said.\n\n\"We\\\u2019re keeping our country safe with critical investments in our defence and giving an important boost to our economy.\"\n\nReid took a swipe at rival Republicans, accusing them of \"political manoeuvring\" to slow down passage of the bill in order to delay debating health care reform, the next measure the Senate will be handling.\n\n\nLatest Articles\n\nMost Viewed",

That means the government can't access records for someone who called someone who called someone who called the suspect.\n\n\nNo longer will national security letters be kept secret indefinitely.\n\n\nRevelations that the U.S. monitored the communications of friendly heads of state have sparked outrage overseas. Going forward, the U.S. won't monitor the communications of \"our close friends and allies overseas\" unless there's a compelling national security purpose.\n\n\nObama is issuing a presidential directive that outlines what the government uses intelligence for, and what purposes are prohibited.\n\n\nObama called for a panel of outside advocates that can represent privacy and civil liberty concerns before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Those advocates would be present in for cases where the court is considering issues that are novel or significant \u2014 for instance, cases that raise a new issue the court hasn't dealt with previously.\n\n\nObama is directing the State Department to appoint a senior officer to coordinate diplomatic issues regarding technology and data-collection.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama is ordering changes to the government's collection of phone records that he says will end the program \"as it currently exists.\"\n\nObama said in a speech at the Justice Department on Wednesday that intelligence officials have not intentionally abused the program to invade privacy.\n\nBut, he also said, he thinks critics of the program have been right to argue that without proper safeguards, the collection could be used to obtain more information about American's private lives and open the door to more intrusive programs.\n\nObama announced the changes after a months-long review spurred by former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden's leaks about secret surveillance programs.\n\nRead tomorrow's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.\n\n\nComments on: Obama backs limits on NSA phone collections\n\nTo report abuse or misuse of this area please hit the \"Suggest Removal\" link in the comment to alert our online managers.

January 17, 2014 at 2:53 p.m.\n\nMaybe as usual I\u2019ve overanalyzed the NSA, Edward Snowden issue. Then maybe I haven\u2019t. Seems simple enough to me. Snowden violated laws; he violated his oath of employment loyalty; he figuratively spit in the face of every sincere American and countless foreigners; he continues to insult the intelligence of everyone who bothers to think. Privacy\u2014of what? It\u2019s largely a modern myth. It\u2019s been going out for decades. Do we want technology, or don\u2019t we? Do we want to be blown up by serial killers, or don\u2019t we? Do we want to be better at intelligence gathering than our national competitors, or don\u2019t we? On-and-on it goes, ad infinitum. Sure, folks have a point about their erstwhile \u2018private\u2019 stuff. We\u2019d all like to think that our communications with Aunt Maggie aren\u2019t front-page. But for all the paranoids out there: Just wait till technology can virtually read your mind! You and I probably won\u2019t live to see it, but rest assured\u2014it is coming.

January 17, 2014 at 4:20 p.m.\n\nPresident Obama just finished a long, long disquisition on the NSA, which most critics viewed as an attempt to distract from this week's revelations about his Benghazi cover up, the continued economic crisis, and Obama's plummet in the polls.\n\nHere whistleblower James Bamford discusses how the NSA was created by President Truman without Congressional authorization, the only agency so created.\n\nJames Bamford, an earlier NSA whisteblower, gave a great talk about the NSA at the National Press Club last night. In questions afterwards he stated that Obama was worse than Bush on civil liberties, we now live in a turnkey totalitarian state where everything is set up to turn on totalitarian control at any time, and that the left is mainly silent because Democrats are elected.

        "text":"\n\nDemocrats, led by Feinstein, are engaged in a war of words with the CIA.\n\nDems have votes to open CIA report\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee is poised to send a long-awaited report on the CIA\u2019s interrogation practices to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk for his approval \u2014 or redaction.\n\nChairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) says she has the votes on the narrowly divided panel to publicly reveal the executive summary and key conclusions of a 6,300-page report on Bush-era interrogation tactics, a move sure to fuel the Senate\u2019s intense dispute with the CIA over how the panel pieced together the study. That vote is likely to happen sometime this week.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut rather than a strong bipartisan signal from Congress, a vote to unveil the study appears set to divide along party lines because of that dispute.\n\nAll of the committee\u2019s Democrats, except Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, said in interviews or through aides that they will bless the public release of the document. Warner has not publicly indicated how he will vote, but he supported approving the final classified report on the same subject in December 2012. The committee has been bickering with the CIA ever since over the report\u2019s accuracy, as well as Feinstein\u2019s insistence that the study\u2019s key findings be released publicly.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Another Obama reset: Europe)\n\nThe panel\u2019s swing vote could be freshman Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, who has taken a measured approach to revelations over NSA data-mining and the flare-up with the CIA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inclined to vote to support [release]. But I still want to think about it,\u201d said King, who caucuses with the Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m going to review the CIA\u2019s response once more. I want to be sure the report is accurate.\u201d\n\nA vote to release the report is not the end of the committee\u2019s work, according to sources familiar with the process and committee rules. The full Senate doesn\u2019t have to approve the report before it hits Obama\u2019s desk for him to review the conclusions. But it\u2019s Obama who will ultimately decide whether the document needs to be further redacted, as the CIA will likely recommend.\n\nObama says he is \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to releasing the Senate report and has urged the committee to proceed \u2014 and Senate Democrats aren\u2019t letting up until details of the CIA\u2019s use of secret prisons and interrogation techniques are in the hands of the public.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Feinstein-CIA feud in uncharted territory)\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve a proper and and accurate accounting of the history, management, operation, and effectiveness of this program,\u201d Intelligence Committee member Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) wrote in a letter to Obama on Thursday. \u201cWe can finally correct the record, move past this dark chapter in our history and become a stronger nation for confronting our mistakes.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, led by Feinstein, are engaged in a war of words with the CIA over their five-year effort to assemble a comprehensive look at the interrogation of terrorist suspects. Feinstein has leveled explosive charges that the CIA interfered in the panel\u2019s investigation by removing access to an internal review of CIA interrogation techniques, which is believed to contain myriad criticisms of CIA procedure.\n\nThe CIA asserts that committee staffers committed wrongdoing by removing that internal review from a CIA facility and storing it on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has instructed the Senate sergeant-at-arms to unilaterally investigate and strongly backed Feinstein last week, telling CIA Director John Brennan in a letter it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to conclude that Senate staffers could hack into a classified network to acquire the internal document.",

The policemen were killed during a pro-democracy protest attended by hundreds of thousands of Shiites. Three other protestors were given life sentences.\n\n\"Our government hopes that the death sentences will not be carried out and that the judgment will be revised,\" said German Foreign Ministry spokesman Andreas Peschke. \"This draconian punishment impedes the process of rapprochement und reconciliation in Bahrain.\u201d\n\nThis is only the third time in over 30 years that the death penalty has been imposed on Bahraini citizens. The authorities said the four can appeal their sentences.\n\nDoubts about fairness of trial\n\nAmnesty International has expressed concerns about the fairness of the trial. The human rights agency noted that the accused were tried by a military court behind closed doors and can only appeal to a military court.\n\nBahrain hosts the US Navy's Fifth Fleet. The US issued a rare rebuke to its ally following news of the death sentences.\n\nSmoke and fire in Pearl Square\n\nPearl Square has been a focal point of the protests\n\n\"Security measures will not resolve the challenges faced by Bahrain,\" said State Department spokeswoman Heide Bronke-Fulton in a statement. \"We are also extremely troubled by reports of ongoing human rights abuses and violations of medical neutrality in Bahrain. These actions only exacerbate frictions in Bahraini society.\u201d\n\nShiites began holding demonstrations in mid-February. Bahrain's military imposed emergency rule on March 15. One day later, security forces were ordered to crush the protests. Since then, 29 people have been killed. With the exception of the four policemen and two foreigners, all were Shiites.\n\nMany Shiites say they face systematic discrimination in the Muslim island kingdom. Some Shiite groups have called for the monarchy to be abolished. Bahrain's Sunni leaders in turn accuse Shiite Iran of trying to increase its influence.\n\nAuthor: Wilhelmina Lyffyt (AFP, Reuters)\n\nEditor: Susan Houlton\n\nDW recommends",
