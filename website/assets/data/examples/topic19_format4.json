Quite the opposite: While our awareness of remote events has increased, and our networks have grown exponentially, I believe that the diffuse topology of our networks actually dampens the impact of an extreme event. Consider the \u201cButterfly Effect\u201d. Do you really think a butterfly flapping its wings in Jakarta is going to eventually cause a hurricane in New York City? Or do you think the minor perturbation is absorbed locally without cascading into some kind of resonance? Yes, there are examples that illustrate the dire consequences of unplanned resonance. Taleb (who waffles at the end of his book as half hyperskeptic, half intransigently certain) abandons the Gaussian bell curve, yet \u2014 with only a single mention of Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si \u2014 firmly embraces Power Law scale invariance as normative.Despite Taleb\u2019s too-casual treatment of scale, I think he would agree with George E.P. Box\u2019s statement (c. 1987) that \u201c\u2026[A]ll models are wrong, but some are useful.\u201d Abandoning our dogmatic devotion to certainty is essential in any creative, innovative enterprise \u2014 and can reveal hidden opportunities, and hidden abilities.\n\nRead the whole thing here.\n\nUnlike most reviewers, Shane could go head-to-head with Taleb on things mathematical ( though you hardly need a math background to understand The Black Swan) and Shane is right that networks that are intrinsically and generally resilient are better suited to enduring unexpected, system perturbing, black swans.\n\nHope to have my review up Sunday evening.\n\n7 Responses to \u201cTaking Aim at the Black Swan\u201d\n\n  1. Fabius Maximus Says:\n\n    Nice to see someone with strong math expertise dispute the \"fragile networks\" meme that has become so widespread, with so little supporting analysis or data.\u00a0 I wonder if this pessimism about \"systems\" results from the combination of our dependence on them AND our lack of understanding how they work.\n\n    An engineer might understand our utility systems, an MBA the finanical systems, a geologist the extrative sytems \u2014 but to each of us\u00a0there are aspects that are unknown and disturbingly vulnerable.\n\n    I was at a community meeting in Fall 1999, organized to discuss Y2k.\u00a0 They were considering wind towers, water storage, etc.\u00a0 I asked each of them what preparations had been made at their place of work.\u00a0 Each said that their own piece of the system would run after Y2k \u2014 the traffic lights were fine, the hospital were fine, etc.\u00a0 Each person worried that the others were unprepared.\n\n  2. zen Says:\n\n    Hi FM\n    \"Fragility\" always depends on the direction the stress is coming from. A pillar is immensely resilient to vertical stress; horizontal stress\u2026.not so much.\n\n  3. deichmans Says:\n\n    Thx for the link, Zen!\u00a0 Looking forward to your review this weekend.\n\n    FM: We\u2019re a cynical bunch, aren\u2019t we? \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 Your story reminded me of the best Y2K practical joke I\u2019ve heard.\u00a0 A friend was at a 12\/31\/1999 NYEve party in a rural neighborhood.\u00a0 The host\u2019s son said (shortly after 11pm) that he wasn\u2019t feeling well and left the room; he later snuck into the basement and, at exactly Midnight, flipped the master circuit breaker for the home\u2019s electrical supply.\u00a0 What\u2019s funniest about the story is that nobody was surprised by the abrupt loss of electricity!\u00a0 So I guess we\u2019re gullible as well as cynical\u2026.\n\n  4. TDL Says:\n\n    \u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t take the MBA example of understanding, anything, too far!\n\n    MBA 2006\n\n  5. The Lounsbury Says:\n\n    I was not particularly moved by his criticisms as such.\n\n  6. Larry Says:\n\n    \"\"Fragility\" always depends on the direction the stress is coming from. A pillar is immensely resilient to vertical stress; horizontal stress\u2026.not so much\"\n    The force inside a pillar is the same in all directions. The difference is that the outside force is in shear vertically, and in is in a bending force horizontally, if applied to the center. Hard to shear a pillar vertically, but relatively easy to bend it horizontally. If the pillar is made out of something like stone it brakes when bent. The conservative\u00a0republican, now days,\u00a0hopes the pillar is made out of something resilient so the totalitarian force applied\u00a0horizontally will bend the pillar instead of\u00a0braking it.\u00a0Considering the totalitarian force has nukes and millions to lose, not a bad hope, I suppose.\n\n  7.

It would still be decidedly dry though.\n\nEach member is like the parent, Canadian model operational model.......with a slight tweek\/variation in parameters. Since we know the equations to represent the physics of the atmosphere in the models are not perfect, its useful to vary some of the equations that are uncertain(can make a difference) to see if it effects the outcome and how.\n\nThe average of all these variations(ensembles) often yields a better tool for forecasting. It's always more consistent. The individual operational model, like each individual ensemble member can vary greatly from run to run.........and represent an extreme end of the spectrum at times. The ensemble average of all the members, because it averages the extremes.............from opposite ends of the spectrum............changes much less from run to run.\n\n360h GZ 500 forecast valid on Oct 25, 2018 00 UTC\n\nGZ 500 forecastGZ 500 forecastGZ 500 forecastGZ 500 forecast\n\nBy metmike - Oct. 10, 2018, 10:30 a.m.\nLike Reply\n\nTemperature Anomalies from GFS ensembles(fairly reliable product) going out 2 weeks.

Then your \"reality\" would depend on how fast of a transmission you observed it with. Someone observing it with a string of thread would see it differently than someone with a camera, or even with someone with an entanglement experiment.\n\n& classical physics has left the building. (not that I think this is incompatible with classical physics)\n\nIIRC there is no information exchanged in that scenario, ie no \"break\" in causality \/ faster than c. Not sure I subscribe to the scenario you describe with changing spin. A NYSE trader would love that kinda communication speed advantage, let alone any wireless communications company. It is a \"state\" that the particle is in, I guess there can be a \"clone\" particle of sorts that share indefinite properties (specifically a state); as wiki says \"...which is indefinite in terms of important factors such as position,[5] momentum, spin, polarization, etc.\"\n\n\"Entanglement\" is misleading.\n\nReally this is not much different than \"distant star\" scenario we were discussing above. With theory, we can measure, calculate values & make predictions.\n\nI hope someone who knows more can correct me on this if wrong, but there is no change in state of either particle, merely the values become mostly definitive\/determined.",

        "text":"Monday, August 25, 2008\n\nWell, That Explains It\n\nThere's a post up at EUREKA unscripted that talks about where they get their nifty science ideas.\nWell, first of all, we have our science advisor Kevin Grazier to help us out. Whenever we come up with another \u201cout there\u201d idea, we\u2019ll ask Kevin to come up with actual science to help justify the concept. After a lot of hair pulling, the brilliant Kevin actually comes up with a way to make our silliness a practical, working sci-fi reality. Kevin also does a \u201cfact check\u201d of each script draft to make sure that we\u2019re not violating too many laws of physics each week\u2026\n\nBut Kevin\u2019s not always around\u2026 and yes, we\u2019re industrious little busy bodies. Which means, we do a lot of reading. And by \u201ca lot\u201d we mean\u2026 A LOT.\n\nYes, we\u2019ll read any science book, magazine, or periodical we can get our hands on. For example, Supervising Producer Curtis Kheel is currently reading \u201cPhysics of the Impossible\u201d by Michio Kaku as research for an upcoming episode. And Staff Writer Eric Wallace was recently seen digesting \u201cDeath by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries\u201d by Neil deGrasse Tyson.\nSo, they have NASA planetary physicist Kevin Grazier as an advisor, and read popular science books about astronomy and physics. That may just help explain why the biology on Eureka is so bad. Of course I'm biased, but I think that the life sciences can generate just as many entertaining plot lines as physics can, and those stories deserve the same kind of scientific input that's given to robots and time travel.\n\n(Yes, the post also says that they read Discover and other popular science magazines, but clearly their interest and focus is on physics.)\n\nTags:, ,\n\n\nSean Craven said...\n\n\nSean Craven said...\n\nSorry about the above... Sign-in is confusing me.\n\nI've got to say that I'm startled to find out that the folks writing Eureka do any research at all. While it's no doubt useful as a source of inspiration it just plain doesn't show up on the screen.\n\nI watch the show, I enjoy the show, I really bug my wife by writhing and making pained animal noises whenever the characters start using scientific jargon. I'm not a scientist, just an interested layman, but they just plain never get anything close to right. Not even a little bit.\n\nBut I can believe that behind the scenes there is some real speculative thought going on. I've done some scriptwriting myself and I can tell you that the limitations of the format are extremely hostile to any kind of abstract thought.\n\nThe use of jargon in SF is something I've been thinking about lately. I've written very little SF and I have to say that one of the reasons for this is that there's only one person in my writer's group that can cope with the science references.\n\nIt's an interesting thing. If you explain everything you wind up with an essay rather than a story. And if you don't, your audience is limited to those who either know enough to be able to interpret your cryptic references or who are able to enjoy the word jazz aspects of jargon.\n\nAnd this is something I find fascinating. One of the reasons why SF has become so much of a pop culture staple is that the language of SF has spread into the mainstream. Before Star Wars only geeks (and I'm self-identifying here) knew what words like blaster and hyperspace meant. Now if you say 'android' everyone has at least a loose idea of what your talking about.\n\nI find it extremely displeasing when scientific jargon is used purely for effect without any any signs that the words are understood by the writers, let alone the actors. I don't mind wrong; I hate note even wrong.\n\n(And to put my money where my mouth is, here's a biological\/zoological reference from a story in progress.\n\n\nThe Magpies were dinosaurs from a timeline where the asteroids that caused the Cretaceous extinction had been nuked until they missed the Earth. They were descended from arboreal Maniraptorans who had left the forests for the savannahs. They had black-and-white feathers and the faces of toothy owls, along with the typical Maniraptoran sickle-claw. They weighed about thirty pounds each and were still capable of limited flight. Despite these exotic details their evolutionary history had given them social and personal characteristics that were as close to human as it got. In other words you couldn\u2019t trust them for ****.\n\n\u201cDigital records for the purposes of lying, my friends. We use old analog tech of your noble people, photochemical emulsion on plastic film in sealed cannister. We develop ourselves and for sure you bring us the gizzard stones and not some river trash, you know? Any round rock it will not do.\u201d Mr. Big Johnson opened his snub beak to show sharp little teeth and bobbed his head up and down. \u201cHa-ha-ha!\u201d\n\nMr. Big Johnson\u2019s assistance animal picked up the camera and held it out to Duke. It was another feathered dinosaur with a silvery Magpie control blob on the side of its head, feathers patterned in green and tan with a cream-colored underbelly. This one was a local, an Ornitholestes, and despite their similar size and body shape it was as closely related to Mr. Big Johnson as rat-headed Purgatorius was to Skinner and had an IQ slightly inferior to that of a chicken. It opened its long, narrow jaws and echoed its boss in a parrot-squawk imitation of Duke.\n\n\nAt least I'm making an effort. Eureka! Try harder!\n\nPeggy K said...\n\nInteresting point about scientific jargon becoming part of the common language. Certainly \"cloning\" and \"genetic engineering\" are terms that even people who don't follow science at all are familiar with, even if they don't fully understand the concepts. I do think that SF can be enjoyable, even if you don't know the jargon. At least it was for me when I was a young teenager, long before I had much formal science education. Sure, there are some stories that require an infodump about black holes or whatnot, but there are plenty that don't.\n\nOne of the things that irritates me is that Eureka (and other SF shows) could say pretty much anything when they go into technobabble mode, so why not say something that makes some scientific sense. Sure most people won't know the difference, but some of us would and appreciate the effort.\n\nNote: Links to Amazon.com are affiliate links.

I brought an Arrow-II and an Icom \nW32A hoping to get a few AO-51 contacts.  The past two evening passes I \nhaven't heard anyone else using the satellite.  Is there anyone in \nHawaii using the satellite?\n\n\nMore information about the AMSAT-BB mailing list",
