Can these two terms be used interchangeably?\n\nAppendix 3 of the Code (ASME VIII-1) defines a \u201cclad vessel\u201d and a \u201clined vessel\u201d. To me, it appears that the differences between these two terms is based only on whether the corrosion resistant material is integral\/continuous (in case a clad vessel) or whether it is intermittent (in case a lined vessel). Is my interpretation correct?\n\nYour opinions on this subject will be highly appreciated.\n\n\n\nRE: Difference between cladding and lining\n\nThe wording and referenced standards of part UCL will clarify the meanings.\u00a0\u00a0In summary - clad is (100%) metallurgically bonded either during plate manufacture or by deposition of weld overlay; lined is simply 'stuck on' by attachment welds.\n\nSteve Jones\nMaterials & Corrosion Engineer\n\nRE: Difference between cladding and lining\n\n\nThanks for your reply. But now I have some other questions.\n\nBased on your below reply, would it be ok to interpret that a lining is in a way a \"mechanicaly inferior cladding\" since it is attached by plug welds?\n\nWhen is lining prefererred over cladding? What are the merits of lining over cladding?\n\nIs cladding applicable for metals only and does lining include both metallic and non-metallic (example- plastic lined, FRP lined, etc) lining?\n\n\nRE: Difference between cladding and lining\n\nIf you are intending to adopt UCL-23 (c), then yes, one would argue that lining is a mechanically inferior cladding.\n\nThe choice of whether to go for lining or cladding is a function of all the usual input parameters in materials selection: cost, availability, schedule, fitness for service etc etc.\n\nAs to the last question, you really should study the wording of UCL-1 and not get confused with painting and coating terminology that ASME VIII does not address.\n\nSteve Jones\nMaterials & Corrosion Engineer\n\nRE: Difference between cladding and lining\n\nI would not say that lining, ie stip lining or sleeve lining is inferior to clad in all applications.\u00a0\u00a0While clad is widely used in many applications, weld overlayed lining is preferred in reactors where higher temperatures and vacuumn may occur.\u00a0\u00a0Strip lining can be used where there are not wide deviations in temperatures and external pressure is not a concern and in alloys where clad is not readily available and time and monetary constraints are important.\u00a0\u00a0Recently the use of a solid alloy constuction for vessels that are relatively thin and austenetic stainless steel is much more economically feasible than a clad vessel of say 516-70 base with 304 or 316 ss cladding.\n\nRE: Difference between cladding and lining\n\nASME VIII Div 1, Appendix 3, para 3-2 defines exactly what clad and lined means\n\nHowever in my experience the two terms are sometimes interchanged and can cause some confusion as some people call clad, \u201clining\u201d \u2013 which I suppose is correct too.\n\nI define it as:\nClad steel is a base carbon steel material (which takes the pressure and loads) covered with a corrosion resistant alloy (CRA) material.\nThe CRA can be either integrally bonded (i.e. explosive or hot roll bonded to the base carbon steel material) or applied by weld overlay deposit.\nAlthough UCL-23c allows you take account of the claddings strength, I have never done this and most clients don\u2019t allow it either. The cladding is just assumed as a corrosion allowance and no credit is taken for its strength in the pressure calculations.\n\nThe CRA material can also be applied as strip lining or as loose sleeves in pipes. However there is still welding involved here back to the base CS material. Strip or sleeve lining is not used as stated above in high temperature services or where there is vacuum pressure. Additionally sleeve lining is used in situations where CRA material cannot be or is difficult to integrally bond to the base CS.\n\nLining are loose non metallic linings (e.g. rubber, PTFE) or painted \/ sprayed coatings or glass linings. The glass or painted \/ sprayed coatings may also need to be cured at temperature.\n\nThe loose non-metallic linings are bonded to the base CS\n\nLoose and coated \/ sprayed and glass linings will required attention to vessel internal surfaces,\u00a0\u00a0welds and nozzle corners which need to be of a smooth profile and radiused in accordance with the lining manufacturers or clients requirements,\n\nHope this helps\n\nRE: Difference between cladding and lining\n\n\na star for you for clearly out\"lining \" the differces (!?!) between the two.\n\n\nRE: Difference between cladding and lining\n\nThe difference has been rightly outlined by Roca.\n\nI wish to share my experience with a cladded & lined vessel. If any one wishes to measure the thickness of shell using Ultrasonic method, on a cladded vessel & a lined vessel, the results would be as under:-\n\nCladded Vessel : Will get thickness of Shell + Clad\nLined Vessel\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0: Will get Thickness of outer shell only.\n\nThis may sound simple but sometimes the info may be very useful.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRE: Difference between cladding and lining\n\nOne reason why lining might be preferable is that the lead times for bare carbon steel and bare alloy are usually significantly less than the lead time for clad material.\n\nAnother reason is that cladding usually has to be stipped back prior to welding the carbon steel portion to ensure good weld quality. Lining is added afterward so this is not an issue.\n\n\nRed Flag This Post\n\nPlease let us know here why this post is inappropriate.

        "text":"Developing Intelligence\n\nImagine you are invisible. Congratulations, you are now actually less likely to remember what you were doing a few minutes ago, and possibly a lot longer ago than that. At least, this is the basic finding from a 2002 article by Sahakyan & Kelley, who showed that when people are asked to forget something they\u2019d learned, they may actually do this by rapidly changing their internal context in a way that is similar to what happens if, say, you\u2019re asked to imagine that you\u2019re invisible.\n\nIn the laboratory, this is usually studied in the \u201cdirected forgetting paradigm,\u201d in which subjects learn a series of items (List 1) to a certain performance criterion, and then half of the subjects are told to forget those items. All the subjects then learn a second list of items (List 2), and are all subsequently tested on their recall of both List 2 and List 1 items. Typically, the results show that directed forgetting actually works \u2013 subjects who were told to forget List 1 actually are worse at recalling it later, even if offered money to do so. In addition, subjects who were told to forget List 1 are also better at recalling List 2, which may reflect \u201cescape from proactive interference\u201d (i.e., if you forget the first list, it\u2019s less likely to interfere with your memory for items in the second list.)\n\nSome theories suggest that people are actively inhibiting the List 1 items when told to forget them. In contrast, Sahakyan & Kelley hypothesized that people are not actively inhibiting them, but merely changing their \u201cinternal context\u201d, such that those items are now less likely to be retrieved. At first, this hypothesis may seem very abstract, but it actually rests on a well-accepted finding in the memory literature known as \u201cencoding specificity.\u201d Briefly, this principle states that you may be more likely to remember a childhood experience if you\u2019re walking around your childhood home; or you may be more likely to remember a studied fact during an exam if you\u2019re in a similar mood as when you studied it before. Encoding specificity has been shown in terms of mood, smells, and the physical environment.\n\nTo test this idea, the authors asked subjects to report their strategies during a directed forgetting experiment \u2013 sure enough, some reported \u201cthinking of something else, such as the upcoming wedding of a sister.\u201d In a subsequent experiment, they asked all subjects to imagine that they were invisible (and to state what they would do while invisible) after learning List 1 items. The results showed that all subjects showed that directed forgetting and \u201cimagining you\u2019re invisible\u201d have similar effects on recall, both decreasing List 1 recall and increase List 2 recall by similar amounts relative to a control group. A subsequent experiment showed this \u201cinternal contextual change\u201d manipulation in directed forgetting seems very similar to previous work involving a external (ie, environmental) context change between the lists.\n\nIt would be interesting to know how far into memory the effects of internal context change can actually extend. For example, are you less likely to remember everything after specifying a new context? Are you more likely to remember childhood experiences, perhaps a time when you also imagined you were invisible, or 10 feet tall? These are probably intractable but nonetheless very interesting questions for future research.\n\nA recently published article cites an in-press follow-up to this study, in which they showed the effects of internal context to be even stronger among those with higher working memory spans. Unsworth & Engle have interpreted this to reflect improved context maintenance skills in those with high working memory capacity. I\u2019m still waiting to get my hands on a copy of that paper, but will post an update when I do\u2026\n\nRelated Posts:\nReworking Working Memory\n\n\n  1. #1 Mitch Harden\n    March 27, 2007\n\n    Recently I read a paper by Fenske & Raymond (Affective influence of Selective Attention) in which they had participants actively inhibit certain images. Afterwards they rated the otherwise neutral images poorly (or at least less joyful than they would without active inhibition). I wonder if this \u201cinternal context\u201d change results in the same sort of depreciation of value that is found in active inhibition, or if this could be used to differentiate between the two phenomena.\n\n  2. #2 Peter Delaney\n    March 29, 2007\n\n    It was nice to see someone reads these papers besides directed forgetting researchers :)\n\n    Just for the record, we sent you the Delaney & Sahakyan \u201cin press\u201d paper a week or so ago, so hopefully you have it in your stack of to-be-read items. If not I can resend it.\n\n    Also, we\u2019re no longer thinking escape from proactive interference is the way to explain why people do better on List 2 after they change contexts (or try to forget List 1). Sahakyan has now proposed a two-factor account that attributes List 1 forgetting to context change (the Sahakyan & Kelley idea you outlined) but the better List 2 memory to changes in encoding strategy (Sahakyan & Delaney, 2003). For the past few years, she has been collecting evidence that the List 1 costs can be obtained without the List 2 benefits, and vice versa.\n\n  3. #3 charles joyce\n    March 30, 2007\n\n    I think you shall have to explain your concept in the much broader way.

        "text":"Tap Water Chronicles\n\nValencia's tea-colored tap water, now with more aluminum!\nValencia\u2019s tap water, now with more aluminum!\n\nThe people of Valencia have been drinking\u00a0water with elevated levels of aluminum for the last 29 months\u00a0now. Aluminum in drinking water has been linked with nerve damage, leading to Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s and Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only thing found in the water: in recent years, stuff like platinum, cobalt, iron, plankton and cyanobacterias has been found in local reservoirs, according to leaked data from the provider,\u00a0Hidrocentro.\n\nThis situation could be replicated in the capital, as the main source of water (La Mariposa reservoir) is facing illegal squatters and animal leftovers from witchcraft rituals. Still, this issue takes a backseat, as water itself has been scarce in some parts of Caracas for quite some time.\n\n\n  1. Gustavo, I think the serious problems with water pollution in Valencia and most of Carabobo started earlier. In 2006-2007, Chavistas diverted the water from the Valencia Lake towards the Pao reservoir. The Valencia Lake is highly polluted. They \u201ccompleted\u201d a water cleaning plant in Los Guayos, but this water plant is not working properly and it is already too small for the amount of liquid it needs to process.\n\n    They add huge amounts of chlorine to kill the bacteria \u2013 most of the time \u2013 but a lot of evil material gets in. Control of sewage has completely collapsed, this has been made worse with the proliferation of slums in such areas as Los Guayos, which is now a completely urban-marginal area, the densest municipality in Carabobo and one where the opposition hardly penetrates even if it is so close to the Panamericana.\n\n    There are new slums around the Pao-Cachinche reservoir as well and the waters get into there.\n    One of the largest landfills of Venezuela like close by and there all the worst rubbish of the State gets dumped using methods from the Middle Ages.\n\n    Everyone in Carabobo who can afford it now buys water from lorries or has special filters (hard to find). The poor try to boil the water but that does not take away the non organic poisons.\n\n    I wrote something about this three years ago:\n\n    \u2022 kepler, you are absolutely right, my father and I used to go fishing in the pao-cachinche reservoir, wich is about 45 minutes away from valencia, in the late 90s, around the early 2000s it became imposible to fish there, the boat got a thick mud-like (similar to sh*t) layer around it after you put it in the water, and you could not get any fish, and it is not only the valencia lake contaminated water that they pumped to cachinche, the pork farms that exists around the reservoir dump their waste in the reservoir as well, y de \u00f1apa, the water purifying facilities for the gran valencia area hasn\u2019t been upgraded in like 30 years, they simply can\u2019t handle the volume of water the city needs.

Around 2007, my brother was in journalism school and did a piece on this for a class, went to la Mariposa and came back traumatized after watching the animal sacrifices. Thus, this has been happening since at least 6 years ago.\n\n      \u2022 But could there possibly be THAT many animal sacrifices that they are affecting the water supply?\n\n        Amazing how some people are living in the 19th century.\n\n        \u2022 Somewhere in my 2010 Venezuela photos I have pictures of signs I saw at some of the off the beaten track spots near Valencia my cu\u00f1ado took us to that read: \u201cbrujer\u00eda prohibida\u201d.\n          I figure if someone had to go so far as post a sign\u2026\n\n  3. I live in Valencia and since last year I have been buying my water, I used to treat my drinking water with a pill to purify it but when all this discussion started, I began to buy it. But the point is that it has got worse. The color of water is like tea, most of the time it makes no sense to wash your white clothes because the end up looking in a brownish way. While we\u2019re still talking about this, there is no official recognizement of the problem, as if it does not exist. That\u2019s how everything goes around here.\n\n    \u2022 Do you know where the water you buy comes from? Have you had it tested to make sure it\u2019s not the same stuff, conventially filtered but mostly just cosmetically cleaned up?\n\n        \u2022 If you can afford it, your best bet is to purchase a ceramic filter and also an ozone \u201cfilter\u201d (which is not really a filter, but that\u2019s how they call them in Venezuela. The ceramic filter will remove solids and the ozone will oxidize (kill or get rid of) bacteria, virii (viruses), organic compounds which are harmful and cause foul taste, colors, and odors, and almost everything else. Ozone is very reactive, so in order to prevent re-contamination you may want to add a small dosage of chlorine to the water after its use.\n\n          Other popular solutions include the use of activated carbon (charcoal) to remove organics and UV-light \u201cfilters\u201d to eliminate bacteria or viruses. Finally, bleach is a low-cost solution which can also be used if you know how much to add to water. A simple pool chemistry kit is very useful in this case.\n\n    \u2022 Mar\u00eda Isabel, pero \u00a1qu\u00e9 muker tan fina eres t\u00fa!

Kudos to Gustavo, Kepler, Maripuerta, Moses etc. for local insights and links. Where are the PSF to comment on this? Arturo? Shame? GetaClue\/Chris Carlson? CortGreene?\n\n  5. And bear in mind: the problem is not just the Lake. Heavy pollution in the Lake started in the sixties of last century but people were not drinking water from there. Pollution there is now much worse with all kinds of pipelines going into the Lake without control. I know from first sources people in charge of giving permits for new construction around the area have been threatened unless they give the green light.\n\n    \u2013 Uncontrolled slum expansion has worsened both around the Lake and around the Pao-Cachinche (squatters, some of them on a very professional basis, not only do they occupy other people\u2019s land or state land and \u201cresell\u201d, but they lead thousands of others to do so)\n    \u2013 the government took the incredibly stupid decision to divert water from the Lake to Cachinche-Pao\n    \u2013 the water cleaning plants like the one in Los Guayos have collapsed and the rojo-rojito Hidrocentro managing them is completely incompetent\n    \u2013 the Gu\u00e1sima landfill, one of the largest in Venezuela, has become a major environmental disaster affecting not only the people living in the municipality but the quality of water departing from there to\u2026surprise, surprise: the lowest part of the basin, which goes to the Valencia Lake.\n\n    Carabobo\u2019s coast, which is cut off from the Valencia Lake basin by the mountains of the Litoral, has its own pollution issues\u2026caused by the refinery of El Palito and just uncontrolled sewage from all the new slums in those areas.\n\nLeave a Reply",

Not sure I subscribe to the scenario you describe with changing spin. A NYSE trader would love that kinda communication speed advantage, let alone any wireless communications company. It is a \"state\" that the particle is in, I guess there can be a \"clone\" particle of sorts that share indefinite properties (specifically a state); as wiki says \"...which is indefinite in terms of important factors such as position,[5] momentum, spin, polarization, etc.\"\n\n\"Entanglement\" is misleading.\n\nReally this is not much different than \"distant star\" scenario we were discussing above. With theory, we can measure, calculate values & make predictions.\n\nI hope someone who knows more can correct me on this if wrong, but there is no change in state of either particle, merely the values become mostly definitive\/determined.",

When this was happening, I\nmoved my beam left and right from the MIR position and the squelch closed\nagain.  It only opened when I was pointed at MIR and this \"open\" condition\nfollowed MIR across the sky.  This happening was also noticed by Junior De\nCastro in Brazil.  There was no communications heard, just a barely open\nsquelch with noise.  \n\nI believe this was caused by the squelch circuits in the FM receiver\ndetecting a threshold quietning of the receiver because of the hundreds of\nearth stations calling MIR for a QSO.  The external antenna on MIR may have\nbeen excited by all the rf from the ground and reradiating a small portion\nof it back again.  This same condition has been used by some to receive TV\nsignals behind a mountain range by putting back to back tv antennas on the\nmountain top and pointing the receiver antenna at them.  At any rate, what\never is causing it, I believe there is some reradiation of ground station\nRF.  I think it would take a pretty good TX\/RX setup to be able to\nestablish even one way communications.  Perhaps CW would be worth a try\nwith a moon bounce class station.\n\nJean-Louis.RAULT@tcc.thomson-csf.com wrote:\n> > > All of the Amateur Radio equipment on Mir is currently disconnected,\n> > > however, have you tried to bounce your signal off of Mir?\n> > > It called Earth-Mir-Earth?\n> Last summer, I organized a Mir bounce experiment.\n> The team was composed of about 10 skilled french hams and we performed many\n> skeds.\n> We were using AO-10 class equipment working on 145 MHz, that is 50 to 80 W\n> RF output to 10 or 12 el yagi beams.\n> Preliminary link budgets were showing that a little positive S\/N ratio could\n> be obtained (with narrow band CW) if the equivalent surface or MIR was 100\n> square meters or more on the 2 meters band.\n> My own reception chain was including a 11 el circularly polarized yagi beam,\n> followed by a SSB Electronic AsGa preamplifier and an ICOM IC-821H\n> transceiver.

More Information: Documentation, Community Support.\n\nWelcome to nForum\nIf you want to take part in these discussions either sign in now (if you have an account), apply for one now (if you don't).\n    \u2022 I\u2019ve just edited topological concrete category to correct the claim that topological functors create limits, which is not quite true: for instance, the forgetful U:TopSetU: \\mathrm{Top} \\to \\mathrm{Set} fails to reflect limits because choosing a finer topology on the limit vertex yields a non-limiting cone with the same image in Set\\mathrm{Set}. This is correctly reported on wikipedia and in Joy of Cats, p. 227.\n\n      It is true that topological functors allow you to calculate limits using the image of the diagram under the functor, which is quite powerful. In Joy of Cats, a topological functor is said to \u201cuniquely lift limits\u201d (definition p. 227, proven p. 363). There doesn\u2019t seem to be an nlab page for this property \u2013 I suppose it\u2019s not much used by most category theorists.\n\n    \u2022 at monoidal adjunction the second item says\n\n      while the left adjoint is necessarily strong\n\n      but should it not say\n\n      while the left adjoint is necessarily oplax\n\n\n    \u2022 I added the definition of uniform space in terms of covering families. But I don\u2019t know the covering version of the constructive \u201caxiom (0)\u201d.\n\n    \u2022 created arithmetic jet space, so far only highlighting the statement that at prime pp these are X\u00d7Spec()Spec( p)X \\underset{Spec(\\mathbb{Z})}{\\times}Spec(\\mathbb{Z}_p) (regarded so in Borger\u2019s absolute geometry by applying the Witt ring construction (W n) *(W_n)_\\ast to it).\n\n      This is what I had hoped that the definition\/characterization would be, so I am relieved. Because this is of course just the definition of synthetic differential geometry with Spec( p)Spec(\\mathbb{Z}_p) regarded as the ppth abstract formal disk.\n\n      Well, or at least this is what Buium defines. Borger instead calls (W n) *(W_n)_\\ast itself already the arithmetic jet space functor. I am not sure yet if I follow that.\n\n      I am hoping to realize the following: in ordinary differential geometry then synthetic differential infinity-groupoids is cohesive over \u201cformal moduli problems\u201d and here the flat modality \\flat is exactly the analog of the above \u201cjet space\u201d construction, in that it evaluates everything on formal disks. Moreover, \\flat canonically sits in a fracture suare together with the \u201ccohesive rationalization\u201d operation [\u03a0 dR(),][\\Pi_{dR}(-),-] and hence plays exactly the role of the arithmetic fracture square, but in smooth geometry. I am hoping that Borger\u2019s absolute geometry may be massaged into a cohesive structure over the base Et(Spec(\ud835\udd3d 1))Et(Spec(\\mathbb{F}_1)) that makes the cohesive fracture square reproduce the arithmetic one.\n\n      If Borger\u2019s absolute direct image were base change to Spec( p)Spec(\\mathbb{Z}_p) followed by the Witt vector construction, then this would come really close to being true. Not sure what to make of it being just that Witt vector construction. Presently I have no real idea of what good that actually is (apart from giving any base topos for Et(Spec(Z))Et(Spec(Z)), fine, but why this one? Need to further think about it.)\n\n    \u2022 I had started an entry \u201cexponentiation\u201d but then thought better of it and instead expanded the existing exponential object: added an examples-section specifically for SetSet and made some remarks on exponentiation of numbers.\n\n    \u2022 I would like to include something on wheeled properads (or wheeled PROPs) in the nlab. It seems to me that a wheeled prop is something like a symmetric monoidal category with duals for every object generated by one object. Is this right? Is there a place in the litterature where i can find the relation between wheeled properads used by Merkulov and some kinds of symmetric monoidal categories with duality?\n\n      Before changing the PROP entry to add this variant, i would like to have a nice reference on this.\n    \u2022 Although referred to in a couple of place, it seems we had no entry for spatial topos, so I\u2019ve made a start.\n\n    \u2022 A long time ago we had a discussion at graph about notions of morphism. I have written an article category of simple graphs which collects some properties of the category under one of those definitions (corresponding better, I think, to graph-theoretic practice).\n\n    \u2022 Created twosets20170617. Contains an svg illustration of a full subcategory of Set\\mathsf{Set} consisting of a terminal object and a two-element set. Uses the convention that an identity arrow is labelled by its object. Intended for use in some graph-theoretical considerations from an nPOV. Sufficiently general to be possibly of use in some other nLab articles too.\n\n    \u2022 Created a stub for internal type theory to collect some references. At some point we could move more from Mike\u2019s blog post.\n\n    \u2022 I changed \u201cirreflexive graph\u201d to \u201cdirected graph\u201d (aka quiver), as such a presheaf is more commonly known. (Irreflexive to my mind means loops at a vertex are forbidden.)\n\n    \u2022 Somehow we didn\u2019t yet have a page about pseudo-distributive laws, so I made a stubby one with a few examples and references.",

May 14, 2008 #1\n\n    Why is it that electron precession is not used in addition to proton precession in a proton precession magnetometer? It seems to me that when the frequencies are emitted as the protons precess that the electrons would do precessing at the same time and provide a secondary frequency to observe. Observing a second frequency would provide a better signal to noise for processing and perhaps may decay faster or slower providing a signal that is better at different times or different situations.

The corresponding eigenvalue determines how the length and sense of the arrow is changed by the operation.\n\nSpecifically, a non-zero column vector v is a (right) eigenvector of a matrix A if (and only if) there exists a number \u03bb such that Av = \u03bbv. The number \u03bb is called the eigenvalue corresponding to that vector. The set of all eigenvectors of a matrix, each paired with its corresponding eigenvalue, is called the eigensystem of that matrix.[1][2]\n\nPlease Promote Our Work and website through yoursocial and professional network.

        "text":"This conversation is closed.\n\nMath topics presented in a more engaging and unorthodox fashion.\n\nMath is already the most hated subject in schools and students have pinned math knowledge with a certain persona. The general persona is a monotone, nerd with no 'swagger'. This coupled with the rigor of the subject makes even the serious minded students tune out. This is a math lesson delivered as they've never seen nor expect. In music videos and various other forms of entertainment, a 'hood' figure who speaks with 'hood' vernacular is placed at the other end of the intelligence spectrum. This educator shows that where you come from does not speak to your intelligence or potential. Many agree that his delivery is unorthodox, interesting and rivals the explanations of seasoned professors. Some have professed that none of their collegiate educators delivered an explanation which could surpass the one given in the video. View the link and see if you agree with thousands thus far.\n\n\n  \u2022 thumb\n    Jun 13 2013: Here are our thirty-four TED Talks about Math. http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/tags\/math\n\n    The first, by a very energetic speaker, has had almost 5 million views! And he spoke again at TED Global today.\n\n    In my experience, math is presented in a very wide variety of ways by different teachers and speakers. There are great and engaging teachers and professors and weak ones. With such a wide range, and as mathematicians can have an eccentric streak, I don't think any mode of speaking about the subject can truly be called orthodox.\n    \u2022 Jun 14 2013: I guess there is a reply limit on here so I clicked on this one to reply to your last comment. As a matter of fact I am a math teacher. I suppose it wasn't very hard to tell. That theory sounds pretty good. The most problematic aspect of teaching inner city students is discipline. I honestly could not say whether or not I would be able to implement such a strategy because the biggest magic trick of all is getting them to actually care\/try. There could be gifted students in the mix but they are so taken by their environments that academics are the last items on the list of importance. If I could be so lucky to get 5 million views and resources to act, I know exactly how to change it. As of now, it's a daily battle and with the close of each year, I lose the war big time. I mean, some of them have genuine unbelievable circumstances to deal with at home. One student told me that their mom was up for 3 days as he witnessed a drug habit. Not to get too deep but I almost hugged the little guy because he deals with a lot to be so young. The worst part is that his story isn't at all unique. They all have crushing survival pressures, horrific environmental influences and a loss of will. Movies and television about this very thing tend to desensitize as we are no longer stunned by hardships but it is 10,000% real. At this point, I really don't know what to do for them. I know I went on a little rant here but hey....just figured I'd vent while speaking to a fellow educator.\n      \u2022 thumb\n        Jun 14 2013: It's not the place for me to address at length, but what worked pretty well for me in classrooms like you seem to have is to start the year by asking for a show of hands of who sees college as probably in the plan. Practically all say they do.\n\n        At that point I say that this is important for me to know, because we need to run the class to prepare them for that.\n\n        This conveys expectations that are useful and that, after all, came from what they told me their personal goals are.\n\n        You might try that in September.\n        \u2022 Jun 14 2013: This is not funny at all but sometimes all you can do is give one of those 'this makes no sense' laughs....when I ask about college, they don't even bother to raise their hand. It use to be that way about 7 years ago. They would raise their hand at least not to look bad. This is my last year teaching.\n  \u2022 thumb\n    Jun 21 2013: Learnig maths (or whatever) and also teaching in a nice way, is practical, pleasant, and (if they know how to do it well) useful. Sure.\n  \u2022 Jun 20 2013: LOl,I was good at math subject and I spent so much time to probe math's questions at school.And now my daughter likes math subject too.I can say some of students don't like math subject which isn't children's fault but math's teaching methods,curriculum...how do we apply math in reality?\n  \u2022 Comment deleted\n\n    \u2022 Jun 23 2013: you know of any books which go into more detail about this?\n  \u2022 Jun 17 2013: I watched the talk referenced by you. I found that the presentation in his explanation of the derivative in the differential calculus based on the conventional definition. I admire his clear presentation. but it's not an innovative approach. The dismal phenomenon of lack of interest in math by the students is not due to teaching, but it's due to the interference of the top-down from the education bureaucracy who tries to handcuff the teachers in how to teach, what to teach and shovel all the ineffective materials or regulations to deter students learning. Two examples:\n    The so-called common core teaching materials, especially in math, are full of idiotic explanations which are simply hard for the student to understand and impractical as well. An example is the equation; 1\/2 x 1\/3 = 1\/6. Most of the TEDsters believe that using the pizza slices analogy is both realistic and easy to understand. But the authors in the common core attacked this approach and came up with some impractical and hard to understand explanations.More of these kind of \"puzzles\" are certain to turn the students off.\n    Another example concerned with the new rules by the education authority to delay the teaching of Algebra I until the 9th grade. First of all, history shows that math should be learned as early in age as possible. There are plenty of prodigal youngsters who can reach the level of calculus or beyond at the age of 15 or even younger, but there are extremely few adults who could develop high math skills when they didn't have the proper foundation in math when they are already adults. Furthermore, what would we teach the students in the 7-8th grade. If the problems include relatively complex solutions, then the problems can easily be solved by algebraic equations, but they have not been taught at that time. If we lay off the students on that, then it is equivalent to give THE STUDENTS A SLACK in progress during the optimal time for learning. In both cases, we turn them off of math!\n  \u2022 Jun 13 2013: Thanks for the reference. I will check them out.....I agree. Math is typically very unorthodox but to the masses of people who hate the mere mentioning of the subject, it can be dim to say the least.\n    \u2022 thumb\n      Jun 13 2013: I notice children typically like or even love math as long as the problems are easy and they can do them with minimal effort. Part of why people start not liking math is that people don't always enjoy making mistakes and being told they have made mistakes.\n      \u2022 Jun 13 2013: Yeah that's true. Once they have to do more than 3 steps to get to the answer then it's like pulling teeth. At some point, they just have to realize that it is the glory of thinking your way through that fuels the process.\n        \u2022 thumb\n          Jun 13 2013: Just in case you are a math teacher, there is a great little book I read a long time ago called Thinking Mathematically, by John Mason. One of the key ideas is that to get students hooked on math, you have to get them to experience the stuck-stuck-stuck- Breakthrough! experience.\n\n          For this you have to hit just the right level of difficult so that they will get stuck... stuck...stuck... but then break through, producing that elated feeling that gets addictive. and you take them there over and over again.\n\n          That's my secret anyway. Notice it is an intrinsic thing.",

Mar 27, 2009 #2\n    To understand why that is not correct, you have to know what closure of an operator over a set means.\n\n    A set S is closed under a binary operator + iff for all x, y in S, x + y is in S.\n\n    A = {0, 2} isn't closed under addition because the definition is not satisfied. We can find a counter example where x and y are both in S, but x + y is not. The counter example is with x = 2 and y = 2.\n  4. Mar 27, 2009 #3\n    Closed means you can do it to any two (possibly non-unique) elements and get an answer in your set.\n\n    S = {0, 2} doesn't work since 2+2=4 is not in S.\n  5.

        "text":"Spelling of personal names in botanical nomenclature; was RE: Haemanthus and Scadoxus Culture\n\nJim McKenney jimmckenney@jimmckenney.com\nMon, 28 Jun 2010 10:19:37 PDT\n\nYears ago on this list, a sharp eyed reader noticed that someone had  used\nthe \u201can\u201d form of the indefinite article before a genus name which began with\nH. Sharp-eyed reader commented something on the order of \u201cnow I know how you\npronounce the name: with a silent H. \u201c\n\nThis points to one probable source of the lack of clarity in the code with\nrespect to the treatment of names. There are at least two schools of thought\nwhen it comes to the answer to the question \u201cwhat does \u201cname\u201d mean in this\ncontext?\u201d. Does \u201cname\u201d in this context refer to  the spoken form of the name\nor to the written form of the name? \n\nChris Whitehouse correctly pointed out that the name Katharine is ultimately\nderived from Greek. But in the English language, what seems to be the same\nname has dropped two of the original four  syllables, has given new sounds\nto the retained vowels, and has introduced a sound for the th which did not\nexist in Greek. Furthermore (and this aspect is particularly important for\npurposes of plant nomenclature) the spoken form of the name as spoken in\nEnglish ends in a consonant sound (an \u201cn\u201d sound); the written form ends in a\nwritten but silent (in English) vowel. \n\nAll of this would be irrelevant except for one thing. One of the\npeculiarities of the rules (at least as I read them) is that the rules seem\nto be relying on  principles of euphony  traditional in the study of the\nclassical languages, but these rules are applied to the written word with no\nregard for the sounds the written characters represent. The word euphony\nimplies sound: the sound comes first, the spelling follows. Spelling changes\nto reflect euphonic sensibilities.\n\nBut in the world of scientific nomenclature, almost every one has lost touch\nwith the SOUNDS of classical Latin and Greek. But that has not stopped them\nfrom attempting to apply rules of euphony specific to Latin and Greek (and\nbased on those sounds)  to the written form of scientific terms, including\nsometimes botanical names. The result can be comically anorthographic, is\ngenerally offensive to the trained ear and sometimes displays an ignorance\nof the sense of the very rules of euphony evoked to produce the spellings in\n\nEnough of this rant! But Chris did mention one other thing which tempts me\nto open another can of worms: Chris alluded to the fact that for purposes of\nplant nomenclature some names are declined and some are not. We could have a\nlot of fun with that one, too: any one else game? \n\nJim McKenney\nMontgomery County, Maryland, USA, 39.03871\u00ba North, 77.09829\u00ba West, USDA zone\n7, where if we continue this topic I'll get Cr\u00e9pin and Max Wichrua involved.\n\nMy Virtual Maryland Garden http:\/\/www.jimmckenney.com\/\nBLOG! http:\/\/mcwort.blogspot.com\/\nWebmaster Potomac Valley Chapter, NARGS \nEditor PVC Bulletin http:\/\/www.pvcnargs.org\/ \nWebmaster Potomac Lily Society http:\/\/www.potomaclilysociety.org\/\n\nMore information about the pbs mailing list",
