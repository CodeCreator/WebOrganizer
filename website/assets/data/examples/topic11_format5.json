The tracker should properly distinguish between the different accounts just fine. It will currently all show up in one feed on your user page, but even if you do half of a draft of one account then switch to the other, they should be tracked properly. There is a dropdown to select accounts on the collections page, as those are tracked separately as well.\n\nCan I use 17Lands on two computers for the same account?\n\nYes! As long as you have the 17Lands software always running in the background (or are very careful to run it before switching computers), using the same account across multiple computers should be no problem.\n\nMissing Data\n\nI installed and ran the tracker. Why isn't all my data showing up on the site?\n\nThe log files we need get cleared every time Arena starts, so we can only go back as far as your most recent Arena session. If you've done drafts since installing 17Lands and still aren't seeing any data, please try the following troubleshooting steps before reaching out for help:\n\nI forgot to run the tracker for my last draft so the data isn't showing up.

You thus get to keep the Tavern Card you receive in addition to the 2 gold.\n\nHow do you split the fame gained from defeating a Legendary Pirate, if several players participated in the attack?\nThe fame gets divided equally (and rounded down, if necessary) between all surviving players at the moment the Legendary Pirate or Royal Navy gets defeated.\n\nIn the rules, what does westward mean exactly?\n-Westward means clockwise, in ascending numerical order, starting from Tavern Island (# 1), and finishing up with Treasure Island (#6) and Pirate's Cove.\n\nCan I play the Royal Navy on my own Island (to help me defeat an enemy, for instance, or to acquire additional fame)?\nNo you can't. You can only tip off her Royal Majesty's ships to another Pirate's hideaway than the one you moor at.\n\nCan you make repairs on your ship, even if it was not crippled when it fled to Pirate's Cove?\nNo you can't, nor can you repair a section that was not damaged below the water line (i.e. whose strength marker wasn't pushed off-board)\n\nWhat is the exact meaning of \"booty\" on the Consort event card?\nBooty means all the spoils from the plunder, ie not only treasures, but also all gold, fame and tavern cards potentially collected.",

People are confused about is lottery games are legal or illegal.\nNowadays, a different question raises due to the increased popularity of online gambling in India. The law that regulates the gambling game in India designed in 1987, and this law called \u201cThe Public Gambling Act.\u201d According to this act, all the gambling game except for skill game was illegal. But in this, online gambling not included. This act came the same as in 2000.\n\nWhen the Information Technology Act came out, in this act, the online gambling game does not classify as illegal. Online Lottery Game was legalized in 1998 in some states of India. The lottery site is entirely legal in\u00a0Punjab, Manipur, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Assam, West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Goa.\n\nHow to Play Online Lottery Game in India?\n\nThere are many online sites of lottery games in India. You have enough money to purchase the ticket. There is no guarantee once you are buying the lottery ticket, you just won the game it depends on your luck. For playing games first, you choose the appropriate site; then, you must make registration on site. Then you select the lottery game that you want to play and purchase the lottery tickets. You also required a credit card, bank account, or an e-wallet to purchase the ticket.\n\nTips for choosing the best lottery site\n\nThe purchasing of an online lottery ticket is straightforward as you purchase other things online from another site. Don\u2019t worry; we listed a few things that kept in mind before choosing the location for buying tickets. These are following as:\n\n  \u2022 The first important thing to focus on whether the site is trustable and safe. For this, you must read the reviews of the customer on the website and discuss it with an experienced person that already uses a different site for purchasing lottery tickets.\n  \u2022 Then you focus on the assortment and diversity of games that operator has.\n  \u2022 Prefer to choose those sites that provide customer support.\n  \u2022 The website has many different options.\n  \u2022 They are easy to find, stable, and friendly with mobile and other devices.\n  \u2022 The website is also a great value.\n  \u2022 Site up-to-date regularly and provide lottery news, games, and the latest daily draw result.\n  \u2022 Provide the winning prize securely and effectively to the winner.\n  \u2022 The site has an excellent past result.\n\n\nMinimum age to play online lottery game in India?\n\nAs we already discussed, the act of gambling game was a bit tangled. Same as in the minimum age of players to play the game. The age explained in different sites varies between 18 to 21. To play the lottery game legally in India, the minimum age of the player must be at least 18 years old.\n\nDreaming based on the result... (truncated)",

From fictitious graveyards to s'mores designed in Morse code to music clips containing a hidden message, anything is possible to encounter when playing in the DASH puzzle hunt.\n\nAll teams across the world will be working on the same 10 puzzles over the course of a max of 8-hours.\u00a0\n\nPuzzles will not be labor intensive, aside from moving between locations, which will be within a few blocks of each other.\n\nWhen and Where?\n\nSign-in will be open at 9:30AM with opening remarks at 9:45AM. Puzzling will begin at 10:00AM and is expected to end no later than 6:00PM, Eastern time. Experienced teams may finish faster.\n\nThe start location will be Nelson Rockefeller Park at the west-most point of Warren Street (and River Terrace). There is a pivilion there where the day will kick-off.\n\nHow many people should be on my team?\n\nThe optimal size for a team is 3-5 players.

Hack 'n Slash\nStat\/Skill cap\n\nPvP (Player Versus Player):\nPvP is strictly banned within the limits of a town or city, even if guard protection is not present. It is also strictly banned in mining areas and against new players. The murder or attempt of murder on a fellow player, if they meet the above criteria, is strictly punished on Eternal Lands. Under the law of these lands, your character can be punished anywhere from a fine to execution, depending on the offense. PvPing IS allowed, however, in a Role Playing environment. You can PvP if, say, you are in a guild and are fighting another guild, if you are on an official quest to kill a player (including official tournaments of entertainment), or both parties agree beforehand to participate in PvP. Report unlawful PvPing to a GM via .page or email contact.\n\nStat\/Skill cap:\nAll skills can be GMed, the Stat Sum of your stats can not exceed 375.\n\nThe GMs of the shard do not condone macroing, although it is not outlawed. This said, however, if, for example, you are macroing, are killed for whatever reason, and your body decays because you\u2019re inattentive or simply can\u2019t be reached, no official will help you.\n\nCheating, hacks, and bug exploitations are strictly outlawed. Anyone suspected of participating in these activities will be thoroughly questioned, and can face deletion of their character and\/or a permanent or temporary ban from all Eternal Lands servers.\n\nAll players are expected to act in a civilized manor, especially within city limits. If the Role of your character conflicts with this, you are still encouraged to pursue this role, but don\u2019t be surprised if you are met with animosity by fellow players. Any reports of abuse on a player (such as real life threats or insults) will be met with swift and harsh action. Report any player relation problems to a GM immediately.\n\nIn the times of turmoil Eternal Lands takes place in, there is still hope of a civilized society. All players who are suspected of a crime punishable by more than 1,500 gold may enjoy a trial, with a presiding GM and, in some instances, a panel of fellow, anonymous, players. Use .page or email to request an inquiry.\n\nUseful commands:\nSome commands players are granted are .map and .time, with more to come. Look for, in the future, a .commands command that will give you a list of available actions.\n\nHelp Desk From Hell:\nDo not use this feature! Doing so will place you in Eternal limbo. To get out .page or email a GM.\n\nRole Playing Vs. Hack \u2018n Slash:\nAll players are encouraged to become the role of a character in the world. Develop a persona, perhaps join a guild, and generally act in character. Of course every player plays in their own style, but we feel that an all around Role Playing environment would be much more fun.\n\nBoats are available from the store right near the Vesper docks. Boats are (albeit expensive) very fast and useful.\n\nThe GMs have created a detailed plot for the Eternal Lands server, and it will be revealed as the server and its players evolve.\n\nBritain Locked Off!?:\nYes, this is part of the plot, and a huge quest someday soon will open up the areas.\n\nFor now, players must ride or run to different places. Although many players are used to the \u201chop in a teleporter\u201d travel of style, we\u2019ve found that once you get used to traveling the \u201cold fashioned way\u201d to where you want to go, you enjoy it more (plus you see interesting people and things on the way).\n\nFree GM Skills and such:\nMany players seem to expect that upon joining Eternal Lands they are entitled to a free skill, money, or some other goodie. Although this may be the case in other servers, we don\u2019t give hand outs of that type here. The fact that you have two dedicated GMs who care very much so for the development of the server and the happiness of its inhabitants should be a great enough gift in itself!\n\nSure, it gets dark, what do you expect when the sun goes down? Carry a torch or learn to cast the level 1 Mage spell Nightsight. (You can always hack a tree up with a sword and dagger to create a torch or kindling).\n\nNo Email Registration:\nWe find it a hassle to have to get every player accepted via email, and also feel that it works out best for everyone if you can just log in the first time quickly. However, if this system is abused, we will switch over to a more anal retentive system, probably email registration. Some examples of abuse would be creating more than one account or creating a bunch of accounts just for the heck of it.",

        "text":"Beat It! Pole Position [arcade]\nby Robert Guerra\n[Appeared in the August\/September 1983 issue of \"Video Games Player\"]\n        Every so often a game comes along that sets the standard to which all \nother games of its type are compared. Donkey Kong is the model for climbing \ncontests. Defender, the definitive horizontally-scrolling space shoot-'em-up. \nWith Pole Position, Atari has set another standard. One qualifying lap around \nFuji Speedway and you'll know that video races have changed forever.\n        As the driver of a Formula 1 racer, you are required to maneuver \naround the 2.709 mile course in a breathtaking race against the clock, and \nother racers. Only if you do well enough in the qualifying heat are you \nallowed to participate in the actual race. How well you do on the qualifying \nlap determines which of eight starting positions you will be given. Only the\nvery best drivers are awarded the pole position.\n\nThe Course\n\n        At the beginning of each game, you are shown a map of the course. You \nbegin on a long straightaway. The first turn is a fairly sharp right which \nleads, almost immediately, into an easily handled left. This is followed by a \nright that brings you to the most difficult turn of the course--a left \nhairpin that will test even the most advanced driver's ability. Master this \nturn, and you're guaranteed high scores. The final curve is a long gradual \nright which deposits you back on the original straightaway.\n        As in real driving, there are road signs along the side of the track \nwhich warn you of upcoming curves. Also included are billboards and a \npicturesque view of the foothills of Mount Fuji. Don't get carried away with \nthe scenery, however. You'll need all your concentration.\n\n\n        Upon successful completion of the qualifying lap, you will have \naccumulated 10,000 points. If the lap is completed in less than 73 game \nseconds (which click off at twice the speed of real time), you will be given \na starting position and bonus points as follows:\n LAP TIME          POSITION          BOMUS\n  58.50              1               4000\n  60.00              2               2000\n  62.00              3               1400\n  64.00              4               1000\n  66.00              5                800\n  68.00              6                600\n  70.00              7                400\n  73.00              8                200\n        Each car passed during the race is good for 50 extra points. In \naddition, when you reach the checkered flag you will receive 200 points for \nevery unused second.\n\nThe Qualifying Lap\n        The best way to approach the qualifying lap is to go for broke. \nThis means getting tne racer into high gear at the appropriate time and \nkeeping it there. Also, because there is less traffic during the qualifying \nlap than in the actual race, you should keep the pedal to the floor throughout \nalmost the entire course. The one exception is that left hairpin. \n        When you get the green starting light, be sure the car is in low gear \nand the accelerator is down as far as it will go. Keep one eye on the \nspeedometer and shift into high as soon as you reach the 100 mph mark.\n        The first turn can be tricky at close to 180 mph, but with a little \npractice, you'll learn exactly how hard to cut it to minimize sliding. Since \nyou're not yet into traffic, approach this turn from the center of the track \nand lean into it just a touch early. Straighten the car immediately as you \ncome onto the short straightaway which follows.\n        The next two curves (left, then right) can also be handled at top \nspeed, although you'll have to pass a number of cars to do it. To pass on the \ncurves, position your racer in the open lane and hold the wheel as steady as \npossible as you ease past the other car. Any lane changes should be done \ngradually. Remember, at 180 mph a little steering wheel movement goes a long\n        As you come into that dangerous left hairpin, you have to reduce \nspeed slightly to avoid slamming into other racers. Taking this turn too fast \ncan also send you sliding off the track into a green \"Centipede\" billboard. \nEither option will result in a fiery crash which, while spectacular \ngraphically, is not worth losing your life for.\n        When you see the turn approaching, ease up slightly on the gas. This \nwill give you enough distance from the other cars to spin the wheel hard to \nthe left and slide through the turn without losing too much time.\n        The following curve and eventual straightaway will pose no problem as \nlong as you pass carefully and maintain smooth control over the racer. This is \nespecially important when threading the needle between two cars which are \nside-by-side. If there is enough room to do this (there usually is), get \ndirectly in the center of the track and keep the wheel rock-steady as you \nblow by them. If you know you won't make it, stay on their tails until \nthere's room to pass.\n        Although you will be given between 90 and 120 seconds to finish the \nlap (depending on the settings the arcade owner has chosen), to qualify for \nthe race you need a time of 73.00 or better.\n\nThe Race\n\n        You begin in a double row of eight cars. Positions two, four, six, and \neight are lined up in the left lane, and one, three, five, and seven on the \nright. Even though you may pull out ahead of this pack, you will encounter \nmore traffic as you proceed through the course.\n        During the race, other racers will frequently change lanes, so be \nready to change accordingly. As soon as you see the closest car in front of \nyou begin to drift into your lane, gradually move your car in the opposite\ndirection, into the lane he's vacating. \n        You will also encounter wet spots on the course this time around. \nSince they don't significantly reduce your speed or interfere with the \nhandling of your racer, don't go out of your way to avoid them. \n        Unless you are starting in one of the first two positions, you will \nhave to weave your way to the front of the pack on the beginning straightaway. \nTry to maintain top speed through as much of the course as possible. One of \nthc most common mistakes people make is unnecessary down-shifting. If you must \nslow down to avoid a collislon, use gour gas pedal.\n        The one spot where you will have to shift into low is that dangerous \nleft. Just before you reach it, ease up on the gas and kick it into low. Once \nyou're into the turn, floor it while cutting the wheel as hard as possible. \nThe instant you know you've made it, shift into high and head for the \nfinish line.\n\nExtended Play\n\n        If you complete the first race lap in the time allotted (usually\n75 seconds), 45 seconds will be added to your unused time and you may continue \nto race. As you cross the start\/finish line and collect the additional time, \ndon't slow down. If you can complete another lap, your racing time will be \nextended again. You can race up to a maximum of three or four laps depending \non the machine's internal settings.\nTips From The Pit\n        * Hold the inside lane through as much of the course as possible.\n        * Don't be afraid to drive on the grass to avoid a collision.\n        * Always wait until your speed reaches 100 mph before shifting into \n          high gear.    \n        * Finally, if you do crash, get going again as quickly as possible. \n          A slow start will cause you to get hit from behind.\n        * Go out there and blow the doors off those other guys.\nMinimum Score Potential: 60,000\n\n[Scanned and edited by Dennis Brown --]",

        "text":"The official website for\nthe world of Catan\n\nQuestion about Base Game End of the Game - Is there another special building phase at the end of the game?\n\n\n  \u2022 No \u2013 if a player reaches the required number of victory points during his turn, the game ends as specified in the rules.\n  \u2022 Yes \u2013 if the game ends at a point agreed upon by the players before or during the game, after which each player \u2013 beginning with the starting player \u2013 may take one more turn, that is, the game ends when player 5 or 6 has taken his turn.\n    In this case, it is recommended to include another special building phase after player 5 or 6 has finished his turn, so that the players can use the resources they just have received. Otherwise, the last player to take a turn is at a disadvantage, because no one will trade with him any more. The order in which the players take their turns would have too much bearing on the outcome of the game, because during the last round the number of trades performed would diminish player by player \u2013 after all, why should a player who is no longer allowed to build keep on trading?\n    This rule is also recommended for 3-4 player games, because otherwise the last player would hardly have an opportunity to trade. Therefore, in a 3-4 player game, a one-time final build phase for all other players would take place.",

This information has been specifically made\navailable in a separate guide from my V-Rally 3: Game Guide\nso that those who do not wish to view its details in the Game\nGuide will not see it.\n\nPlease note that some of the information in this guide comes\nfrom my V-Rally 3: Game Guide.\n\n\nHere, the player must complete various challenges. Challenge\nMode sets the player on three or more stages (of which only\nthe first four sectors are used for the challenges), which\nmust all be completed within a specified time limit. The\nstages are not necessarily from the same rally, meaning that\nthe player will likely be presented with vastly different\nterrain types in different countries, all within the same\n\nFirst, the player must select a driver; at least one driver\nmust be available in order to play V-Rally 3. Then the\nplayer can select a challenge from among those presented (by\nusing the left and right buttons on the D-pad), and view the\ncar used for the challenge.\n\nNext, the player is shown the times to beat for the\nchallenge. The player can also customize the car's tuning.\nThen, the player heads to the first stage of the challenge.\n\nFollowing the first stage, the player is shown the\nperformance (time) and given the opportunity to view a\nreplay, and then is allowed to prepare in the same manner for\nthe second stage; this repeats for all the stages. Upon the\ncompletion of the final stage of a challenge, the player may\nbe shown a trophy presentation and given the name of the next\n\nPlease note that some challenges must be completed with a\nspecific vehicle, whereas other challenges will allow the\nplayer to choose from a small selection of vehicles. Also,\nonce a challenge has been successfully passed, the next\nchallenge in the series will become available, and all\nprevious challenges can also be selected.\n\n\nChallenge Mode comprises several vehicle-specific challenges,\nthen a pair of tire-manufacturer challenges (in which the\nplayer can choose from a selection of permitted vehicles).\nOnce these five default challenges have all been successfully\npassed, the player will unlock Extra Challenges, which allows\nfor the creation of unique challenges using one or more\nvehicles selected by the player.\n\nCreating unique challenges is somewhat straightforward.\nFirst, a name can be selected on the Name screen. Permitted\nvehicles are then selected on the Cars screen. Damage can be\ntoggled between Off and On. When ready, the player can\nselect OK to move ahead.\n\nA few notes are warranted here on the selection of permitted\nvehicles from the Cars screen.\n1.) There are four categories: All, 2.0L 4WD, 1.6L FWD,\nand Bonus Cars. Selecting any of these categories\nmeans that the player will only be permitted to use\nthe vehicles in that category. This also means that\nif a player has not yet unlocked all the bonus cars,\nthen she or he will be limited to those bonus cars\nalready acquired in the game should Bonus Cars be\n2.) Selecting any specific vehicle means that the player\nwill be limited to using that vehicle for the created\nchallenge. Only those bonus cars which have already\nbeen unlocked will be available for individual\nselection in this manner.\n\nIn the next step, the player can add stages to the created\nchallenge. A stage in Finland is available by default, with\nits default time to beat listed on the far-right of the\ninitial line; selecting this line (the first line) allows for\nthat initial stage to be modified on a pop-up sub-screen.\nHere, the player can change the country (remember that the\nentire continent of Africa is treated as a single country in\nV-Rally 3), track (all forward-direction tracks for each\ncountry are listed before that country's reverse-direction\ntracks), and the time to beat (adjusted in 5% intervals up to\na 15% differential).\n\nAdding new stages is done by selecting Add, and a new\nFinland-default line appears. Selecting this line allows for\nthe player to make changes.\n\nUnfortunately, each stage has its own specified\nweather\/lighting conditions, which cannot be changed in Extra\nChallenges :-( It would be quite interesting, for example,\nto create a challenge where ALL stages are run through Africa\nat nighttime, or ALL stages run in France in severe foggy\n\nShould a player later wish to edit or delete\/erase a created\nchallenge, this can be done from the Extra Challenges sub-\nmenu. Any attempt to delete\/erase a created challenge will\nbe 'cautioned' with a verification screen.\n\nOnce the player has created a challenge, it is then\nselectable from the Challenges: Select sub-menu. All player-\ncreated challenges will appear after the five default\nchallenges (i.e., after the Michelin Challenge).\n\nUnfortunately, the record times for any created challenges\nare not shown on the Records screen, nor do they appear in a\ndriver's Pressbook :-(\n\n\nFor questions, rants, raves, comments of appreciation, etc.,\nor to be added to my e-mail list for updates to this driving\nguide, please contact me at: FEATHER7@IX.NETCOM.COM; also, if\nyou have enjoyed this guide and feel that it has been helpful\nto you, I would certainly appreciate a small donation via\nPayPal (https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/) using the above e-mail\n\nTo find the latest version of this and all my other\nPSX\/PS2\/DC\/Mac game guides, visit FeatherGuides at\n\n\nWolf Feather Jamie Stafford\nJust as there are many parts needed to make a human a human, there's a\nremarkable number of things needed to make an individual what they are.\n- Major Kusanagi, _Ghost in the Shell_\nWhat isn't remembered never happened. - _Serial Experiments Lain_\n\nIn This Article\n\nV-Rally \/ Checkered Flag\n\nV-Rally \/ Checkered Flag\n\nA two-pack of portable racing games.\nGenres:Compilation, Racing, Simulation\nSuitable for Persons Ages Six and Older, Mild Language\nPlatforms:Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, GameCube\nDevelopers:Eden Games, VD-Dev\nPublishers:Infogrames, ACE (2), Ingram Entertainment, Atari\nFeatures:Number Of Players, Memory Card, Vibration, DualShock, 480p, Steering Wheel Support\nRelease Date:October 17, 2002",

Let us know!\n\n[OFFICIAL] FAQ about forums, contacts, game -- read first :)\n\nPostby Nandrew on Sat Jun 11, 2011 8:30 am\n\n\nA: Fear not! Get a hold of us via info@qcfdesign.com for crash reports, account inquiries and all that other madness which raises its head during beta. We promise we won't bite you!\n\nQ: Uh, I don't know the answer to your forum signup challenge.\nA: The animal you're looking for also happens to be an admin bot on our forums who posts the weekly update thread. Lurk for a lil' and you'll find it. :)\n\nQ: Okay, signed in, but my forum posts aren't showing up! Do you hate me?\nA: Patience, young goatslayer! We have a manual approval system for first-time posters to avoid spambot flux and obviously trolling and whatnot. It may take a day or two to approve your first post, depending on when we check the forums to see it. Smooth sailing after that, though.\n\nQ: Will you make an iPhone\/Android\/PC\/Mac\/BlackBerry\/Croissant\/Hobo\/Linux version of the game?\nA: PC\/Mac, web, iPhone and Android: Yes! Everything else, no. Unless Unity starts supporting baked goods as a platform. Console support is something that\u2019s outside of our hands, it depends on platform owners and all that sort of complicated stuff \u2013 we just want to get the game out there.\n\nQ: Is Desktop Dungeons going to be on Steam?\nA: We\u2019re planning to get on Steam as soon as we possibly can. So, barring any horrible mishaps, yes. And Steam are pretty cool about translating pre-orders into Steam keys, too.\n\nQ: I see the Beta is running in my browser. What gives?\nA: The Beta is going to be changing very often, as we update is with bug fixes and new content. To prevent us from having to send out endless patches, we\u2019re going to keep it on the web during the beta phase, making roll-out much easier. Once the full is launched, there will be a stand-alone and a web client, and your save games will persist across both (given internet access)\n\nQ: This game is great! How can I give you guys money?\nA: There\u2019s this \u201cbuy\u201d link on the main site. Click it!\n\nQ: Will you fix X, Y or Z in the freeware version?\nA: No. Those things are all fixed in the full game. We had to rewrite everything anyway.\n\nQ: This is way too hard, how do I stop dying?!\nA: There\u2019s a forum! There\u2019s a wiki! There are even helpful videos.\nUser avatar\nPosts: 569\nJoined: Fri Mar 25, 2011 5:59 pm\n\nReturn to Support\n\nWho is online\n\nUsers browsing this forum: No registered users and 1 guest",
