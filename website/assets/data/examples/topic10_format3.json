(NOTE: Masks are required at all times, even outside, unless seated at a table or actively participating in a tasting) All indoor tastings should be reserved ahead of time online or by calling the winery.\u00a0Click this banner for full details about changes to our tasting procedures.\n\n\u00a0Wine Tasting GlassesTaste & Tour\n\n\nYour experience at Wagner Vineyards for a wine tasting should be fun, educational, delicious, and safe. We have some new health and safety requirements for employees and visitors at the winery to help keep you and our staff and families safe. All indoor tastings now require a reservation, regardless of the number of tasters, to help us maintain social distancing within the building as well as to allow for cleaning between scheduled tastings. Visit our Online Reservation page to schedule your visit now. We are not currently taking reservations for flights at the outdoor picnic tables \u2013 picnic tables are first-come-first-served and the flights can be purchased at the outdoor bar (note: masks are required when ordering at the outdoor bar).\n\nFor everyone\u2019s health and safety\n\nOn the day of your tasting, if you are feeling unwell, please stay home. We are asking the same of our staff and each day, when arriving at work, all staff members will take their temperature and will not be permitted to work if they are showing any symptoms of a virus. When you arrive at the winery for your tasting, be sure to bring a mask. Masks are required at all times on the premises unless you are sitting at a table or actively participating in a tasting. Please note, that masks must also be worn outside when not seated at a table.\u00a0You will find touchless hand sanitizing stations throughout the facility and we encourage everyone, guests and staff alike, to sanitize often, and especially before a tasting. In addition to the safeguards mentioned above, we will have in place various additional precautions during your tastings as well as throughout the facility for the duration of your visit.\n\nWhat to expect during your wine tasting\n\nWagner Vineyards offers more than 30 wines, so you are sure to find something to suit your palate here. We focus on \u201cCustomer Choice\u201d tastings where we work with you to select the wines you\u2019ll most enjoy. Wine tastings are $8 and include a sampling of 5 wines, a complimentary glass to take home, and a coupon for $4 off a purchase of $25 or more. During your tasting, you will notice a plexiglass barrier separating our staff from you for everyone\u2019s safety as this is one of the few times you are permitted to remove your mask. In addition to the plexiglass, our staff members will wear masks at all times while pouring and serving.\n\nVisiting the winery after your tasting (or without a tasting)\n\nVisitors are welcome to use the picnic tables outside, weather permitting, to enjoy wine by the glass, flight, or bottle or beer by the pint or flight. The picnic tables have been placed at a minimum of 6 feet apart and there is a maximum of 8 people allowed per table. The tables should not be moved. At this time, we are not taking reservations for the outdoor picnic tables and they can be used on a first-come-first-served basis.\n\nShould you have any questions or concerns about visiting the winery for a tasting, please feel free to contact us through the form on our contact page or call us at 607-582-6450.\n\nGuided Winery Tours\n\nAt this time, we are unable to offer guided winery tours on a daily basis.

        "text":"New Yorker Bagels\n\nBagel Handling Instructions\n\nYou gotta treat us like one of your own\u2026\n\nThis is a fresh, all-natural product made with love in New York City. Since there are no preservatives of any kind, leaving these out for more than 1 day will make \u2018em stale.\n\nEnjoy a fresh bagel or two now, and freeze the rest. These fresh bagels freeze wonderfully, and will last a full year when frozen.\u00a0\n\nYo \u2013 I\u2019m dyin\u2019 in here!\n\nFor both protection and as a convenient way to freeze, we place our bagels in plastic sleeves after cooling. BUT\u2026 the lack of air in the plastic sleeve can affect quality in transit, especially in warm weather.\u00a0\n\nTake your bagels out of the plastic bag and \u2013 like a fine Chianti \u2013 let \u2018em breathe for 15 minutes prior to eating or toasting. This exposure to air helps restore the proper consistency throughout.\u00a0\n\nTurn up \u2018da heat\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to enjoy another fresh bagel after freezing:\u00a0\n\n  1. Take out of the freezer and thaw on-counter \u2013 for about 30 minutes\n  2. Preheat your over to 400\u00b0\n  3. Place bagels on a baking pan and bake for 4 minutes\n\nThis method will provide the crispy outside and soft chewy inside of an authentic New York City bagel. (Any bagels not enjoyed after heating up this way, must be discarded - ain\u2019t there always a catch?)\n\nNo Nukes\n\nNothing destroys the proper texture and consistency of a real bagel like microwaving \u2013 please don\u2019t use the microwave. Don\u2019t make me tell ya twice\u2026\u00a0\n\nAny Questions? Contact us at or email Thank you.",
