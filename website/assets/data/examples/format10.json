However, shareholders may be disappointed with the price, which is nearly $500m less than Countrywide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value on Thursday. Because it is an all-stock transaction, Countrywide's investors will benefit if BofA stock rises.\n\n    For BofA, buying Countrywide is a bet that it can salvage its $2bn investment in a preferred stock issued by the company in August - BofA paid $18 a share for a 16% stake.\n\n  \u2022 The Wall Street Journal\n\n    BofA, which has more than $100bn in its own home-equity loans, would be taking on another $32.5bn in Countrywide home-equity loans. Though Countrywide has virtually stopped making sub-prime loans, it has exposure to its past originations. As of September 30, Countrywide's savings bank held $26.8bn of option adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\n  \u2022 New York Post\n\n    BofA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anticipated proposal to rescue Countrywide would also come as a relief to federal regulators.\n\n    By purchasing Countrywide, BofA would prevent the largest US mortgage lender from filing for bankruptcy and thereby avert significant damage to the home-loan market - a mess the US Federal Reserve and other agencies desperately want to avoid, analysts said, and one that poses far greater risks to the economy than mortgage industry consolidation.\n\nEmail this article to a friend\n\nPlease enter the recipients email address for who you wish to send this article to.\n\n\nOther press digests in this section",

        "text":"British embassy in Tehran reopens four years after closure\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\nMedia captionJeremy Bowen reports on the thawing of relations between the UK and Iran\n\nThe British embassy in Iran has reopened, nearly four years after it was closed.\n\nForeign Secretary Philip Hammond attended a ceremony in Tehran with Iranian diplomats to mark the reopening while Iran has also reopened its embassy in London.\n\nThe UK embassy was closed in 2011 after it was stormed by protesters during a demonstration against sanctions.\n\nMr Hammond is the first UK foreign secretary to visit Iran since 2003.\n\nThe reopening comes weeks after Iran reached a deal with six world powers aimed at curbing its nuclear programme.\n\n'Important milestones'\n\nAt the ceremony Mr Hammond said the attack in 2011 had been \"a low point\" but since the election of President Hassan Rouhani things had \"steadily improved, step by step\".\n\nImage caption Mr Hammond said it was a historic moment in UK-Iran relations\n\nHe said: \"Last month's historic nuclear agreement was another milestone, and showed the power of diplomacy, conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect, to solve shared challenges.\n\n\"Re-opening the embassy is the logical next step. To build confidence and trust between two great nations.\n\n\"Iran is, and will remain, an important country in a strategically important but volatile region. Maintaining dialogue around the world, even under difficult conditions, is critical.\"\n\nEarlier Mr Hammond told the BBC there was a \"big deficit of trust\" with Iran, and \"major issues on which we have fundamental differences of view\".\n\n\"But the symbolic importance of deciding to reopen embassies in each other's countries, is that we have chosen to talk to each other about those differences... to look for areas where our interests do align,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright AFP \/ Getty\nImage caption The British embassy in Tehran, seen here in 2003, has been closed since 2011\n\nInitially, the embassy will be headed by a charge d'affaires, Ajay Sharma, but Mr Hammond said an agreement on upgrading to full ambassador status is expected to be reached in the coming months.\n\nA trade delegation has also travelled to Tehran with Mr Hammond and the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Damian Hinds to discuss possible future trade opportunities.\n\nMr Hammond said there was \"huge appetite\" from UK businesses interested in investing in Iran and creating conditions for British banks to be able to finance trade deals with the country.\n\nIn London, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw attended the opening of the Iranian embassy in South Kensington.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\nImage caption Mr Straw spoke with Iran's deputy foreign minister Mehdi Danesh Yazdi at the event in London\n\nHe told the BBC News Channel: \"It's a very important day for relations between Iran and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Relations have always been quite difficult, and they reached a further nadir in 2011, but this is really good news.\"\n\nIn November 2011 Iran announced it was expelling the UK's ambassador in retaliation for British support for tougher sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme.\n\nHundreds of protesters stormed embassy compounds two days later, smashing windows, torching cars and burning union jacks.\n\nThe UK responded by closing the Iranian embassy in London later that month.\n\nImage copyright AFP\nImage caption The British embassy in Tehran was stormed by protestors in 2011\n\nBut following the election of Hassan Rouhani and an agreement on how to deal with Iran's nuclear programme, the then Foreign Secretary William Hague proposed the reopening of the embassy in June last year.\n\nSince then, the reopening of the embassy has been held up by technical problems over visa policy and communications equipment, Mr Hammond has said.\n\nInside the embassy\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nBy BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen in Tehran\n\nAs he declared the embassy open, Britain's foreign secretary Philip Hammond said there were no limits to what Britain and Iran might achieve together over time, though they wouldn't always agree.\n\nA small group of Iranians who work at the embassy watched as the Union flag was hoisted in the 14 and a half acre embassy compound for the first time since 2011.\n\nBehind the high walls there are gracious lawns and dappled pools of shade from mature trees. It's all a remarkable contrast with the traffic and noise outside, in a scruffy part of inner city Tehran.\n\nBut for many Iranians, the compound with the lion and unicorn on the pillars of the gate is also a symbol of Britain's past meddling in their country. As a precaution, riot police were lined up outside the gate.\n\nInside the embassy, graffiti left by radicals who invaded it in 2011 is still on doors and panelling. Above a portrait of the Queen is the message 'Death to England'.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nMore on this story",

I) at Aqueduct April 5.\nOrder This Photo\n\nConnections of Spring At Last, a convincing winner of the Feb. 2 Donn Handicap (gr. I), have decided to bypass the $6-million Dubai World Cup (UAE-I) March 29 and aim instead for the $300,000 Carter Handicap (gr. I) at Aqueduct April 5.\n\nTrainer Doug O\u2019Neill confirmed the decision March 6, saying the main consideration was to give Spring At Last a little more time between races.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very honored by the invitation to the Dubai World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the timing \u2014 we think it\u2019s a little too much at this point.\u201d\n\nSpring At Last has never won at the Dubai World Cup distance of 2,000 meters (about 1 \u00bc miles), but O\u2019Neill did not cite as factors the distance or the fact 2007 Horse of the Year Curlin already is waiting in Dubai with a victory at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse under his girth.\n\nHowever, he did note that Spring At Last underwent surgery for a bone chip in an ankle last year that sidelined the 5-year-old son of Silver Deputyfor about nine months following his impressive win in the Godolphin Mile (UAE-II) at Nad Al Sheba.\n\n\u201cWe just thought after winning the grade I race in Florida that we would focus on giving him plenty of time afterward,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cMaybe if the Dubai race was in another month or so, it would be a lot more tempting. Right now, it would just be too much to ask.\u201d\n\nSpring At Last worked a half-mile at Hollywood Park in :50.20 the last week of February, at which time O\u2019Neill said the Dubai World Cup was still the next objective for the earner of $1,137,650. Nothing has gone awry since then, he said;\u00a0 the horse is \u201cdoing fantastic.\u201d\n\nBred in Kentucky by WinStar Farm, Spring At Last races for the farm in partnership with J. Paul Reddam. WinStar will be represented in the Dubai World Cup by homebred San Antonio Handicap (gr. II) winner Well Armed, a son of Tiznow\u00a0\u00a0who is trained by Eoin Harty.\n\nReddam and O\u2019Neill could have another opportunity to compete in Dubai this year with grade II winner Notional. O\u2019Neill said they are hoping to receive an invitation to race in the $5-million Dubai Duty Free (UAE-I), a 1,777-meter event on the turf.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic colt \u2014 we\u2019re just so excited about him. We\u2019d love to try him on the turf over there,\u201d he said of the 4-year-old son of In Excess. \u201cHe\u2019s doing well, came out of his prep in great shape, and is ready to go if we get the invitation.\u201d\n\nNotional finished third by a neck in the 6 1\/2-furlong Daytona Handicap on the Santa Anita Park grass Feb. 17. Last year, he was a strong classic candidate, winning the San Rafael (gr. II) and Risen Star (gr. III) Stakes before finishing second to Scat Daddy in the Florida Derby (gr. I).\n\nA fracture of his left front cannon bone kept him away from the races for almost 11 months, with the Daytona marking his return to competition.\n\n\nMost Popular Stories",

        "text":"\n\nLooking back at the 2007 Ravens draft class\n\nThe Ravens are the only team to have made the playoffs in each of the past four seasons. That\u2019s a credit to G.M. Ozzie Newsome, who has given coach John Harbaugh enough talent to mold this team into a contender.\n\nAs we close in on the 2012 NFL draft, we\u2019ll take a look at how the Ravens have fared in recent drafts. It\u2019s too soon to give a fair evaluation from the 2010 and 2011 classes, but three years of NFL service time is enough for us to grade their 2007, 2008 and 2009 classes. In today\u2019s blog post, we will break down the 2007 class.\n\nTotal picks: seven (No. 29 overall, 74, 86, 134, 137, 174, and 207).\n\n2011 starters: left guard Ben Grubbs, right guard Marshal Yanda.\n\nPlayers still with the team: one (Yanda).\n\nBest pick: Yanda. The Ravens picked a pair of Pro Bowl guards in Grubbs and Yanda, but Yanda gets the nod because he was a third-rounder (Grubbs was the top pick) and because he brings nastiness and physicality to the Baltimore offensive line.\n\nBiggest miss: Yamon Figurs. With the first of their two third-round picks, they drafted Figurs, a speedy wide receiver and returner out of Kansas State. He scored two return touchdowns in his rookie year, but made just two catches for 79 yards in two seasons here.\n\nTrades: They dealt their second-round pick, No. 61, to the Detroit Lions for picks No. 74 (Figurs) and No. 101. They then traded No. 101, a fifth-round pick and a sixth-round pick to the Jacksonville Jaguars for No. 86 (Yanda).\n\nPlayers they could have had: Wide receivers Laurent Robinson, Jason Hill and Mike Sims-Walker were selected within the five picks after the Ravens took Figurs. Linebackers Zac Diles and Brandon Siler, running back Ahmad Bradshaw, and quarterback Tyler Thigpen were drafted after their final pick (Prescott Burgess).\n\nFinal grade: B. The Ravens selected a trio of Pro Bowl players in Grubbs, Yanda, and fullback Le\u2019Ron McClain, but only one player from the draft is still here five years later (though the Ravens did try hard to retain Grubbs this offseason before he joined the New Orleans Saints). Linebacker Antwan Barnes has found success in San Diego and quarterback Troy Smith, who was pushed to the side when the team drafted Joe Flacco, is now in Pittsburgh. Burgess has had about 500 different stints with the Ravens.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018, Sun Sentinel",

Unusually, the canoeists were paddling in Mediterranean salt sea water.\n\nSpecial thanks must go to the Italian security who, following the events in Nice, France, guarded competitors and their friends and relatives throughout.\n\nHighlight for the GB supporters was the fantastic skill of the U21 GB men who did not lose a single game and won the gold medal to become 2016 world champions.\n\nTheir speed of paddling and accuracy in passing and shooting was a delight to watch.\n\nGB beat the usually dominant Germans 5-4 in an exciting final \u2013 the first time the Germans have lost for some time \u2013 having previously defeated Italy 4-3 in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe GB U21 women, who had trained hard and improved considerably during 2016, won through to the semi-finals before eventually finishing fourth after losing 6-2 to New Zealand in the last four.\n\nThis was a good end to a hard season of training and competition for the GB U21 women. It was a satisfying competition for them and their coaches, which included canoeist and canoe designer Peter Howard from Compton Verney.\n\nThe senior GB women attained their target position of top six in the championships.\n\nThey narrowly missed out on the semi-finals as they were beaten in the quarter-finals, before losing 4-1 to Italy in the 5th\/6th place play-off.\n\nThe team included Stratford siblings Danielle Brain, 19, and Nicole Brain, 23, who is swim manager at Stratford Leisure Centre. The senior women\u2019s coach is Stratford\u2019s 1992 C2 canoe slalom Olympian Paul Brain.\n\nThe senior GB men\u2019s team had mixed results throughout the championships as they exceeded expectations.\n\nThey managed a good seventh position out of 24 teams after beating Denmark 7-3 in the 7th\/8th place play-off.\n\nThe senior men\u2019s team included Leamington-based Matt Blackmore and Martyn Pearson.\n\nAlso coaching at the championships was Paul\u2019s 1992 Olympic C2 partner, Stratford\u2019s Chris Arrowsmith, who was coaching the senior Canadian women\u2019s team.\n\nThe Canadian women met GB in the group play-offs for fifth to eighth places and GB, who eventually finished sixth, won 8-4. The Canadian women ended the championships in eighth place.",

She worked from 1976 to 1984 as a bankruptcy court law clerk, a bankruptcy trustee, and an attorney in private practice specializing in bankruptcy.\n\nJudge Perris has held other positions as past board member, Federal Judicial Center (FJC); past chair, FJC Bankruptcy Judges\u2019 Education Committee, and the Bankruptcy Section of the Federal Bar Association.\n\nShe also is hearing the Stockton bankruptcy case.\n\nThe sheer number of requests said Assistant Town Manager Marianna Marysheva-Martinez slowed the town business significantly.\n\n\u201cIt has been an enormous amount of work for the people in the town,\u201d she said at a Town Council meeting Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind we have only 17 employees. We have inquiries through walk-in, via-phone, via-email\u2014numerous inquiries on a daily basis, and it does create quite a distraction and takes away from what they need to do.\u201d\n\nAfter the mediation sessions on Monday and Tuesday, the next important date is Aug. 29, she said, for a \u201cstatus conference\u201d in which a judge in Sacramento will review objections to Mammoth\u2019s bid for bankruptcy protection. Those objections must be filed by Friday, Aug. 24.\n\nAt the Aug. 29 status conference, a judge then will set a date for a full-blown hearing to determine if Mammoth is eligible to declare bankruptcy.\n\nShould events reach that far, the town then would present its financial plan to a court and ask that it be approved.\n\n\u201cThose requests are a lot of work by staff,\u201d Marysheva-Martinez told the council. \u201cWe literally have to go back through emails and hard-copy files, in some cases going back to 2008 and 2009.\n\n\u201cWe are working extremely hard to meet those deadlines, so that\u2019s what is happening behind the scenes.\u201d",

Photo by Don Mann.\nKelsia Orrin\nKelsea Orrin. Photo by Don Mann.\n\n\nLast year the Woodinville volleyball team placed fourth at the Class 4A state tournament \u2014 its best finish in school history by far\u2014 and the Lady Falcons are back to take another run at it.\n\nBut first things first for fourth-year coach Mike Mills, as last year is just a fond memory.\n\n\"Right now we\u2019re still figuring out who our setter\u2019s going to be,\" he said of the critical position that sets the offense in motion. \"We have three players battling for that spot right now and we\u2019ll learn more after we play a couple preseason games.\"\n\nMills, however, has the luxury of one sure thing: Ali Forde is back for her senior year, good for the coach and a big problem for the rest of the KingCo conference.\n\nThe 6 foot, 2 inch wrecking ball was first team all-state last season \u2014 the only junior between the Puget Sound and the Idaho border to earn the honor \u2014 and according to Mills has gotten better.\n\n\"She can hit outside, hit middle, she can pass and serve and plays great defense up front and in the back,\" he said. \"She\u2019s an all-around player without a doubt, and she\u2019ll be on the court a lot. We have high expectations for her and she has high goals for herself.\"\n\nAlways a leader by example, Forde now steps into a more vocal leadership role with the void left by the graduation of Melissa Gilkey and Carmen Vasilatos, a role she can handle, Mills said.\n\n\"Oh yeah, what\u2019s driving her right now is she just wants the team to succeed. She had a lot of fun last year ending state on a high note, not just being a great player but having her team play along at that great level, too.\"\n\nSeniors Ashtyn Mann, Kelsea Orren and Jen Schnelle all dipped their toes in the state tournament waters and are slated for the starting lineup.\n\n\"Ashtyn\u2019s 6-2, will play in the middle, strong, great vertical, getting her angles down,\" Mills said. \"Kelsea is vying for the setter position, played a lot of backcourt for us last year but can play anywhere. And we moved Jen to libero this year. She was a setter but now it\u2019ll be a full time defensive gig for her. She played a lot of defense at state and we\u2019re real excited about what she\u2019s turned into as a senior.\"\n\nSenior Andie Kelly and juniors Hailey Chapman and Maddy Young appear to have the inside track to be the other starters, Mills said, though nothing was set in stone before even the jamboree was played.\n\nKelly\u2019s a competitive 6-footer who\u2019s made great strides, Chapman is a high-jumping outside hitter who can set, too, and Young, Mills said, \"might surprise some people this year.\" Also in the mix at setter is junior Brooke Wiley, who played a bit at state as a sophomore serving specialist and gained some big-game experience.\n\nWhat does Mills like best about this group?\n\n\"The neat thing is they really get along well together,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a natural chemistry that clicks. Things have been very smooth so far which is cool, and never a given with teenagers.\"\n\nThe Lady Falcons jump right into the frying pan, traveling to traditional powerhouses Edmonds-Woodway and Graham-Kapowsin this week and then participating in the Adidas Tournament at Auburn-Mountainview to face quality opponents before KingCo play begins.\n\nThe big question right now is who will establish herself at setter, and this time next week Mills will have a much better idea of who can put the ball in the window consistently. So far, he likes what he sees on defense.\n\n\"I feel we\u2019re ahead defensively right now of where we were (the sametime) last year \u2014 which was a pretty good team but we struggled a bit early.\n\n\"We just need to play some other teams. There\u2019s only so much you can learn playing against yourself.\"\n\nShare this post\n\nSubmit to FacebookSubmit to Google PlusSubmit to Twitter",

        "text":"MSU Drops OT Heartbreaker in GLI Final\nPalmisano made 45 saves for the second straight game\n\nDec. 30, 2011\n\nHighlights Notes\n\nDetroit, Mich. - Drew Palmisano made 45 saves for the second straight night, but Kevin Clare's game winner 11:44 into the extra period gave Michigan a 3-2 overtime victory over the Spartans in the finals of the 47th annual Great Lakes Invitational on Friday evening in Detroit.\n\nTanner Sorenson and Brett Perlini had the Spartan markers, but an ill-timed penalty late in the game gave Michigan the game-tying goal with less than a minute to go in regulation, and Clare's heroics gave Michigan their 15th Great Lakes Invitational title and second straight.\n\n\"I was proud of our team,\" said head coach Tom Anastos. \"I really wanted this win for our seniors. It's disappointing, but it really was a very good hockey game tonight. Palmy was outstanding in both games. What you want out of your goaltender is for him to give you a chance to win - and Palmisano did that for us this weekend.\"\n\nClare's game-winner came after both teams had their chances in the first half of the extra frame. Lee Moffie got around the Spartan defender as he carried it up the left side. He sent a cross-slot pass that made its way through traffic to Clare, at the right post, who had an open net to work with as Palmisano was screened at the left post.\n\nPalmisano made 45 saves in the OT loss, his second straight night with 45 saves, one shy of his career best of 46. His 90 saves in this year's tournament broke the record for saves in the two-game tournament. Geoff McMullen of Colgate had 89 saves in the 1970 tournament for Colgate, which beast Brown (4-3 ) in the consolation game after losing to eventual tournament champion Michigan Tech 11-6 in the first game.\n\n\n\nThe opening score in the game didn't come until the latter half of the second period. Freshman Tanner Sorenson carried the puck up the right side, and let loose a wrister from the top of the right circle that beat Hunwick over his glove-hand shoulder. It was the first goal of the freshman's career, with assists going to Torey Krug and Daultan Leveille.\n\nMichigan tiedthe game at the midpoint of the third period. The Wolverines had a power play at 7:38, but spent much of the second minute of their man advantage trying to get the puck back into the offensive zone. As the penalty expired, Palmisano came up with a big pad save on Phil DiGiuseppe at the left post. The Spartans could not get the puck out of the zone, and had pressure deep . Palmisano sprawled to his left to make a save as Derek DeBlois came across the goalmouth left-to-right, and the sophomore was able to flip the puck over the prone netminder at 10:11.\n\nThe Spartans got the goal back at 12:32. Kevin Walrod made a nifty spin-o-rama move just above the left circle, and dished it off to Brett Perlini. Perlini's snipe from the left dot ricocheted off the top of Hunwick's right leg pad and into the back of the net for the go-ahead marker.\n\nThe Wolverines got a lift at 17:42 of the final frame, when Brent Darnell was sent to the box for tripping. Hunwick came off in favor of an extra skater, giving Michigan a six-on-four. Blueliner Mac Bennett put puck into the corner, and Luke Moffatt fired it out of the corner and into the slot. Kevin Lynch was there there to get a stick on it, and he deflected it into the net to knot the score at two with just 50 seconds remaining in regulation.\n\nMichigan put 24 shots on net in the final frame, a season high allowed in any period by the Spartans. UM outshot MSU 6-4 in the extra period.\n\nPalmisano, Perlini, and Torey Krug were named to the All-Tournament Team.\n\nThe Spartans, now 11-7-2 on the year, will return to conference play next weekend when they host Miami at Munn Ice Arena.",

Obama said the administration will stop deporting undocumented immigrants who had come to the U.S. when they were at a young age.\n\n    Immigration experts encouraged undocumented San Francisco youth on Wednesday to prepare for next week when they will be able to apply for deferred deportation.\n\n    The policy change, announced by President Obama in June, provides a two-year deferral of deportation for people who came to the U.S. before the age of 16, are under 31 years old, and meet other requirements.\n\n    The first day to apply for the policy is Aug. 15, and members of the San Francisco Immigrant Legal and Education Network (SFILEN), the coalition that held Wednesday's news conference, encouraged people to prepare \u00a0ahead of time.\n\n    \"Start obtaining documentation, school records, medical records, anything with a name and dates,\" said Laura Sanchez, an immigration attorney with the Central American Resource Center (CARECEN), a group in the \u00a0coalition.\n\n    Other eligibility requirements include having resided continuously in the U.S. since June 15, 2007, currently being in school or having obtained a high school diploma, and having not been convicted of a felony offense or a \u00a0significant misdemeanor.\n\n    Sanchez said another critical thing to be aware of for immigrants seeking deferred deportation is the $465 application fee.\n\n    \"It's a significant amount of money,\" she said. \"Imagine having multiple family members who may qualify.\"\n\n    Anoop Prasad, an immigration attorney with the Asian Law Caucus, \u00a0said many people are wary of applying because they believe it could put their \u00a0undocumented family members who are not eligible for the program at risk. \u00a0Prasad said that is not the case.\n\n    \"Privacy act privileges are in place,\" Prasad said.\n\n    He said some are also waiting until after the November \u00a0presidential election to apply since a new president could alter or dismantle \u00a0the policy.\n\n    Sanchez said people interested in applying should consult with a \u00a0nonprofit agency that is part of SFILEN or an experienced immigration \u00a0attorney because \"it's somewhat of a complicated process,\" and said an \u00a0application form has still yet to be released by federal officials.\n\n    She also warned against \"notarios,\" people posing as immigration \u00a0attorneys or consultants.\n\n    Emmanuel Valenciano, a 24-year-old San Francisco State University \u00a0student, said he is an example of an undocumented immigrant who plans on \u00a0applying for the policy.\n\n    Valenciano said he was moved to the U.S. from the Philippines at \u00a0the age of 13.\"At that time, I did not know the consequences of staying here,\" \u00a0he said. \"I was afraid of the future, and didn't know if my status would be \u00a0fixed.\"\n\n    Valenciano said \"it was amazing\" when he heard of the new policy, \u00a0but said \"it's only a temporary\" fix for undocumented youth.\n\n    \"There are hard workers still living in the shadows,\" he said.\n\n    For more information on the deferred action process, visit the \u00a0U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website at",

        "text":"Staying true to net neutrality\n\nWill the FCC create a two-tiered Internet in which deep-pocketed companies get special treatment?\n\nChairman Tom Wheeler of the Federal Communications Commission said all the right things about net neutrality Thursday as the agency voted to release draft rules for preserving the open Internet. Nevertheless, real questions remain about whether the proposal he's championed is the right way to protect the Internet's reach, connectivity and innovative spirit. Perhaps that's why the commission provided an unusually long time for the public to comment on Wheeler's proposal and possible alternatives. It's a reminder that, despite the near-hysteria drummed up by some net neutrality advocates, we're still at the start of the rule-making process, not the end.\n\nAt issue is whether and how the government should try to stop certain Internet service providers \u2014 companies such as AT&T, Verizon and Time-Warner Cable that connect individual users to the Net \u2014 from favoring some sites and services over others. The fear is that ISPs would sell high-priority delivery to deep-pocketed companies, enabling their content to look and perform better at the expense of everyone else's. Although the FCC has been saying for a decade that broadband access service should be free from such interference, the courts have twice rejected its rules and enforcement efforts. There are no neutrality rules in force today, just antitrust and consumer protection laws to deter ISPs from tilting the online playing field.\n\nWheeler has proposed taking a case-by-case approach that would forbid ISPs from striking \"commercially unreasonable\" deals with sites and services that want to pay for premium access to Internet users. Critics on the left say his approach would lead to a \"two-tiered\" Internet with fast lanes for big companies and slow lanes for start-ups and innovators, while those on the right say it's a solution in search of a problem. The proposal is moving ahead in part because of language Wheeler added to clarify the sorts of deals ISPs would be barred from making, providing more assurance that consumers and content providers wouldn't face slowdowns, and giving more weight to a stringent regulatory alternative favored by many neutrality advocates.\n\nBefore Thursday's vote, Wheeler emphatically declared his opposition to a two-tiered Internet. \"There is one Internet. It must be fast, it must be robust, and it must be open,\" he said, adding, \"The prospect of a gatekeeper choosing winners and losers on the Internet is unacceptable.\" He's right about all that, yet good intentions don't count for much. The commission needs to show that whatever rules it adopts will actually promote innovation and investment, set clear guidelines for ISPs that won't shift with the political winds, and have a solid basis in law. Wheeler's statements raise the hope that the new rules will meet those tests. But the scrutiny is just starting.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018, Hartford Courant",

        "text":"Israel mobilizes ground forces for an incursion into Gaza, after rockets fired at Jerusalem\n\nSaturday, November 17, 2012\nBy Paul Martin\n\nNovember 17, 2012\n\nTEL AVIV\u2014Israel\u2019s military stepped up its mobilizations for a possible ground invasion of the Gaza Strip on Friday after Palestinian rockets struck near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as neighboring Egypt escalated its own war of words against Israel. Late Friday, Israel\u2019s cabinet approved the call-up of 75,000 Israeli reservists, more than doubling the number authorized the previous day. Heavy armor and soldiers from two elite brigades continued to mass at staging grounds on the Gaza border. A decision to launch a ground invasion could come within 24 to 36 hours if rocket fire continues, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon told CNN on Friday \u201cThey don\u2019t call up all these reserves to keep people standing in the stands watching,\u201d said a senior Israeli military official. \u201cAfter rockets on Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, it\u2019s pretty hard not to\u201d order a ground invasion. For three hours on Friday, Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil visited the Gaza Strip and stood hand-in-hand with leaders of Hamas, the militant and political group that rules Gaza. Coming after two days of Israeli strikes there, it was a bold show of support for Hamas from Cairo as well as a diplomatic gambit to gain a break in the fighting. Israel had pledged to hold its fire during Mr. Qandil\u2019s visit. But rockets from the Palestinian territory could be heard taking off toward Israel, even as the Egyptian premier spoke to reporters. The emerging question in the latest conflict\u2014which was sparked by a rise in Gazan rocket attacks on Israel earlier this month, and broke into the open when Israel assassinated Hamas\u2019s top military commander on Wednesday\u2014is how far Egypt\u2019s new Islamist government can extend itself on the behalf of its ideological allies in Hamas. Egypt is a peace partner of Israel. Its gasping economy depends on Western largess and its military largely is funded by the U.S. In recent days, U.S. President Barack Obama has had several calls with Egypt\u2019s recently elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, aimed at bringing Hamas in line. During Friday\u2019s call, the White House said, President Obama commended Egypt\u2019s efforts to de-escalate the situation. \u201cMorsi\u2019s room to maneuver is very limited,\u201d said Ofer Zalzberg, a Middle East analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cHe is dependent on the West. Everything he has done so far is pretty standard, not very different than what [former President Hosni] Mubarak would have done. Even sending the PM to Gaza, he declared that only after his conversation with Obama. So he\u2019s not out there acting unilaterally.\u201d If Israel\u2019s leaders give the order for a ground assault on Gaza, it would be the first such operations since 2009 and would plunge Israel\u2019s government into risky territory\u2014risking soldier casualties and steep political fallout should the operation go awry, and jeopardizing its international backing. Israel\u2019s three-week ground war against Hamas in 2009 left more than 1,000 Palestinians dead, and destroyed entire villages and much of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure. Israel\u2019s image tanked internationally as it fended off war-crimes accusations. Prime Minister Qandil arrived in Gaza on Friday morning to demonstrate his new government\u2019s clear policy break from Mr. Mubarak\u2019s more-pro-Israeli regime. In a visit unprecedented for such a senior Egyptian official, he met with Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh before visiting wounded civilians at a crowded Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. -WSJ\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nJoin the revolution in 2018.
