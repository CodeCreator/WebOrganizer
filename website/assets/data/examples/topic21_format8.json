        "text":"Travel Center\n\nHelpful resources from the NCAA\n\n\n\nOn behalf of the UNCG Athletics Department, we appreciate and encourage your support and interest. But please know that any inappropriate contacts or actions may jeopardize the eligibility of prospects and\/or student-athletes as well as lead to sanctions being imposed on a member institution.\n\n\nProspective Student-Athlete: A prospective student-athlete (\"prospect\") is defined as an individual who has begun classes for the ninth (9th) grade. However, it is possible for a student who is still in a lower grade to be considered as a prospect. Please ask first if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nStudent-Athlete: A student-athlete is a student who is enrolled at a four-year institution and whose enrollment was solicited by a member of the athletics staff or other representative of athletics interests with a view toward the student's participation in the intercollegiate athletics program.\n\nContact: A contact is any face-to-face encounter between a prospect, or the prospect's parent or legal guardian, and an institutional staff member or athletics representative during which any dialogue occurs.\n\nRecruiting: Recruiting is any solicitation (by phone, mail or in-person) of a prospect or a prospect's family member or legal guardian. Only those institutional coaches who have passed the NCAA Recruiting Test are permitted to recruit for the institution.\n\nRepresentatives of Athletics Interests: An individual, independent agency, corporate entity or any organization who is known (or who should have been known) by a member institution's executive or athletics administration to:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a) Have participated in or to be a member of an agency or organization promoting the institution's intercollegiate athletics program;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) Have made financial contributions to the athletic department or to an athletics booster organization of that institution;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) Be assisting or to have been requested (by the athletic department staff) to assist in the recruitment of prospects;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d) Be assisting or to have assisted in providing benefits to enrolled student-athletes or their families; or\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e) Have been involved otherwise in promoting the institution's athletics program.\n\nOnce an individual is identified as such a representative, the person retains that identity indefinitely.\n\nExtra Benefit: An extra benefit is any special arrangement by an institutional employee or an athletics representative to provide a prospect or a student-athlete (or the prospect or student-athlete's relatives or friends) with a benefit not expressly authorized by NCAA legislation. The following are examples of extra benefits:\n\n  \u2022 Giving cash or loans in any amount.\n  \u2022 Signing or co-signing a note with an outside agency to arrange a loan.\n  \u2022 Employing relatives or friends of a student-athlete.\n  \u2022 Giving gifts of any kind (e.g., birthday, Christmas, Valentine's Day) or free services (e.g., clothing, airline tickets, laundry, car repair, haircuts, meals in restaurants).\n  \u2022 Providing special discounts for goods or services.\n  \u2022 Providing use of an automobile.\n  \u2022 Providing a meal other than in your home on special infrequent occasions (e.g., Thanksgiving, birthday).\n  \u2022 Providing use of your summer home to go water skiing, hunting, etc.\n  \u2022 Providing transportation for any purpose.\n  \u2022 Providing rent-free or reduced-rent housing.\n  \u2022 Providing a benefit connected with on- or off-campus housing (e.g., television set, stereo equipment).\n  \u2022 Providing tickets to an athletic, institutional or community event.\n  \u2022 Providing a guarantee of a bond.\n  \u2022 Providing promise of financial aid for postgraduate education.\n  \u2022 Promising employment after college graduation.\n\n\nDO NOT become directly or indirectly involved in arranging for a prospect, or the prospect's relatives or friends, to receive money or financial aid of any kind.\n\nDO NOT provide any \"extra benefits\" to or for a prospect, or the prospect's relatives or friends, without first checking with the UNCG Athletics Compliance Office.\n\nDO NOT write to, telephone or contact in person a prospect or the prospect's family (on or off campus).\u00a0If a coach is accompanied by a prospect on campus, in the community or at the airport, do not approach the coach and prospect.\u00a0If a prospect approaches you at an off-campus location regarding an institution's athletic program, explain that NCAA rules do not permit you to discuss the program.\u00a0Suggest that the prospect contact the institution's athletics department for information.\n\nDO NOT entertain high school, prep school or two-year college coaches at any location.\n\nDO NOT contact the prospect's coach, principal or counselor for evaluating the prospect.\u00a0You are not permitted to videotape games or pick up films or transcripts from the prospect's educational institution.\n\n\nDO feel free to attend high school and community college athletic events for your enjoyment, but not to scout or videotape for an institution's coaching staff.\u00a0While at such an event, you cannot have any contact with prospects or their relatives.\u00a0Should you find yourself seated next to parents of a prospect, DO NOT initiate conversation with them.\u00a0If conversation is initiated with you, respond in a civil manner but DO NOT discuss anything regarding a member institution's athletic program.\u00a0Direct their questions to the coaching staff or the UNCG Athletics Compliance Office.\n\nDO continue ESTABLISHED family relationships with friends and neighbors.\u00a0You are permitted to engage in your normal activities with prospects and their parents who are family and\/or friends as long as they are not made for recruiting purposes and are not prompted by a member institutions coaching staff.\u00a0Again, you simply are not permitted to attempt to recruit the prospect or discuss the athletics program.\n\nDO feel free to attend a public event (e.g., a high school awards banquet or dinner) at which prospects attend.\u00a0NO attempt should be made to contact or recruit the prospect at these events.\n\nDO send the coaching staffs any newspaper clippings or other information about prospects which you think would be of interest.\u00a0Your assistance in this way is very helpful.\u00a0 The coaching staff will then make the contact with the prospect.\n\nDO provide employment opportunities for currently enrolled student-athletes as appropriate.\u00a0 Rules regarding employment may be found on this site.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPLEASE . . .\n\nDO NOT provide any of the extra benefits listed in the \"extra benefits\" section of this site.\n\nDO NOT expend funds to entertain prospects or student-athletes, their friends or relatives.\u00a0 You are not even permitted to buy a soda or a cup of coffee for them.\n\nDO NOT provide awards or gifts to a prospect or student-athlete for his or her athletic performance.\u00a0All awards must conform to NCAA regulations and must be approved by the institution.\n\nDO NOT allow a prospect or student-athlete, or his or her friends or relatives to use your telephone or a telephone card to make free long distance calls.\n\nDO NOT provide an honorarium to a prospect or student-athlete for a speaking engagement.\n\nDO NOT use the name or picture of an enrolled student-athlete to directly advertise, recommend or promote sales or use of a commercial product or service of any kind.\u00a0Even the sale of a picture of an enrolled student-athlete would jeopardize their eligibility.\n\nDO NOT provide room, board or transportation to friends or family of an enrolled student-athlete to enable them to visit campus or attend an away athletics contest.\n\nDO NOT provide room, board or transportation\u00a0to an enrolled student-athlete for collegiate competition.\n\n\nCriteria Governing Compensation to Student-Athletes - Compensation may be paid to a student-athlete:\n\n(a) Only for work actually performed; and\n\n(b) At a rate commensurate with the going rate in that locality for similar services.\n\nSuch compensation may not include any remuneration for value or utility that the student-athlete may have for the employer because of the publicity, reputation, fame or personal following that he or she has obtained because of athletics ability.\n\nThe following rules are applicable to any type of student-athlete employment, whether during the academic year or summer:\n\n  \u2022 The rate of pay must be the normal rate for the duties performed.\n  \u2022 The hours paid must be the hours worked.\n  \u2022 Payment in advance of hours worked is not permitted.\n  \u2022 Transportation to work may be provided only if transportation is available to other non-athlete employees in similar positions.\n\nFee-for-Lesson Instruction\nA student-athlete may receive compensation for teaching or coaching sport skills or techniques in his or her sport on a fee-for-lesson basis, provided:\n\n(a) Institutional facilities are not used;\n\n(b) Playing lessons shall not be permitted;\n\n(c) The institution obtains and keeps on file documentation of the recipient of the lesson(s) and the fee for the lesson(s) provided during any time of the year; and\n\n(d) The compensation is paid by the lesson recipient (or the recipient's family) and not another individual or entity.\n\n(e) Instruction to each individual is comparable to the instruction that would be provided during a private lesson when the instruction involves more than one individual at a time.\u00a0\n\n(f) The student-athlete does not use his or her name, picture or appearance to promote or advertise the availability of fee-for-lesson sessions.\u00a0\n\n\nAll charitable, educational and nonprofit promotional activities involving student-athletes must have prior approval from the UNCG Athletic Department.\u00a0Student-athletes are not permitted to be involved in the advertisement, endorsement or promotion of a commercial product or service of any kind.\n\n\nPermissible recruiters: Only authorized institutional staff members shall be allowed to recruit a prospect or the prospect's relatives or legal guardian(s).\u00a0Boosters are not considered to be part of the institution's staff.\n\nASK BEFORE YOU ACT!\u00a0 P...

The results of any matches so arranged, with details of the individual matches, should be sent to the Honorary Secretary. Only in exceptional circumstances may an officer who is not a Member of the Society be permitted to play in a match in order to make up a side. Members are requested to wear the colours of the Society when playing in such matches.\n\n\n1. Meetings will be held annually at which Members shall compete for the following trophies:-\n\na. Summer Meeting\n\nIndividual Trophies\n\n(i) Black Watch Challenge Medal.\n\n(ii) Grenadier Guards Challenge Cup\n\n(iii) Royal Indian Army Service Corps Cup\n\n(iv) Andrew Turnbull Salver\n\n(v) Veterans Cup.\n\n(vi) British Troops Austria Prize.\n\n(vii) Cavan National Playing Fields Cup.\n\n(viii) Super Veterans Prize\n\nTeam Trophies\n\n(ix) Argyll and Sutherland Bowl\n\n(x) Ordnance Cup\n\n(xi) Royal Engineers Sunningdale Cup\n\n(xii) Egypt Cup\n\nNote:- Individual trophies\/prizes (i) to (vii) will be awarded in the order as listed above. No member may win more than one individual trophy and its associated prize except the winner of competition (i) above, who may win one other additional trophy\/prize.\n\nb. Autumn Meeting\n\nIndividual and Team Trophies \u2013 The Generals Cup, the Society Autumn Medal, and the Jubilee Regimental Foursomes.\n\n\nThe committee cannot allot handicaps. Members will be asked to give their Club Handicaps when entering Society Competitions. However the Committee is empowered to alter any handicap it considers necessary during Society Meetings.\n\n\nMembers and Regimental\/Corps Golf Societies, who win trophies at Society Meetings, are responsible for their safe custody, whilst in their possession. They should also arrange for engraving as required, and ensure their safe return to the Honorary Secretary prior to the presentation at the next Meeting.\n\nN.B. The Society\u2019s Insurers cover all Trophies.\n\n\n1. Any proposition which involves any radical alteration in the constitution or rules of the Society, or in the conditions under which:-\n\n  \u2022 The Black Watch Medals;\n  \u2022 The Argyll and Sutherland Challenge Bowl;\n  \u2022 The Ordnance Challenge Cup, the Royal Engineers Sunningdale Cup or the Egypt Cups,\n\nare at present played, shall require the concurrence of at least two-thirds of the members present at a General Meeting, at which meeting, a minimum of 40 Members must be present and voting.\n\n2. Any such proposition, should it be carried, will be adopted forthwith and will be confirmed or negated at the next General Meeting, at which the same voting rules as stated in para 1. above, will apply.\n\n3. No such proposition shall be entertained at a General Meeting unless the terms thereof have been intimated in writing to the Hon Secretary at least two days prior to the General Meeting.\n\n\n\nThe Black Watch Challenge Medal was presented to the Society in Memory of Lt F G Tait BW, a former Amateur Champion, who was killed during the Boer War. It is the premier individual trophy to be played for by Members of the Society at its Summer Meeting.\n\n\nThe Medal is competed for over two rounds and the winner of the Gold Medal will be the player with the lowest scratch score. The runner up will receive the Silver Medal. It is now the norm for the competition to be played over two days and in the event of a tie the Medal will be awarded to the player with the better score on the second day. Ties will be resolved in accordance with the Rules of Golf as periodically issued by The R&A.\n\n\n\nThe rules have been amended significantly over successive AGMs in 2010 and 2011 in order to cope with the reducing number of entries in the Ordnance, Sunningdale and Egypt Cups. These amendments build on the 2001 revision which was made to reflect the unfortunate but inevitable weakening of the linkage between team members and the strength and size of parent Regiments and Corps. Allocation into Cup competitions is now based on the number of teams entered and on the standard of those who can attend the meeting. Arrangements for the A&S Bowl will also allow different formats of competition depending on the number of teams actually attending. The aim remains to have \u201cserious fun\u201d and as much golf as possible over equitable scratch matches.\n\n\n1. Entries.\n\nTeam Entry Form \u2018A\u2019 will be produced and circulated by the Hon Secretary, to all Regimental\/Corps Golf Societies in early January\/February. This entry form requires only the number of teams a Regiment\/Corps Golf Society intends to enter. The entry should be returned to the Hon. Secretary, accompanied by the Entry Fee for each team, before the date indicated on the form.\n\n2. The Argyll and Sutherland Challenge Bowl.\n\nThe Argyll and Sutherland Challenge Bowl is open to teams from all British Infantry and Royal Armoured Corps Regiments irrespective of size, and to the Infantry element of the Brigade of Gurkhas.\n\na. The format of play will be dependent upon the number of entries as follows:\n\ni) 3 or 4 entries, then teams will play a Round Robin format (each Team play all other teams once).\n\nii) 5 or more entries, then teams will play under the Conditions and Rules as laid down.\n\nb. A random draw to decide the Order of Play will be produced and distributed to competing Regiments by the Honorary Secretary.\n\n3. The Ordnance Challenge Cup, the Royal Engineers Sunningdale Cup and the Egypt Cup.\n\na. These three Competitions are open to teams that are NOT eligible to enter the Argyll & Sutherland Challenge Bowl, (i.e. all non-Infantry, non-RAC Regiments and Corps and the infantry element of the Brigade of Gurkhas of the British Army). They are also open to the Golfing Societies of those Regiments\/Corps that have been disbanded and\/or amalgamated into larger Corps.\n\nb. i) The composition of the three Competitions will be dependent upon the aggregate handicaps of the teams submitted by the Captain\/Secretary of Regimental\/Corps Golfing Societies.\n\nii) At the Summer Meeting, Team entries that had previously been submitted to the Honorary Secretary, will be divided equally into the three Competitions according to their aggregate handicaps. Where the total entries do not give an equal number for each Competition then the extra team\/s will be entered into the Egypt and Sunningdale Cups respectively.\n\nc. i) The Captain\/Secretary of all competing Golfing Societies should submit to the Committee or Hon. Secretary, before 1700 hrs on the Wednesday of the Summer Meeting, the list\/s of their selected team\/s (with handicaps), showing the aggregate handicap of each team.\n\nii) The Committee will place Teams into Cup Competitions, based on their aggregate handicaps.\n\nd. Order of Play will be decided by a draw, which will take place immediately after the AGM.\n\ne. The format of play will be dependent upon the number of entries as follows:\n\ni) If there are only sufficient for 3 or 4 entries in the competitions, then teams will play a Round Robin format (each Team plays all other teams once).\n\nii) If there are sufficient for 5 or more entries in the competitions, then teams will play under the Conditions and Rules as laid down..\n\niii) If there are not sufficient teams for three competit...

Coaches in coaches boxes DO NOT need to wear a helmet.\n\n\n2. Teams are allowed to use a DH according to American League rules.\n\n\n3. Teams are allowed to use an EH.\u00a0 This EH is considered\u00a0 an extra position player and should be treated the same as any other position on the field except for the pitcher.\u00a0 Any substitution of the EH should be applied to Major League Baseball Rules.\n\nPlayer Requirements\n\nIn order to play in the Green Mountain Baseball League, ALL players are required to....\n\n1.

NO EXCEPTIONS.\u00a0 Opposing Coaches can NO longer \"approve\" players with less than six games.\n\n\nGame Schedule Requirements\n\nThis policy shall be used to determined the number of REQUIRED games played for the 2017 season....\n\n1. The 2017 schedule shall include 22 regular season games (11 Sunday Doubleheaders in 14 Sundays)\n\n2.\u00a0 ALL games are to be initially scheduled as Doubleheaders on Sundays starting at 11AM.\n\n3. ALL teams will be required to play 20 regular season games, UNLESS....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a. ALL games on that GMBL scheduled Sunday rainout.\u00a0 In this case, one (1) required game will be subtracted from the total of required games played from ALL teams in the GMBL.\u00a0 EXAMPLE:\u00a0Two (2) scheduled\u00a0Sundays rainout for the Brewers and four (4) Sundays rainout for the Mariners.\u00a0Overall, four (4)\u00a0Sundays total rainout for the GMBL.\u00a0 The Brewers, Mariners\u00a0AND every other team in the GMBL are required to play 20 minus 4 equals 16 games required.\u00a0 That means the Mariners would have played 14 games (22-4X2)=14.\u00a0 The Mariners would be required to makeup a minimum of two (2) games.\u00a0 The Brewers would have played 18 games (22-2X2)=18.\u00a0 Therefore the Brewers would NOT have to makeup any games, however they will make every effort to play as close to 22 games as possible.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0bb.

ALL teams will try their best to play as close to 22 games as possible, weather permitting.\n\n\nIn 2019, ALL teams will make the playoffs as long as they meet the minimum requirements below....\n\n-Team has played the minimum required amount of games.\u00a0 (See schedule rules)\n\n-Team must start playoff games with a minimum of 9 players.\n\n-Each of the 9 players must have played in a minimum of 6 LEAGUE games.\n\n\n\n-Teams shall play in a \"Best of 3 series\" with 2 games played on a Saturday. And the decisive \"if necessary\" game 3 will be played the next day. (weather dependent....Rain shall push the Saturday games to Sunday).\n\n-ALL 3 games shall be played at the Higher Seeded team's Home field.\n\n-Regular season game rules apply.\n\n-Quarterfinals (First weekend in August)= 5th Place @ 4th Place\n\n-Semifinals\u00a0 (Second Weekend in August)=Winner of Quarterfinals @ 1st Place....3rd Place @ 2nd Place.\n\n-Finals (Third Weekend in August)= Semifinal winners (Higher Seed hosts)\n\n-Umpires are split by both teams in the quarters and semis.\u00a0 The Finals will be paid for by the league.\n\n\nDeposit Summary\n\nYour $200 deposit covers the following.....\n\n1. $150= Forfeit Procedures.\u00a0 Please follow the \"Forfeit Procedures\" rules below for more information.\n\n2. $50= Online Statistics.\u00a0 Although perfection is not required.\u00a0 All stats should be entered onto the GMBL website.\u00a0 This encourages other teams\/players to play, helps with League Leaders and helps each other prevent \"ringers\" from joining the playoffs.\n\nForfeit Procedures\n\nA Forfeit win or a Forfeit loss can only be awarded in the following cases.\u00a0 The implementation of this policy must be approved by the League President....\n\n1.

A FULL $150 deposit will be taken from the HOME team.\u00a0 Game 2 may be rescheduled at a later date.\n\n5. Teams must have a minimum of 9 players to start the game.\u00a0 Anything less is considered a Forfeit. One (1) win will be awarded to the opposing team and one (1) Forfeit loss awarded to the forfeiting team. A $150 DEPOSIT WILL BE TAKEN IN THIS CASE.\n\nPlayoff Forfeits....\n\n1. In case of a Playoff Forfeit, the opposing team will be declared the winner.\u00a0 NO DEPOSITS WILL BE TAKEN.\u00a0 Their penalty is that their season is over.\n\nPotential Rainout Procedures\n\nThese guidelines should be used to prevent miscommunication and unwarranted travel for potential rainout games...\n\n1. In case of inclement weather, both coaches shall make the decision \"to play or not to play\" based on the days forecast by 8AM (Weekend games)\n\n2. In case of inclement weather, the HOME team shall check on the HOME FIELD for that day and make the sole decision \"to play or not to play\" based on condition of the field by 9AM.\n\n3. If the decision is \"to play\" on items 1 and 2 above, the expectation is that the game(s) will be started at some point that day.\u00a0 Delayed starts are allowed, but prior notification by the HOME team to the AWAY team is common courtesy.\n\n4.\u00a0All games that are started but POSTPONED later in the day, will be continued at a later, agreed upon later date with the game continuing where it left off.\n\n5. All games that have played a complete 5 innings (4 1\/2 if the home team is leading) will be considered a COMPLETED game.\n\n6. Makeups can be made up at any place at any time within the start date (4\/30) and the end date of season(7\/30).\n\n7.\u00a0All Games should be made up. EXCEPTION: Rainouts in July will only require 1 made up game.\n\nMANDATORY PENALTY: If an AWAY team travels to the home field of the HOME team, the AWAY team shall be granted one (1) forfeit win and the HOME team shall be granted one (1) forfeit loss.\u00a0 The second game shall be scheduled for a mutually agreed upon later date.\n\n\u00a0If a DOUBLEHEADER is cancelled....\n\n1. One (1) game MUST be rescheduled at a \"soft\", later date of mutual choice, but MUST be agreed upon within one (1) week of the cancellation.\u00a0 \"Soft\" shall be defined as a planned rescheduled date, but not set in stone.\u00a0 Please notify the President within one week of the cancellation.\u00a0 The purpose of this rule is to engage in rescheduling conversation EARLIER than later, hopefully encouraging makeups ahead of time and not putting it off until last minute where scheduling gets complicated.\n\n2.\u00a0 The second game of the DH shall be made up at a mutually agreed upon later date if possible.\n\nIf ONE game is cancelled.....\n\n1.\u00a0 Both teams will agree upon a new makeup date at a later time if possible.\n\nPENALTY: No immediate penalty.\u00a0 If one specific team cannot agree to a \"soft\" date as scheduled above, President's discretion will be used to determine if the specific game needs to be played.\u00a0 If it does, forfeits may or may not be issues based on President's decision.",
