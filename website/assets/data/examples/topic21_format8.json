        "text":"Travel Center\n\nHelpful resources from the NCAA\n\n\n\nOn behalf of the UNCG Athletics Department, we appreciate and encourage your support and interest. But please know that any inappropriate contacts or actions may jeopardize the eligibility of prospects and\/or student-athletes as well as lead to sanctions being imposed on a member institution.\n\n\nProspective Student-Athlete: A prospective student-athlete (\"prospect\") is defined as an individual who has begun classes for the ninth (9th) grade. However, it is possible for a student who is still in a lower grade to be considered as a prospect. Please ask first if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nStudent-Athlete: A student-athlete is a student who is enrolled at a four-year institution and whose enrollment was solicited by a member of the athletics staff or other representative of athletics interests with a view toward the student's participation in the intercollegiate athletics program.\n\nContact: A contact is any face-to-face encounter between a prospect, or the prospect's parent or legal guardian, and an institutional staff member or athletics representative during which any dialogue occurs.\n\nRecruiting: Recruiting is any solicitation (by phone, mail or in-person) of a prospect or a prospect's family member or legal guardian. Only those institutional coaches who have passed the NCAA Recruiting Test are permitted to recruit for the institution.\n\nRepresentatives of Athletics Interests: An individual, independent agency, corporate entity or any organization who is known (or who should have been known) by a member institution's executive or athletics administration to:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a) Have participated in or to be a member of an agency or organization promoting the institution's intercollegiate athletics program;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) Have made financial contributions to the athletic department or to an athletics booster organization of that institution;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) Be assisting or to have been requested (by the athletic department staff) to assist in the recruitment of prospects;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d) Be assisting or to have assisted in providing benefits to enrolled student-athletes or their families; or\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e) Have been involved otherwise in promoting the institution's athletics program.\n\nOnce an individual is identified as such a representative, the person retains that identity indefinitely.\n\nExtra Benefit: An extra benefit is any special arrangement by an institutional employee or an athletics representative to provide a prospect or a student-athlete (or the prospect or student-athlete's relatives or friends) with a benefit not expressly authorized by NCAA legislation. The following are examples of extra benefits:\n\n  \u2022 Giving cash or loans in any amount.\n  \u2022 Signing or co-signing a note with an outside agency to arrange a loan.\n  \u2022 Employing relatives or friends of a student-athlete.\n  \u2022 Giving gifts of any kind (e.g., birthday, Christmas, Valentine's Day) or free services (e.g., clothing, airline tickets, laundry, car repair, haircuts, meals in restaurants).\n  \u2022 Providing special discounts for goods or services.\n  \u2022 Providing use of an automobile.\n  \u2022 Providing a meal other than in your home on special infrequent occasions (e.g., Thanksgiving, birthday).\n  \u2022 Providing use of your summer home to go water skiing, hunting, etc.\n  \u2022 Providing transportation for any purpose.\n  \u2022 Providing rent-free or reduced-rent housing.\n  \u2022 Providing a benefit connected with on- or off-campus housing (e.g., television set, stereo equipment).\n  \u2022 Providing tickets to an athletic, institutional or community event.\n  \u2022 Providing a guarantee of a bond.\n  \u2022 Providing promise of financial aid for postgraduate education.\n  \u2022 Promising employment after college graduation.\n\n\nDO NOT become directly or indirectly involved in arranging for a prospect, or the prospect's relatives or friends, to receive money or financial aid of any kind.\n\nDO NOT provide any \"extra benefits\" to or for a prospect, or the prospect's relatives or friends, without first checking with the UNCG Athletics Compliance Office.\n\nDO NOT write to, telephone or contact in person a prospect or the prospect's family (on or off campus).\u00a0If a coach is accompanied by a prospect on campus, in the community or at the airport, do not approach the coach and prospect.\u00a0If a prospect approaches you at an off-campus location regarding an institution's athletic program, explain that NCAA rules do not permit you to discuss the program.\u00a0Suggest that the prospect contact the institution's athletics department for information.\n\nDO NOT entertain high school, prep school or two-year college coaches at any location.\n\nDO NOT contact the prospect's coach, principal or counselor for evaluating the prospect.\u00a0You are not permitted to videotape games or pick up films or transcripts from the prospect's educational institution.\n\n\nDO feel free to attend high school and community college athletic events for your enjoyment, but not to scout or videotape for an institution's coaching staff.\u00a0While at such an event, you cannot have any contact with prospects or their relatives.\u00a0Should you find yourself seated next to parents of a prospect, DO NOT initiate conversation with them.\u00a0If conversation is initiated with you, respond in a civil manner but DO NOT discuss anything regarding a member institution's athletic program.\u00a0Direct their questions to the coaching staff or the UNCG Athletics Compliance Office.\n\nDO continue ESTABLISHED family relationships with friends and neighbors.\u00a0You are permitted to engage in your normal activities with prospects and their parents who are family and\/or friends as long as they are not made for recruiting purposes and are not prompted by a member institutions coaching staff.\u00a0Again, you simply are not permitted to attempt to recruit the prospect or discuss the athletics program.\n\nDO feel free to attend a public event (e.g., a high school awards banquet or dinner) at which prospects attend.\u00a0NO attempt should be made to contact or recruit the prospect at these events.\n\nDO send the coaching staffs any newspaper clippings or other information about prospects which you think would be of interest.\u00a0Your assistance in this way is very helpful.\u00a0 The coaching staff will then make the contact with the prospect.\n\nDO provide employment opportunities for currently enrolled student-athletes as appropriate.\u00a0 Rules regarding employment may be found on this site.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPLEASE . . .\n\nDO NOT provide any of the extra benefits listed in the \"extra benefits\" section of this site.\n\nDO NOT expend funds to entertain prospects or student-athletes, their friends or relatives.\u00a0 You are not even permitted to buy a soda or a cup of coffee for them.\n\nDO NOT provide awards or gifts to a prospect or student-athlete for his or her athletic performance.\u00a0All awards must conform to NCAA regulations and must be approved by the institution.\n\nDO NOT allow a prospect or student-athlete, or his or her friends or relatives to use your telephone or a telephone card to make free long distance calls.\n\nDO NOT provide an honorarium to a prospect or student-athlete for a speaking engagement.\n\nDO NOT use the name or picture of an enrolled student-athlete to directly advertise, recommend or promote sales or use of a commercial product or service of any kind.\u00a0Even the sale of a picture of an enrolled student-athlete would jeopardize their eligibility.\n\nDO NOT provide room, board or transportation to friends or family of an enrolled student-athlete to enable them to visit campus or attend an away athletics contest.\n\nDO NOT provide room, board or transportation\u00a0to an enrolled student-athlete for collegiate competition.\n\n\nCriteria Governing Compensation to Student-Athletes - Compensation may be paid to a student-athlete:\n\n(a) Only for work actually performed; and\n\n(b) At a rate commensurate with the going rate in that locality for similar services.\n\nSuch compensation may not include any remuneration for value or utility that the student-athlete may have for the employer because of the publicity, reputation, fame or personal following that he or she has obtained because of athletics ability.\n\nThe following rules are applicable to any type of student-athlete employment, whether during the academic year or summer:\n\n  \u2022 The rate of pay must be the normal rate for the duties performed.\n  \u2022 The hours paid must be the hours worked.\n  \u2022 Payment in advance of hours worked is not permitted.\n  \u2022 Transportation to work may be provided only if transportation is available to other non-athlete employees in similar positions.\n\nFee-for-Lesson Instruction\nA student-athlete may receive compensation for teaching or coaching sport skills or techniques in his or her sport on a fee-for-lesson basis, provided:\n\n(a) Institutional facilities are not used;\n\n(b) Playing lessons shall not be permitted;\n\n(c) The institution obtains and keeps on file documentation of the recipient of the lesson(s) and the fee for the lesson(s) provided during any time of the year; and\n\n(d) The compensation is paid by the lesson recipient (or the recipient's family) and not another individual or entity.\n\n(e) Instruction to each individual is comparable to the instruction that would be provided during a private lesson when the instruction involves more than one individual at a time.\u00a0\n\n(f) The student-athlete does not use his or her name, picture or appearance to promote or advertise the availability of fee-for-lesson sessions.\u00a0\n\n\nAll charitable, educational and nonprofit promotional activities involving student-athletes must have prior approval from the UNCG Athletic Department.\u00a0Student-athletes are not permitted to be involved in the advertisement, endorsement or promotion of a commercial product or service of any kind.\n\n\nPermissible recruiters: Only authorized institutional staff members shall be allowed to recruit a prospect or the prospect's relatives or legal guardian(s).\u00a0Boosters are not considered to be part of the institution's staff.\n\nASK BEFORE YOU ACT!\u00a0 P...
