        "text":"\n\nSri Ramakrishna (1836-1886)\n\nReligion is the secret of life. It teaches us to love, to serve, to forgive, to endure and to interact with our brothers and sisters with empathy and compassion. Advaita (non-duality) is a purely subjective experience. But in daily life it may be expressed as love and compassion. This is the great lesson taught by the great saints and sages of India, the exponents of Sanatana Dharma. Mata Amritanandamayi, Kerala-based hugging saint\u00a0\n\nWealth\u2019s nature is to be unenduring. Upon acquiring it, quickly do that which is enduring. Tirukural 333\n\nI swore that I would not suffer from the world\u2019s grief and the world\u2019s stupidity and cruelty and injustice and I made my heart as hard in endurance as the nether millstone and my mind as a polished surface of steel. I no longer suffered, but enjoyment had passed away from me.\u201d Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950)\n\nWe are all visitors to this time, this place. We are just passing through. Our purpose here is to observe, to learn, to grow, to love\u2026 and then we return home. Australian Aboriginal proverb\u00a0\n\nActions are the louder expression of thought. The quality of thought is ordered by the nature of our inner belief and faith. Swami Chinmayananda (1916-1993), founder of Chinmaya Mission\n\nIf you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies in yourself. Susquehannock proverb\n\nGrace is always present. You imagine it is something somewhere high in the sky, far away, and has to descend. It is really inside you, in your Heart, and the moment you effect subsidence or merger of the mind into its Source, grace rushes forth, sprouting as from a spring within you. Ramana Maharishi (1879-1950)\n\nWould you like to save the world from the degradation and destruction it seems destined for? Then step away from shallow mass movements and quietly go to work on your own self-awareness. If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself. If you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself. Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation. Lao Tzu (ca 600 bce), author of Tao Te Ching\n\nIf people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it wouldn\u2019t seem so wonderful at all. Michelangelo (1475-1564), Italian Renaissance artist\n\nA good teacher reveals the faults you are unable to see. Yamamoto Tsunetomo (1659-1719), Samurai and author of Hagakure\n\nWhere can we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own hearts and in every living being. Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902)\n\nOne who plants trees, knowing that he will never sit in their shade, has at least started to understand the meaning of life. Rabindranatha Tagore (1861-1941)\n\nBy your nature you are free; you have forgotten yourself in your state of slavery. A king may fall asleep and find himself a beggar; he may dream that he is a beggar, but that can in no way interfere with his real sovereignty. Swami Rama Tirtha (1873-1906), teacher of Vedanta\n\nPractice enjoying the moment. It is where we spend our entire lives. I Ching, the Chinese Book of Changes\n\nOne small step taken to reach a small milestone later helps you achieve the bigger goal. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (1830-1880), founder of the Maratha Kingdom\n\nMeditation practice doesn\u2019t stand by itself; the state of consciousness we achieve in meditation needs to influence how we handle experiences as they come to us in our daily activities. Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami, publisher of Hinduism Today\n\nThe belief in the existence of God everywhere, as an all-pervasive, self-effulgent energy and consciousness, creates the attitude of sublime tolerance and acceptance toward others. Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (1927-2001), founder of Hinduism Today\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Earliest Known Ploughed Field\n\nKalibangan\u2019s cross-ploughed field. ASI\nA model of the town site, showing the major sections. ASI\n\nIn the North Indian state of Rajasthan resides what is considered to be one of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization\u2019s major provincial capitals, known as Kalibangan. This archaeological site is unique in that it includes two major fortified sections. The lower one resembles other sites from the early Harappan culture, while the upper section boasts the metropolitan grid layout and city planning associated with later Harappan sites. The whole town is distinguished by its near universal possession of religious fire altars in the houses. These altars, for the most part, are given their own specified rooms. Unique to this site is the discovery of what appears to be the earliest known ploughed field to be excavated. The field shows that the plow was in use by the 3rd millennium bce and alludes to an unbroken\u00a0 continuity of farming techniques still used today.\n\nA view of an excavated street through the town as it stands today. ASI\n\nIn his book New Light on the Indus Civilization, former Director General for the Archaeological Survey of India, B. B. Lal, states: \u201cKalibangan in Rajasthan has given evidence of the earliest (c. 2800 bce) ploughed agricultural field ever revealed through an excavation\u2026. It shows a grid pattern of furrows, placed about 30 cm apart running east-west and others spaced about 190 cm apart running north-south, a pattern remarkably similar to the one used today.\u201d\n\n\nAre Hindus Idol Worshipers?\n\nA. Manivelu\n\nIn Hinduism, one of the ultimate attainments is when the seeker transcends the need of all form and symbol. This is the yogi\u2019s goal. In this way Hinduism is the least idol-oriented of all the religions of the world. There is no religion that is more aware of the transcendent, timeless, formless, causeless Truth. Nor is there any faith that uses more imagery to represent Truth in preparation for that realization.\u00a0\n\nThe stone or metal Deity images in Hindu temples and shrines are not mere symbols of the Gods. As Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami wrote, \u201cThey are the form through which their love, power and blessings flood forth into this world. We may liken this to our ability to communicate with others through a phone. We do not talk to the phone itself; rather we use it as a means of communication with another person. Without the telephone, we could not converse across long distances; and without the sanctified icon in the temple, we cannot easily commune with the Deity.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDivinity can also be invoked and felt in a sacred fire, or in a tree, or in the enlightened person of a satguru. In our temples, God is invoked in the sanctum by highly trained priests. Through the practice of yoga, or meditation, we invoke God inside ourself. The image or icon of worship is a focus for our prayers and devotions.\n\nAnother way to explain icon worship is to acknowledge that Hindus believe God is everywhere, in all things, whether stone, wood, creatures or people. So, it is not surprising that they feel comfortable worshiping the Divine in a material manifestation. The Hindu can see God in stone and water, fire, air and ether, and inside their own soul. Indeed, there are Hindu temples which have in the sanctum sanctorum no image at all; just a yantra, a symbolic or mystic diagram. However, the sight of an image enhances the devotee\u2019s worship.\n\nGenerally, this question is about the \u201cgraven images\u201d which are denounced in various other faiths. Yet, isn\u2019t it true that all religions have their symbols of holiness? The Christian cross, the holy Kaaba in Mecca, the Sikh Adi Granth, the Jewish Torah, the meditating Buddha, all such icons, or graven images, are held in reverence. The question is, does this make all such religionists idol worshipers? The answer is yes and no. From our perspective, idol worship is an intelligent, mystical practice.\n\nThe human mind adores the use of forms and symbols that awaken reverence, evoke sanctity and spiritual wisdom. Even a fundamentalist Christian who rejects the Catholic and Episcopal forms of idol worship, would be deeply offended if someone showed disrespect for his Bible, for he considers it sacred. His book and the Hindu\u2019s icon are surprisingly alike in this way.",

        "text":"\/ \/ Articles\n\n95 Theses for Christian Fiction Reformation, part 3\n\nIf we hope to reform Christian fiction, we need to affirm what\u2019s right about these novels.\n\nHere\u2019s the article of this series voted least likely to become clickbait. That\u2019s because, unlike the first two articles in this series about reforming Christian fiction, this article emphasizes what\u2019s right about Christian fiction. Yes, by that, I mean today\u2019s industry, today\u2019s beliefs, today\u2019s books right there on those cheesy Christian bookstore shelves right now.\n\nFive hundred years ago, Martin Luther didn\u2019t set out to split the Church. He wanted to reform it. And reformation proper means to keep what works while throwing out what doesn\u2019t. In Luther\u2019s case, it wasn\u2019t just abuse he wanted gone, but unbiblical teaching.\n\nHowever, if we don\u2019t affirm what\u2019s right with some thing, we can\u2019t expect people to listen when we criticize what\u2019s wrong with some thing. This applies whether the thing is the capital-C Church (all of God\u2019s people organized to glorify Him), or a local church, or the fiction-making industries run by Christians.\n\nBe sure to read the complete series, 95 Theses for Christian Fiction Reformation:\n\n  1. The purpose of Christian-made stories,\n  2. What\u2019s wrong with Christian-made stories,\n  3. What\u2019s right with Christian-made stories,\n  4. How Christian readers can reform these stories in the future.\n\nPart 3: What\u2019s right with Christian-made stories\n\n  1. Christian-made stories are often labeled as being made by Christians. In a world with popular culture shared by all people, yet in which every cultural \u201cgroup\u201d has its own cultural works to enjoy, having uniquely labeled \u201cChristian\u201d works can be very helpful.\n  2. Many Christian novels affirm that God, not man, is Creator of our world and morality.\n  3. Many Christian novels specifically and naturally affirm the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\n  4. Many Christian novels assume the basic necessity of God\u2019s people, the Church, made of local churches whose members preach and live according to the Gospel in the world.\n  5. By having fiction at all, Christians prove we don\u2019t believe man can live by dutiful work or spiritual activities alone. Deep down, we all rightly suspect that God has made us not only to labor six days every week, but to \u201crest\u201d creatively for Sabbaths of recreation.\n  6. Christian novels span a variety of common genres\u2014including some fantasy and science fiction\u2014and have created new genres, such as Amish romance and end-times thrillers.\n  7. Even secular culture has caught up to modern Christian tropes, such as the Rapture.\n  8. Christian fiction may include great characters, original plots, and unique style.\n  9. Christian fiction may show the world truthfully. Many novels explore topics that secular creators declare \u201cunclean,\u201d such as sin\u2019s results. Even \u201cclean\u201d stories remind us that people do exist who don\u2019t swear or fornicate, either out of tradition or love for Jesus.\n  10. Really great Christian novels inherit a tradition of showing the absolute victory of God over evil\u2014making evil look very powerful so that we can rightly see God as superior.\n  11. Some Christian stories explore the fact that \u201cmoral relativism\u201d is comically absurd.\n  12. Some novels explicitly test moralistic or prosperity \u201cgospels\u201d and show how they fail.\n  13. Quite a few Christian novels have intentionally explored issues relating to social justice, including not only abortion but racism and discrimination. Others overtly challenge the myths Christians may have in the west, such as confusing their nation with the Church.\n  14. Some Christian novels don\u2019t make their highest purpose to evangelize the non-Christian reader.\n  15. In fact, these novels can be made by Christians, for Christians, with lesser appeal for the casual reader\u2014again, like any ethnic or cultural group has \u201ctheir own\u201d creative works.\n  16. The Christian obsession with prophecy or \u201cend times\u201d novel series has, for now, ended.\n  17. Some Christian novels, even if they are not in speculative or \u201cfantastical\u201d genres, affirm a supernatural worldview, that is, a realistic worldview. Even in small ways these novels assume God exists and works providentially, or even miraculously, in the world.\n  18. Modern Christian fantasy may struggle to find its audience, but Christians can still boast \u201cour people\u2019s\u201d legacy of popular fantasy authors, J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.\n  19. The Visitation, Frank PerettiWe also have Frank Peretti, who succeeded by writing explicitly about Christian ideas.\n  20. The most popular authors, past and present, aren\u2019t pastors or spiritual leaders who try to \u201cwrite\u201d novels (often with help) in their spare time; they\u2019re actual Christian novelists.\n  21. Bless their hearts, but many Christian novels do try to explore cultures and individuals who are different from modern American Christians. For example, some novels really like exploring Amish culture, or a reasonable facsimile of it. But seriously, it\u2019s a start.\n  22. For example, this work of Christian fiction was popular last Christmas.\n\n    Christian romance may outsell Christian fantasy. But we do have other popular fiction genres, such as mysteries. (We also have prophetic speculation and Heaven speculation. Yes, that\u2019s a backhanded compliment. Evangelical imagination is alive and well, often to an unbiblical fault. Our secondary problem there is the mislabeling of genres.)\n\n  23. By now we may reasonably suspect that even older Christians, who support the above-mentioned genres, aren\u2019t really that opposed to fantasy. They just don\u2019t like it as much themselves. Or they may be like younger Christians, and get their fantasy fix elsewhere.\n  24. Growing numbers of young Christians don\u2019t want traditional genres. We want fantasy!\n  25. The decline of traditional Christian bookstores reveals a potential shakeup in Christian fiction, perhaps one to build on today\u2019s publishing structure for a Christian Fiction 2.0.\n\nWe\u2019ll wrap this series next week with part 4: How can readers reform Christian fiction?\n\nJoin the conversation\n\nBe the First to Comment!\n\nNotify of",

        "text":"Image Credit:\n\n\nThe phrase \u2018drawing a line\u2019 comes to mind looking at your birthday chart. This has to do with your relations with others and being forthright, frank or even tough when necessary. But, as much, it has to do with what might be termed your relationship with yourself, which means being tough about stories you tell yourself about certain ideas, dreams or consistently disappointing relationships. Only when you\u2019re able to state that they\u2019re not good enough, will you begin making changes.\n\nAries March 20 \u2013 April 18\n\nAs an Aries and a fire sign, you think and move swiftly. But not everybody does, as you\u2019re about to discover. In fact, it seems that one particular individual has far more to say about certain plans than you imagined, and intends to do so now. Listen. You\u2019ll be glad you did.\n\nTaurus April 19 \u2013 May 19\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your intention to be secretive about certain crucial matters. Still, it\u2019s no surprise others have drawn that conclusion. The problem is, you simply assumed they expected you to deal with everything, so proceeded without talking things through. The individuals in question, however, anticipated they\u2019d share in the decision making process.\n\nGemini May 20 \u2013 June 20\n\nOnly now are you beginning to recognise what\u2019s behind the difficulties involving timing, and in a bizarre range of situations. The fact is, you\u2019ve developed the habit of trying to fit everything in, more than is possible in any twenty-four hour day. Cut back, when and how you must. The rest will be easy.\n\nCancer June 21 \u2013 July 21\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between events being unsettled, if not actually unpredictable, and there being anything to worry about. While what arises over the coming weeks may mean you\u2019re constantly reorganising plans and juggling ideas and offers, what\u2019s coming your way will be so exciting that you\u2019ll have no objections.\n\nLeo July 22 \u2013 August 21\n\nObviously, last minute changes in plans are annoying and, equally, disruptive for others. Yet your instincts are telling you they\u2019re introducing and about vital updates. The trick is to forget about debating their worth but, instead, get involved. The more swiftly you do, the less time you\u2019ll waste on pointless questions at great length.\n\nVirgo August 22 \u2013 September 21\n\nIn early September the planet of ego and action, Mars, moved into Virgo, triggering an extensive review and the resulting changes. While you\u2019ve achieved a great deal, several remain to be dealt with. Tackle them soon. Ideally, you\u2019ll do it before Mars departs your sign, later this month, on October 22nd.\n\nLibra September 22 \u2013 October 22\n\nPluto may be the planet of truth, but it also accents power struggles. And with several planets forming links with it, over the past week or so, and as you move into mid-October, things are unlikely to be straightforward. Still, persist. What you learn and deal with will be major.\n\nScorpio October 23 \u2013 November 21\n\nIt\u2019s not until you notice how easygoing others are about asking questions that you realise how cautious you can be about such matters. That may be due to fears that you\u2019ll seem uninformed or even appear to be vulnerable. Actually, it\u2019s the reverse. Those who seek information are always regarded as courageous.\n\nSagittarius November 22 \u2013 December 20\n\nIf life becomes too predictable, you\u2019ll often do something to shake things up. With so much going on in the heavens at the moment, however, you could unwittingly ignore vital details. These may be dull but the more questions you ask, the more you learn about them, and about their significance.\n\nCapricorn December 21 \u2013 January 18\n\nThere\u2019s a fine line between being frank about your both your feelings about certain matters and any practical concerns, and turning those into issues. The real problem is the pressure you\u2019re putting on yourself to make decisions. While it\u2019s true, things are pressing, you still have plenty of time for discussion.\n\nAquarius January 19 \u2013 February 17\n\nThe focus of your thinking and, as much, what you talk about, both in brief discussions and in longer conversations will shift over the coming weeks. While somewhat unsettling, this is mostly because several of the planetary powerhouses are moving into new positions, and triggering dramatic, but timely, changes.\n\nPisces February 18 \u2013 March 19\n\nThe move by the fortunate, expansive Jupiter to a new position is part of a cycle of exciting, if sometimes unsettling, change that will unfold between now and the year\u2019s close. Knowing that, when making plans, ensure they\u2019re flexible and, even more, consider which dreams you\u2019d like to see fulfilled.",

        "text":"Top 10 Jewish Social Media Moments of 2012\n\nAs 2012 comes to a close, NJOP, and its social media brand, Jewish Treats, recall the social media moments that had us in shock, tears, stiches and pride.\n\n\nJewish Justin Bieber\n\nEdon Pinchot, an Orthodox 14-year-old from Chicago, was nicknamed the \u201cJewish Justin Bieber\u201d while appearing on the NBC reality show, America\u2019s Got Talent. He proudly wore a kippah during each of his performances.\n\n\nMunich 11\n\nThe JCC of Rockland County penned a petition asking for a Minute of Silence at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremonies in memory of the Munich 11. The JCC was joined in their petition by Ankie Spitzer, widow of one of the 11 members of the Israeli team who were killed in the terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Mrs. Spitzer recorded a moving plea to the IOC to grant the request. The petition, which garnered more than 100,000 signatures, may have fallen on deaf ears at the IOC, but viewers worldwide took note and @JewishTweets orchestrated a Social Media Minute of Silence on July 27tth across Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\nAmerica\u2019s Jewish Sweetheart\n\n\nJewish Olympian Aly Raisman, an 18-year-old from Needham, Massachusetts, used the popular Jewish tune Hava Nagila for her gold medal winning floor exercise routine and instantly becomes America\u2019s Jewish Sweetheart. Raisman left London with Olympic medals, two gold and one bronze.\n\n\nCircumcision in the News\n\nA video of an Israeli baby \u201cdriving\u201d into his own brit milah (circumcision ceremony) in a remote controlled car ignited great debate about circumcision celebrations. Another circumcision inspired controversy made social media headlines this past summer when a German court effectively banned the religious practice. Recently however, Germany\u2019s parliament approved a bill to keep circumcision legal.\n\n\nTwitter Warfare\n\nIn November, during Operation Pillar of Defense, Israel and Hamas waged Twitter war. The Israel Defense Force used social media to announce and comment on military operations.\n\n\nHurricane Sandy Destroys New York Area Synagogues\n\nJewish humanitarian groups used social media to reach volunteers in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Powerful pictures, like the one above from the Friends of Refugees of Eastern Europe synagogue in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, of a Torah which was unraveled in order to dry it out, were circulated on Facebook and Twitter showing the destruction of New York area synagogues. In poured donations of funds, supplies and even a Torah for one Long Island congregation.\n\n\nAll Things Mayim Bialik!\n\n\nReaders enjoyed Mayim Bialik\u2019s blog on the Jewish parenting website Kveller and visited regularly in 2012 for her firsthand accounts about everything from her hit CBS comedy, The Big Bang Theory to her Emmy nomination, her children, a car accident, a divorce announcement and her glamorous red carpet experiences.\n\n\nCourting the Jewish Vote\n\n(Photo by Uri Fintzy)\n\n\nPresidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney each used social media to try to sway Jewish voters in 2012. Both party conventions featured prominent rabbis, Rabbi David Wolpe from Los Angeles and Rabbi Meir Soloveichik from New York. While President Obama clearly won the election and a large majority of the Jewish vote, some analysts see the significant decline from 2008 in the Jewish support for President Obama, as a vindication of their efforts.\n\n\nStandFour Makes Their Debut\n\n\nYeshiva University Maccabeats grads created a breakaway acapella group called StandFour and garnered a quarter million views of their debut video during Chanukah.\n\n\nSupport for Sandy Hook\n\n\nThe nation joined together in mourning for the 20 children and 6 adults who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT. Outpourings of support for the Newtown community were posted across all the social networks. The youngest victim was 6-year-old Jewish kindergartner Noah Pozner. Rabbi Shaul Praver, the Pozner family\u2019s rabbi, recited El Maleh Rachamim, the Hebrew memorial prayer, at a vigil attended by President Obama and family members of the victims.",

        "text":"This Is Exactly How Much Your Home\u2019s Value Will Change in 2021, Experts Say\n\n\nYour Horoscope This Week: April 18, 2021\n\nAstrology is the belief in and study of universal territory. The sky, its expanse, and the dark mystery beyond it are ungovernable. No matter how many shuttles and satellites compete to make a claim, the planets claim themselves. In astrology, we write the story of their relationships over and over. Because one body is near another, because one planet is illuminated by a grouping of stars. On Earth, our relationships are just as valuable but, on the only planet that sustains life, we destroy it. We say we love each other, but what good is what we say compared to what we allow? This week the police killed yet another unarmed person, a 13-year-old Latino boy. This month, 33 states have introduced over 100 bills against rights of transgender people. Bills that ban trans people from participating in sports, bills that keep trans kids from accessing affirming healthcare, bills that want to remove trans kids from their supportive families. A people policed to death is a people for whom the carceral state is a past life. What if we began our new life now, and agreed that there will be abolition? We, who can feel the rumble and pulse of it begging beneath the concrete. What if we refuse the law of the land when it means to harm the people of the land? What if we are to become ungovernable, like planets, we who know another way is not only possible but inevitable. If you feel small, if you feel far from it, take a look at Pluto\u2019s distant influence. If we are to believe that the planets and asteroids and stars have their power, then imagine what the influence of all our bodies might be. While Pluto works on our values, pitting fear against faith, Saturn and Uranus continue to square off. A minor trine between Mars, Jupiter, and the Sun plus Mercury is our weekly reminder that our actions and rituals have a far-reaching impact, especially for the younger ones who will survive us. Each step we take presses down a new path. Aries Sun & Aries RisingWhen the world gets heavy, people reach for something big to believe in, but you don\u2019t have to believe in God, if God doesn\u2019t suit. You don\u2019t even have to believe in The Universe or anything invisible above or below you. You just have to believe in yourself \u2014 in what you see for yourself, and what you want badly enough for yourself to go hard. You have to believe that you have what it takes to raise the child in you and that you\u2019ve earned the right to let the protector rest. What some think of as divine is no bigger, no more sacred, than the work of loving your whole self.Illustration by Stefhany LozanoTaurus Sun & Taurus RisingYou are allowed to feel like one of the lucky ones and still be unsatisfied. You\u2019re allowed to want something more for yourself, even if you can\u2019t articulate what that something is quite yet or how you\u2019re gonna get it. What if dissatisfaction is a sign of life? What if it\u2019s proof of all the pleasures waiting for you on the other side of complacency? It\u2019s better, Taurus, for you to be honest than be humble, better for you to be human than a hero. Otherwise, you might find yourself subconsciously bulldozing what you have to make way for something that you don\u2019t. Illustration by Stefhany LozanoGemini Sun & Gemini RisingIt\u2019s not all a crapshoot, even if it feels like one on days when nothing plays out like you\u2019d rather it did. While it might not be evident right away, there are always a few stakes in the game and consequences to your actions. It\u2019s like Neko Case sang, \u201ctime\u2019s a revelator\u201d \u2014 eventually, we come to the end of a thread we\u2019ve been holding without realizing it. Don\u2019t let this stop you in your tracks, Gemini, let it give you perspective. Yes, the hurt matters, the mistakes you\u2019ve made matter and they won\u2019t pass unnoticed. But so does the good you\u2019ve done and want to do.Illustration by Stefhany LozanoCancer Sun & Cancer RisingIt can feel selfish to trust your gut instincts and make decisions about what\u2019s right for you \u2014 not what you wish felt right, or what someone else needs you to feel. In fact, when someone else\u2019s feelings are in the mix, prioritizing your own viewpoint and values can feel like discounting theirs. But, it isn\u2019t. No one benefits from your decisions to do things that don\u2019t feel good or right to you. No one gets to experience you at your best that way. Besides, you should know by now to trust your intuition and never underestimate it. It\u2019s a tool that works better the more you use it. Illustration by Stefhany LozanoLeo Sun & Leo RisingIf healing isn\u2019t linear then neither is the path we take toward it. If we can fall off the wagon and get back on, if we can cut ties with people who cause us harm and then hastily sew those ties together in a moment of desperation before remembering why we left to begin with, we can forgive ourselves for losing faith in our ability to learn a new way to live and relate to others. When you get angry at yourself for all the ways you wish you could show up, slow down and find one way. You don\u2019t have to be all in all at once, but when you\u2019re up for it, your ride is here to pick you up.Illustration by Stefhany LozanoVirgo Sun & Virgo RisingIt\u2019s only natural that what felt good to you once might no longer do the trick. Human beings are agents of change and under certain world-defining and delaying circumstances, only more so. With all that time for introspection, some personal shifts might have experienced an acceleration process. But, it takes a while for the mind to catch up with the body, to put into language what might have at first seemed like a hiccup in the spirit. It can feel like the body knows something that we don\u2019t. What you feel is more trustworthy and valuable than what you want to feel.Illustration by Stefhany LozanoLibra Sun & Libra RisingA body needs to use or release what it stores. The materials are easy enough to identify: tears, mucus, waste. But the body is full of systems that produce responses harder to see, like the endocrine system, the sympathetic nervous system, and our immune systems. Like Libra people, these systems work as mediators, communicating between stimulus and stimulated. But, unlike Libra people, these systems want to process and let go, because when they can\u2019t release, they suffer. When you\u2019re wondering whether to hold on or let go, look to your body for guidance. Illustration by Stefhany LozanoScorpio Sun & Scorpio RisingLike the dream of a past life, hopeful buds are showing up along the wintered tree of you. A week full of beautiful reminders, that relationships and projects you thought dead were simply dormant, germinating under the cover of darkness. It\u2019s enough to welcome what returns, to regard the cycling nature of all things \u2014 including the patterns of others. A budding tree will come to bloom whether you watch it or not and after its bloom, it will shed and go on about the business of greenness. If certain absences hurt you, if opening again scares you, just hang back and let time do its work.Illustration by Stefhany LozanoSagittarius Sun & Sagittarius RisingOf course you know how to stay busy, how to lend your time to whatever problem crops up. And, it\u2019s true that staying busy can do wonders for those of us who, left to leisure, are also left with an emotional state we\u2019d rather let alone. But busying oneself with whatever is furthest from the spirit is a fool\u2019s errand, you know that. You will never stay busy enough. This week might be full of people and places demanding you make good on your work, and you will. But if you don\u2019t make time to keep the promises you\u2019ve made to yourself, your word won\u2019t be worth very much to you.Illustration by Stefhany LozanoCapricorn Sun & Capricorn RisingIt\u2019s time for you to express yourself, Capricorn, to stand in the light of the golden hour. So much of this month has been about setting your limits and figuring out what you don\u2019t want. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time for you to not only figure out what you DO want, but actively set out after it? Of course the time between invocation and reception can be slower than some might like, but you know how to be patient if the reward is good enough. You\u2019ve been putting the pieces in place for everyone else long enough, set the dominoes to spell your own name and give the first one a push.Illustration by Stefhany LozanoAquarius Sun & Aquarius RisingThere are months that ask you to rest and months that show you what that rest was for. Rest is a process necessary for both body and mind. Rest can be sleeping in or declining invitations or taking trips to the seaside for salt air. Rest is, no matter how you come to it, a gathering of strength, and it can be taken alongside the daily grind or outside of it entirely. My hope for you, Aquarius, is that you\u2019ve taken your rest seriously and sacredly, because within it were lessons for the work you\u2019re endeavoring upon now. The work comes from that rest; it\u2019s possible because of it.Illustration by Stefhany LozanoPisces Sun & Pisces RisingWe shouldn\u2019t have to choose between what makes financial sense and what makes sense collectively and, in a perfect world, our lives could be easily built in service to the communities we love and care for. But, because this isn\u2019t a perfect world and because some resources are finite, it\u2019s important to approach long-term plans as if they are exactly that \u2014 long term. While some situations require immediate response, your present day solutions need not define your vision for the future. You can take care of yourself now without jeopardizing your big beautiful dream.Illustration by Stefhany LozanoLike what you see?

        "text":"New Video posts every Thursday at 10:00 a.m. CST\n\n\n1. Stop Killing Your Dreams\n\nThe number one limitation we place on God is that we don\u2019t believe how good He is.\nTo learn more about this new series and our special offer, CLICK HERE:\n\nLiving our dreams is not just about getting God to hand us something; He wants us to be the person that can live the kind of life we want. That starts in the heart through biblical transformation. Our life should be about BEING and HAVING, not becoming and getting, which is the ultimate limiting factor. God rules in our lives only to the degree that we allow Him to express Himself. Ask yourself: Do I believe in a God who is better than I ever imagined and has a life for me that is better than anything I have ever imagined?\n\n3. Fix Your Heart First\n\nHow do I know when my heart is fixed? Please watch this video as we learn the answer.\nTo learn more about this new series and our special offer, CLICK HERE:\n\nWe can know that our heart is fixed when we do not waver, regardless of the bad report that comes. Why? We remain steadfast on the promises of God. We empty our heart of all personal opinions, are humble and open, and build our lives on the foundation of Jesus\u2019 teaching. If the most valuable thing in your life is your relationship with the Lord and you are anchored in Him, your heart will hold firm in the storms of life.\n\n5. Miraculous Probabilities\n\nDo you believe the miracle you need is simply possible, or highly probable?\nTo learn more about this new series and our special offer, CLICK HERE:\n\nWhat moves something from simply being possible to probable is the fact that God proactively initiated the end from the beginning. Jesus\u2019s part is finished. We believe that and receive that. The probability for health, or finances, or whatever you need already exists and you don\u2019t need to get God to do it. It is a matter of removing the limits of doubt and unbelief from your heart and starting to conceive it in your heart.\n\n2. Why Isn\u2019t God Coming Through\n\nWhere are you, God? Why am I not seeing the results that God has promised?\nTo learn more about this new series and our special offer, CLICK HERE:\n\nThere is something limiting God in our life situation. When we are not seeing results, we need to sort out what is really going on. Approaching God from a perspective that says we\u2019re not sure if this is true or not, is to put Him on trial. Most of the time when we put God on trial, we have already decided He is not true. Every limitation in our lives is a limitation we unknowingly place upon God. Ask yourself: am I able to find fault in my own life without condemnation, creating excuses, feeling inadequate, or needing someone else to blame?\n\n4. The Power Of A Fixed Heart\n\nTake steps to a powerful and steadfast heart which does not waver at the promises of God!\nTo learn more about this new series and our special offer, CLICK HERE:\n\nThe core lie at the root of all religious theology and deception relating to God is this: God is in control of everything; therefore, the horrible condition of the world is the proof that God is not really good and He can\u2019t be trusted. Like the children of Israel, when we don\u2019t take steps to experience the power of a fixed heart and immovable trust, we put God on trial and judge Him guilty. But when your heart is persuaded of God\u2019s goodness and trustworthiness, your focus and trust will always be on God and His resources and not on the problem and your own resources.\n\n6. Lack Is Not Limits\n\nDo you trust God to meet the need in your life or do you feel He will let you down?\nTo learn more about this new series and our special offer CLICK HERE:\n\nLack is a feeling of desperation that leads us to seek an alternative source or not trust God to meet the need in our lives. When we come to God from the perspective that He will let us down, we have moved from lack to limits. Then, even though He floods our heart with His goodness, we judge God as being unfaithful. The only two battles of faith you will ever fight in your whole life are: is God who He says He is and am I who God says I am?\n\nDr. Jim Richards\n\nDr. Jim Richards combines spirituality, energy medicine, scientific concepts and human intuition into a philosophical approach that aligns spirit, soul and body, resulting in incredible health, emotional, financial and spiritual breakthroughs.

        "text":"10 Qualities Every Human Being Should Have\n\n\u201cI decided, very early on, just to accept life unconditionally; I never expected it to do anything special for me, yet I seemed to accomplish far more than I had ever hoped. Most of the time it just happened to me without my ever seeking it.\u201d ~ Audrey Hepburn\n\nIf you ask me, there are certain qualities each and every human being should have. Qualities that have the power to help each and every one of us to connect with our own selves and the world around us at a deeper level. Crafting better lives for ourselves and those around us and making the world a happier and a lot brighter place to be in. And these qualities are:\n\n1. Faith\n\nFaith in yourself and all that you are. Faith in your abilities. Faith in life and faith in the Infinite intelligence that created us all.\n\n\u201cHe replied, \u201cBecause you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, \u2018Move from here to there,\u2019 and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d ~ Matthew 17:20\n\n2. Courage\n\nCourage to create the life you deep down inside know that you deserve to live. Courage to go where most people don\u2019t dare to go. Courage to be the person you were born to be.\n\n\u201cCourage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage you can\u2019t practice any other virtue consistently. You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage.\u201d ~ Maya Angelou\n\n3. Love\n\nLove for yourself. Love for your friends. Love for your family. Love for your work. Love for your pets. Love for your planet and love fotr your life. Love for those who love you, and love for those who don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe heart that loves is forever young.\u201d ~ Greek proverb\n\n4. Deep Sense of Connection\n\nA feeling of belonging and a deep sense of connection to all things, all people and all places. Recognizing yourself in everything and everyone. Understanding the ONEness of all things.\n\n\u201cIf I go into the place in myself that is love, and you go into the place in yourself that is love, we are together in love. Then you and I are truly in love, the state of being love. That\u2019s the entrance to Oneness.\u201d ~ Ram Dass\n\n5. Imagination\n\nThe ability to inspire and feel inspired. The capacity to use your mind to create new worlds and discover new realms. To go where no one has ever gone before and craft things that nobody has ever crafted before.\n\n\u201cLogic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere.\u201d ~ Albert Einstein\n\n6. Denial of all fearful things\n\nThe ability to deny all things that originate from fear. To ignore, reject and show complete indifference towards those things that cause you to feel separate from your fellow human being, separate from the world around you, separate from the things you dreams and desires, and separate from God itself.\n\n\u201cYou have but two emotions, fear and love, one you made and one was given you.\u201d ~ A Course In Miracles\n\n7. Thankfulness\n\nAnd attitude of gratitude. Praising and giving thanks for the things that are and for the things that aren\u2019t. For the things you already have, for the life you are now living and for the many blessings life sent and will continue to send your way.\n\n\u201cWhat if you gave someone a gift, and they neglected to thank you for it \u2013 would you be likely to give them another? Life is the same way. In order to attract more of the blessings that life has to offer, you must truly appreciate what you already have.\u201d ~ Ralph Marston\n\n8. Open-mindedness\n\nA clean and open mind that welcomes everything and everyone. Without the need to judge, label and condemn the things, people and experiences that are not aligned with who you are, with what you stand for and with what you yourself believe in.\n\n\u201cWe need to give each other the space to grow, to be ourselves, to exercise our diversity. We need to give each other space so that we may both give and receive such beautiful things as ideas, openness, dignity, joy, healing, and inclusion.\u201d ~ Max de Pree\n\n9. Trust\n\nTrust in the power and wisdom of life. Trust that you are never given more than you can handle. Trust in yourself, trust in your inner power and wisdom and trust in your ability to manifest the things you want to manifest.\n\n\u201cWhen I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, \u2018I used everything you gave me\u2019.\u201d Erma Bombeck\n\n10. Detachment\n\nThe strength to let go of all things that no longer serve you. All places and all people that no longer need or want to be in your life. The ability to let go of your attachment to limitations, fears, doubts and insecurities. Taking your focus away from who you now are and placing it on to who you want to become. The strength to let the old you \u201cdie\u201d, to let the old you go, so that the new you can be born.\n\n\u201cUntil man lets go of that which he is now conscious of being, he will not become that which he desires to be.\u201d ~ Neville Goddard, Your Faith is Your Fortune\n\nAnd by simply embracing these 10 qualities your whole life will improve and you will discover yourself to be a greater person by far than you ever dreamed yourself to be. What do you say? Do you think you can embrace these qualities and make them part of your everyday life?\n\nby Luminita D.

        "text":"Top 10 Reasons Your Church Should Start\u00a0Snake-Handling\n\n\nThere are some faithful churches in the backwoods of Appalachia (almost predominantly white people) that still do snake-handling.\u00a0 Some estimate that up to 125 churches in America practice this important Christian tradition.\u00a0 But with 45,000 churches in America, it\u2019s time to write a letter or send a telegraph to your Pastor to go down to his local PetSmart or Petco and pick-up whatever venomous snake they have available.\u00a0 (And be sure you say \u201cvenomous\u201d and not \u201cpoisonous.\u201d\u00a0 Dart frogs are poisonous, snakes use venom; you don\u2019t want to sound ignorant when picking up your church viper.)\u00a0 Some of you grew up in crazy Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Lutheran, or Non-denominational churches that never did the 4th ordinance of snake-handling.\u00a0 (1st being Baptism, 2nd being Communion, and 3rd being foot washing [especially important that you wash your feet because snakes have been known to strike at particular pungent feet caused by wearing penny loafers without socks.)\u00a0 Well, just because you missed out as an impressionable child doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy this decades old practice as a discerning and sane adult.\u00a0 But if you still need some convincing, let me give you the Top 10 Reasons your church should start snake-handling immediately.\n\n\n1) Mark 16:17-18 says, \u201cThese signs will accompany those who have believed\u2026 they will pick up serpents and\u2026 it will not hurt them.\u201d\u00a0 This is clearly not a promise to the disciples (despite saying that a few verses earlier) but rather it is a command for all believers to go out of their way to pick up poisonous snakes in order to prove they really believe.\n\n2) Most scholars agree that the latter verses in Mark 16 are some of the most important verses of the Bible and were most certainly read hourly by the early church.\u00a0 In fact, most pastors who do snake-handling believe these verses are actually the key text to interpreting the rest of Scripture.\n\n3) The Apostle Paul was bit by a snake while on the island of Malta.\u00a0 In 1 Corinthians 11:1, Paul tells us to follow his example as he is following Christ\u2019s example.\u00a0 Even though he wrote that before he was bit by that snake, God probably revealed to him that he would get bit by the snake, and then wrote One Corinthians to tell us to follow his example.\n\n4) How else can you really know if you are a Christian?\u00a0 Sure, you can sincerely believe in your heart and even confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, but if you aren\u2019t unharmed by a snake bite, how could you really know for sure?\u00a0 Unfortunately, exhibiting the Fruits of the Spirit, loving your brothers and sisters in Christ, and turning from the sins of your old life and now following Christ; just is not as definitive as taking a rattlesnake fang to the neck and being totally fine.\n\n5) Christians who are afraid of snakes, are clearly still in their original sin. \u00a0God made us afraid of snakes after we ate the red delicious apple in the Garden of Eden, but now that Christ has given us a new nature, we no longer need to be afraid of deadly things in this world.\u00a0 So, if you are afraid of snakes, you need to remember that God doesn\u2019t give us a spirit of fear (2 Timothy 1:7) and thus must assume that the irrational fear you have of the hypodermic needles protruding from the unhinged jaws of these reptile death-dealers is clearly from the devil.\n\n7) Another reason you might be afraid of snakes is you have been watching too much of the mainstream media.\u00a0 If you google \u201csnake-handling churches,\u201d you\u2019ll find tons of news articles on all the people who have been bit by snakes in church and died.\u00a0 What they don\u2019t tell you about is all the times people didn\u2019t get bit.\u00a0 Also, it\u2019s a well-known fact that lizards don\u2019t like snakes and a majority of news personalities are lizard-people.\n\n8) Women shouldn\u2019t handle snakes though.\u00a0 There\u2019s the spiritual reason, i.e. God is punishing women extra for Eve and Jezebel and the like.\u00a0 And the scientific reason, i.e. snakes can smell blood and you just never know what time of the month it is.\u00a0 This is why women should sit in the back of the church because the snakes might catch a scent and bite the closest man in the confusion.\u00a0 But that shouldn\u2019t be viewed negatively of the man the snake bit, but rather we should blame the closest woman near him.\n\n9) When your Pastor has gotten a Word from the Lord that differs from Scripture, it\u2019s really comforting when he\u2019s standing in a baby pool filled with pit vipers.\u00a0 You know if he\u2019s lying than he\u2019s going to die.\u00a0 God hates liars.\u00a0 (Little known fact, 100% of snake bite deaths in the US and Canada occur to people who have lied in their lifetime.)\u00a0 But if your Pastor tells you that God spoke to him in a dream or in some other non-specific way, you can know he\u2019s telling the truth if the rattle snake he\u2019s been raising since it emerged from the egg just slithers calmly around the washed feet of your pastor.\n\n10) Snake-handling is a real attention getter.\u00a0 When you are holding a King Cobra or Black Mamba near your face, all eyes are on you.\u00a0 The most important thing a pastor can do is get all the attention on him.\u00a0 There are so many competing voices out there.\u00a0 People in your very own congregation might have those wireless earbuds straight from the Devil in their ears listening to non-snake-handlers like Matt Chandler,Voddie Baucham, or John Piper.\u00a0 But when it\u2019s the 4th Sunday of the month, and the snakes get pulled out of their pillow cases; then you better believe you will be THE talk at the after-church potluck.\u00a0 In fact, God wants nothing more than his pastors and other church leaders to receive all the honor and glory they can get during the 40 or 50 years they have on this earth before the Lord takes them home from a massive coronary because of all the delicious food God put here on this earth.\n\n\nNow remember, if you or your pastor dies when you are bit by the necrotic venom housed in the glands of most North American snakes; you can be sure it was the Lord\u2019s perfect timing.\u00a0 Your life is but a vapor (James 4:14).\u00a0 I hope this short post, inspires you and taught you a little something about snake-handling and other aspects of Scripture and church life.\u00a0 And I really, really, really hope you caught the obvious tone of this article.\u00a0 Oh Lord, please protect people that read the internet too literally, and forgive me for not laying it on thicker.\n\nOn second thought.\u00a0 Scroll down if you need the more straightforward communication.\u00a0 Remember those magazines where the answer key on the next page showed you all the things wrong with the picture.\u00a0 Yeah, let\u2019s do that.\n\nSnake-handling is a relatively new phenomenon.\u00a0 It absolutely should not be practiced in Christianity, and you should praise the Lord that your parents didn\u2019t raise you in such a church growing up.\u00a0 But beyond talking about snake-handling, I wanted to point out other issues the church has.\u00a0 I hope you noticed most of these.\n\n1) The latter verses in Mark 16 actually don\u2019t appear in the earliest manuscripts.\u00a0 This is a part of a much longer conversation but fortunately there really isn\u2019t anything too out of the ordinary in the passage.\u00a0 Jesus has brought up other similar miraculous signs to the disciples as proof of who He was and the veracity of His message.\u00a0 Now, certainly God could have us survive a snake bite for His honor and glory, but we aren\u2019t to seek such things.\n\n2) We should never use one passage as the key to unlock another, or prioritize the importance of one passage over another. All Scripture is inspired by God.\u00a0 We only \u201cprioritize\u201d in the area of more clear versus less clear.\u00a0 If one passage is clearer than another, use it to help interpret the less clear one.\n\n3) Sure, the Apostle Paul was bitten by a snake, but that doesn\u2019t in any way mean we should try to have the same thing happen.\u00a0 That could not be a stranger interpretation.\u00a0 The book of Acts is descriptive not prescriptive.\u00a0 It tells us what did happen not what should happen.\u00a0 We also aren\u2019t all called to Macedonia, nor do we have to become tent-makers.\u00a0 We are called to live with the same calling of the Gospel that Paul had, not experience all the exact things he did.\n\n4) The Scripture gives us lots of tests to see if we are truly in the faith.\u00a0 I mentioned them already.\u00a0 Playing with snakes just isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n5) It\u2019s totally fine if you are afraid of snakes, or spiders, or deep parts of the ocean.\u00a0 That\u2019s all normal.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing sinful about it.\u00a0 It\u2019s true we don\u2019t need to fear losing our salvation to any of those things, because whatever evil might come our way, our place in heaven is secured.\n\n6) Did you notice I skipped number 6?\u00a0 Just so you know, you don\u2019t have to be skeptical of 6 or 666 or 13 or any other number.\u00a0 Numbers aren\u2019t bad or bad luck or anything like that.\n\n7) Sure, the media is going to point out the stupidity of snake-handling.\u00a0 Do be careful in not being too trusting of the news or too sure it\u2019s all a bunch of lies.\u00a0 We are all susceptible to confirmation bias.\u00a0 We agree with the people who share our opinion and disagree with those who don\u2019t.\u00a0 Be actually discerning.\u00a0 Maybe your favorite politician did do something wrong.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to vilify the messenger.\u00a0 Oh, and there are actually very few lizard-people in the media.\u00a0 (Ok, I promised to be straight-forward.\u00a0 There are no lizard people!)\n\n8) The Bible doesn\u2019t speak of woman as being lesser at all.\u00a0 There are passages about women being physically weaker and thus men should be protective of them.\u00a0 There are passages that tell wives to be submissive to their husbands.\u00a0 But that\u2019s in no way calling women inferior.\u00a0 (In fact, you could argue that it takes the stronger person to be in that position.)\u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s just a matter of orderliness.\u00a0 Men were created first, realized they didn\u2019t want to be alone, and God created women second.\u00a0 There are no additional curses.\u00a0 Sin cursed both men and women differently but equally.\u00a0 We are all equal before Ch...

        "text":"Top Five Tuesday \u2014 Top Five Things Heard At Ginghamsburg UMC\n\nI spent three days in Ohio last week at Ginghamsburg United Methodist Church\u2019s Change The World Conference. I went as part of the Reynolds Leadership Program which sends 25 pastors from North Carolina to various training events four times per year.\n\nGinghamsburg is a Methodist miracle. When Michael Slaughter became the senior pastor there in 1979, it averaged 90 people in worship & met in a two room church building. Today, with Slaughter still at the helm, it hosts about 4400 people per weekend meeting in sites throughout the Dayton area. It has long been known for innovation in worship, commitment to small groups, and a focused ministry with and for people on the margins of society.\n\nThese days, Slaughter serves as more prophet than pastor; more agitator than chaplain. Because of that, he and his team of speakers delivered some memorable \u2014 and provocative \u2014 one liners. Here are five of my favorite:\n\n1. The church\u2019s job is to bring the resources of heaven down to earth, not to send disembodied souls to heaven.\n2. If it\u2019s not good news for the poor, it\u2019s not good news.\n3. You don\u2019t have to scream Jesus if you do Jesus.\n4. Stop asking \u2018how many people do we get in?\u2019 Start asking, \u2018how many people who are in are we getting out (into the community)?\u2019\n5. If you don\u2019t serve, you\u2019ll feel uncomfortable in this church.",

Add your two cents.\n\n(Before It's News)\n\nSponsored Links\n\nby Magdalena Mihajloska; Life Coach Code\n\nThere are moments when we feel like someone is trying to tell us something. Like we are being contacted by some higher power that has a message for us.\n\nAll of us had that weird feeling at least once in their life. Most of the time we try to ignore that feeling. However, this inner guidance is probably our most accurate compass in life.\n\nWe are talking about the intuition. And when we say intuition we are not talking about the \u2018over used\u2019 term you hear all around the internet. We talk about REAL intuition!\n\nReal intuition sometimes can be overwhelming. There are situations in anyone\u2019s life in which the intuition is so powerful that it\u2019s just unbelievable.\n\nWith the use of the intuition daily, even for small things, we can almost always make the rightest choice for ourselves.\n\nAnd the best part is that with using this ability, we improve it and feel it more often, and it comes more naturally without much effort.\nIntuition is the highest form of intelligence!\n\nSome scientists claim that intuition is the highest form of intelligence. It\u2019s a big chunk of information that can\u2019t be processed quickly enough by our conscious mind, but other parts of our psyche can get the message and inform us through emotion.\n\nIntuition could be very likely the language most things in nature communicate through, the universal language that humanity, for some reason, have forgotten.\n\nPsychics and shamans tap into these dormant parts of our unconscious mind to communicate with Spirit Guides or some other forms of intelligence, and reveal information from the \u2018higher\u2019 levels of consciousness.\n\nHowever, each of us has the ability to be intuitive. Once this ability was our main language that helped us survive. And there are ways through which we can all remember and unlock our dormant abilities!\n\nAre you ready to unlock the fullest amount of intuitive energy that you have inside of you?\n\nThese are the 8 ways to unlock and connect with your intuition.\n\n1. Connect With Yourself\n\nWhat does it mean to entirely connect with yourself? It simply means that you need to be in congruence with yourself. The congruence lets you be who you really are and it is of crucial importance to know how to use it. Only when you are really honest with yourself, you will be able to connect to your inner self and to connect with your soul.\n\n2. Stay In The Present Moment (In The Now)\n\nWhen we are trying to feel our intuition, we want to be present in that moment. Because only when we are in the NOW with our body and with our mind, we can receive the VIBRATION about something that is happening in that specific moment. We don\u2019t want to go in the past or to go in the future. The NOW is the best moment for any decision.\n\n3.Use Your Senses\n\nAll of us have 5 senses and we are using them daily. We use the senses for perception of different things; to see, to hear, to taste, to smell and to touch. These are the recognized psychological senses. By using these senses all at once, we can receive a lot more information than we are aware of. Try to take all the stimuli at once and hear the bigger message they all say together and not individually. Practice this in order to sharpen your intuition.\n\n4. Feel The Vibrations\n\nTry to feel the vibrations when they \u201ccome\u201d to you in your physical body. When we are congruent in the present moment and we use our senses, we can let the intuitive vibrations fill us.\n\n5. Trust The \u201cGut\u201d Feeling\n\nAfter receiving the intuitive vibrations, comes that \u201cgut feeling\u201d! However, it comes with a \u201cmessage\u201d. Before you try to understand the message TRUST your gut feeling. Connect with it. When we trust and connect with our gut feeling there is nothing to be scared of.\n\n6. Let The Soul Guide You\n\nCalm down and just feel for a moment. You are now connected with most parts of your being, even with your soul. So let your soul guide you through and let yourself find the answers you need. Your soul will translate you the message.\n\n7.Feel The Sparkling Energy\n\nStay and feel the intuitive sparkling energy inside your body. Let it be there for a while.\n\n8. Be Aware\n\nTo be aware of what? To be aware of everything written before. To be aware of the connection with your inner world, to be aware of the present moment, to be aware of your senses, to be aware of the vibrations, to be aware what your \u201cgut\u201d feeling is telling you and to be aware of your soul energy. And suddenly you will KNOW what your intuition is trying to tell you!\n\n\nBy following these steps, you will always know what your intuition tries to tell you.\n\nBy listening to your intuition you are listening to the \u2018highest form of intelligence\u2019 that\u2019s trying to guide you.\n\nPractice makes it perfect, so start today and get the best of your life.\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nMagdalena Mihajloska is internationally certified NLP Practitioner & NLP Life Coach.

If you want to be enlightened then you will accept their presence and council. . But what happens if you contact the wrong entity? Or what happens if the door to spiritual enlightenment swings wide open. There is no power on earth that has your best interest in mind. They are actually sent to rob, kill and destroy you; all the while masquerading as angels of light. The only source of supernatural hope is found in Jesus (Yeshua). All other powers bow to His glory and Kingship. Now that\u2019s an entity worth having in your life.\n\n  \u2022 goastdale\n\n    123\u2019s of true Christianity v popular & damnable heresies\n    (simply because you \u201cconfess\u201d it does not mean you actually are, the devil has deceived many of his own children to believe they are Christians 2Tim 3:5)\n\n    \u201cWHO\u201d it was (what person) that came \u201cIN THE FLESH\u201d, IS THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN WHAT IT MEANS TO BE \u201cANT-CHRIST\u201d! Even Islam claims Jesus was the Jewish messiah\/Christ who was to come in the flesh) they all deny \u201cWHO\u201d it was (what person) that came (to be the Christ) in the flesh!?!\u2026\u2026.To deny the father is to deny the son because they are one and the same person that came in the flesh!\n\n    JOHN 14: 8-20 where Christ specifically identifies himself (his person as the person of both the father and the HS; the only distinction is in \u201clocation\u201d and \u201cmethod of manifestation\u201d \u2026\u2026.Note Isaiah 9:6. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: \u2026: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, \u2026 the everlasting Father \u2026.The son, father\/Holy Spirit are all the same person, NOT like two different persons working together even as \u201cone flesh\u201d \u2026.The \u201coneness\u201d between Christ and the father is not comparable to a man & his wife, for only a fool would say \u201cWhen you have seen me you have seen my wife, how sayest thou then, Shew us your wife?\u201d Notice they asked to see THE FATHER and the response was Jn 14:9 ..\u201cHAVE I BEEN SO LONG time with you, and yet hast THOU NOT KNOW ME, Philip\u2026..Now image some fool trying to claim that statement if you asked to see his wife!?!!? You want to see the FATHER but have I been with you but you don\u2019t know me!?!?!\n\n    Jn 14 continued\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..17. Even THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH; (Jn 14:6 I AM the way, THE TRUTH,) whom the world cannot receive, .. for HE DEWLLETH WITH YOU, (present tense\/standing next to them in the flesh) and SHALL BE IN YOU\u2026 (future tense \u201cIn them\u201d) 18. I will not leave you comfortless: I WILL COME TO YOU (future tense \u201cIn them\u201d) Note: The spirit of Christ is the sprit of God and the holy spirit that is why Christ said \u201cI will come to you\u201d (to comfort them, because Christ is the comforter). The spirit was standing next to them in flesh\u2026 \u2026.latter it would come to them to be inside of them (inside of their flesh as the spirit we are given)\u2026..that is why. he would send the spirit\u2026\u2026 However, Jesus himself here makes the point that the same person who was the HOLY SPIRIT that would come was standing next to them but lets them know \u201cI will come to you again to be Inside of you\u201d\n\n    The whole point to Gal 3:20.a mediator is NOT A MEDIATOR OF ONE, (HEIS) but GOD IS ONE. (HEIS) again, point blank, identifies the number of persons of God! The \u201cbut\u201d points out the contrast between multiple persons in a mediation party v the \u201cone\u201d of God. God is not like a mediation party with multiple different persons. \u2026..\u201dthe express image of his person\u201d ( the person of God; singular not plural).Any attempt to lay claim otherwise is willful ignorance and delusional nonsense\n\n    NOTE: don\u2019t be that one in prov 26:12 over my use of the word \u201cfool\u201d here prov 18:13 ( ) \u201cBut but, the gospel of John\u2026the Gospel of John \u2026look look\u2026\u201d which is quite ironic since the gospel of John does not leave ANY room for multiple different persons of Jesus and father. However the gospel of John does leave a few verses that facilitate God\u2019s promise in 2 Thess 2:11\/ Isaiah 66:4 (take note of \u201cHAND\u201d in verse 2,14..You just can\u2019t make this stuff up\u2026God is surely laughing at these fools; Ps 2:1&4)\n\n    \u2026\u2026Mark 12:28\u2026Which is the first commandment of all? 29. \u2026Hear, O Israel; THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD: 30. And \u2026\u2026\u2026..this is the first commandment\u2026.. 31. And the second is\u2026..\n\n    TRINITARIANS CONFESS JESUS \/THEY ARE NOT POLYTHEIST BUT ARE MONOTHEIST LIKE A LIAR & THIEF WHO \u201cCONFESS\u201d THEY DO NOT ... (truncated)",

        "text":"Free Will Astrology\n\nARIES (March 21-April 19) Lately your life reminds me of the action film Speed, starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. In that story, a criminal has rigged a passenger bus to explode if its speed drops below 50 miles per hour. In your story, you seem to be acting as if you, too, will self-destruct if you stop moving at a frantic pace. I\u2019m here to tell you that nothing bad will happen if you slow down. Just the opposite, in fact. As you clear your schedule of its excessive things-to-do, as you leisurely explore the wonders of doing nothing in particular, I bet you will experience a soothing flood of healing pleasure.\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20) One of the most dazzling moves a ballet dancer can do is the fouett\u00e9 en tournant. The term is French for \u201cwhipped turning.\u201d As she executes a 360-degree turn, the dancer spins around on the tip of one foot. Meanwhile, her other foot thrusts outward and then bends in, bringing her toes to touch the knee of her supporting leg. Can you imagine a dancer doing this 32 consecutive times? That\u2019s what the best do. It takes extensive practice and requires a high degree of concentration and discipline. Paradoxically, it expresses breathtaking freedom and exuberance. You may not be a prima ballerina, Taurus, but in your own field there must be an equivalent to the fouett\u00e9 en tournant. Now is an excellent time for you to take a vow and make plans to master that skill. What will you need to do?\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20) If you\u2019re a martial artist and you want to inject extra energy into an aggressive move, you might utter a percussive shout that sounds like \u201ceee-yah!\u201d or \u201chyaah!\u201d or \u201caiyah!\u201d The Japanese term for this sound is kiai. The sonic boost is most effective if it originates deep in your diaphragm rather than from your throat. Even if you\u2019re not a martial artist, Gemini, I suggest that in the coming weeks you have fun trying out this boisterous style of yelling. It may help you summon the extra power and confidence you\u2019ll need to successfully wrestle with all the interesting challenges ahead of you.\n\nCANCER (June 21-July 22) The prolific and popular French novelist Aurore Dupin was better known by her pseudonym George Sand. Few 19th-century women matched her rowdy behavior. She wore men\u2019s clothes, smoked cigars, was a staunch feminist, and frequented social venues where only men were normally allowed. Yet she was also a doting mother to her two children, and loved to garden, make jam and do needlework. Among her numerous lovers were the writers Alfred de Musset, Jules Sandeau and Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, as well as composer Frederic Chopin and actress Marie Dorval. Her preferred work schedule was midnight to 6 a.m., and she often slept until 3 p.m. \u201cWhat a brave man she was,\u201d said Russian author Ivan Turgenev, \u201cand what a good woman.\u201d Her astrological sign? The same as you and me. She\u2019s feisty proof that not all of us Crabs are conventional fuddy-duddies. In the coming weeks, she\u2019s our inspirational role model.\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22) It seems you\u2019ve slipped into a time warp. Is that bad? I don\u2019t think so. Your adventures there may twist and tweak a warped part of your psyche in such a way that it gets healed. At the very least, I bet your visit to the time warp will reverse the effects of an old folly and correct a problem caused by your past sins. (By the way, when I use the word \u201csin,\u201d I mean \u201cbeing lax about following your dreams.\u201d) There\u2019s only one potential problem that could come out of all this: Some people in your life could misinterpret what\u2019s happening. To prevent that, communicate crisply every step of the way.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) In English and French versions of the word game Scrabble, the letter z is worth 10 points. In Italian, it\u2019s eight points. But in the Polish variant of Scrabble, you score just one point by using z. That letter is rarely used in the other three languages, but is common in Polish. Keep this general principle in mind as you assess the value of the things you have to offer. You will be able to make more headway and have greater impact in situations where your particular beauty and power and skills are in short supply.\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) \u201cLearn all you can from the mistakes of others. You won\u2019t have to make them all yourself.\u201d So said Alfred Sheinwold in his book about the card game known as bridge. I think this is excellent advice for the game of life, as well. And it should be extra-pertinent for you in the coming weeks, because people in your vicinity will be making gaffes and wrong turns that are useful for you to study. In the future, you\u2019ll be wise to avoid perpetrating similar messes yourself.\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) \u201cLove her but leave her wild,\u201d advised a graffiti artist who published his thoughts on a wall next to the mirror in a public restroom I visited. Another guerrilla philosopher had added a comment below: \u201cThat\u2019s a nice sentiment, but how can anyone retain wildness in a society that puts so many demands on us in exchange for money to live?\u201d Since I happened to have a felt-tip pen with me, I scrawled a response to the question posed in the second comment: \u201cBe in nature every day. Move your body a lot. Remember and work with your dreams. Be playful. Have good sex. Infuse any little thing you do with a creative twist. Hang out with animals. Eat with your fingers. Sing regularly.\u201d And that\u2019s also my message for you, Scorpio, during this phase when it\u2019s so crucial for you to nurture your wildness.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) \u201cDon\u2019t worry, even if things get heavy, we\u2019ll all float on.\u201d So sings Modest Mouse\u2019s vocalist Isaac Brock on the band\u2019s song \u201cFloat On.\u201d I recommend you try that approach yourself, Sagittarius. Things will no doubt get heavy in the coming days. But if you float on, the heaviness will be a good, rich, soulful heaviness. It\u2019ll be a purifying heaviness that purges any glib or shallow influences that are in your vicinity. It\u2019ll be a healing heaviness that gives you just the kind of graceful gravitas you will need.\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) \u201cWhat I look for in a friend is someone who\u2019s different from me,\u201d says science fiction novelist Samuel Delany. \u201cThe more different the person is, the more I\u2019ll learn from him. The more he\u2019ll come up with surprising takes on ideas and things and situations.\u201d What about you, Capricorn? What are the qualities in a friend that help you thrive? Now is a perfect time to take an inventory. I sense that although there are potential new allies wandering in your vicinity, they will actually become part of your life only if you adjust and update your attitudes about the influences you value most.\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) At the turn of the 19th century, Russian laborers constructed thousands of miles of railroad tracks from the western part of the country eastward to Siberia. The hardest part of the job was blasting tunnels through the mountains that were in the way. I reckon you\u2019re at a comparable point in your work, Aquarius. It\u2019s time to smash gaping holes through obstacles. Don\u2019t scrimp or apologize. Clear the way for the future.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20) The British rock band the Animals released their gritty, growly song \u201cThe House of the Rising Sun\u201d in 1964. It reached the top of the pop music charts in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, and was a hit with critics. Rolling Stone magazine ultimately ranked it as the 122nd greatest song of all time. And yet it took the Animals just 15 minutes to record. They did it in one take. That\u2019s the kind of beginner\u2019s luck and spontaneous flow I foresee you having in the coming weeks, Pisces. What\u2019s the best way for you to channel all that soulful mojo?\n\nHomework: True or false: You can\u2019t get what you want from another person until you\u2019re able to give it to yourself. Explain why or why not.\n\nGo Home\n\n\nTo Top",

[...] The molecule is a chain of eight carbons and a single hydrogen called the octatetraynyl anion (C8H\u00af). Two teams of scientists have spotted it near a dying star and in a cloud of cold gas.\n\nFor creationists, the find\u2014while interesting\u2014is clearly a far, far cry from even the most basic form of life imaginable (see our Origin of Life: Get Answers for more on this topic). But consider the plight for evolutionists: not only has off-world exploration not turned up little green men, but extraterrestrial excavations on Mars have failed to turn up signs of even basic microbial life forms.\n\nThus, the astrobiological announcements carrying the most weight these days\u2014such as this indirect discovery of a pre-pre-biotic molecule near a dying star 550 light years away (and another one 450 light years away)\u2014are decidedly underwhelming to creationists.\n\n2.

Babel for Elephants\n\nScientists from the U.S., Germany, and Switzerland have \u201ccalculated the date at which the African and the Asian elephant went their separate ways\u201d\u2014supposedly some 7.6 million years ago.\n\n4. No Creation for the Pope\n\nFrom Lorenzago di Cadore, Italy, comes a pronouncement by Pope Benedict XVI that the creation\/evolution debate is an \u201cabsurdity.\u201d The pope instead reiterated the Holy See\u2019s official approval of evolution, echoing his predecessor that belief in evolution can coexist with faith.\n\n5.

We\u2019ve shared it with lots of different people, and we\u2019ve adapted it as we\u2019ve gone along to keep it accessible and relevant to everyone present. I\u2019ve even made a version of our service sheet which you can read, print from this version\u00a0or buy for only\u00a0\u00a32 a copy\u00a0or 5 for \u00a35 (code 5for5), including the prayers and readings we use. Feel free to adapt it and use it in a way which works for your family.\n\nWhenever I mention that we do Shabbat on a Friday, everyone always asks \u201cWhy do you celebrate Shabbat? Are your family\u00a0Jewish?\u201d The answer to that is long enough for a whole post in itself, but the short answer is:\n\nYes, my Grandad is Jewish, although not a practising Jew, and not someone who passed the tradition down to us.\n\nI first experienced Shabbat at the home of my \u2018adoptive\u2019 parents when I was a student in Birmingham.\n\nWe first started celebrating Shabbat as a way of\u00a0starting a day of rest as a family together, something which is very strong in the Bible (it\u2019s even one of the ten commandments), and\u00a0we rediscovered in the first year of our marriage.\n\nThat\u2019s our\u00a0reasons for starting, but after seven\u00a0fabulous\u00a0years of celebrating, here\u2019s\u00a0ten great things about celebrating Shabbat:\n\n1. It\u2019s a multi-sensory, intergenerational\u00a0way of sharing faith together. It includes washing, lighting, reading, drinking, breaking, sharing, listening, singing, poetry, prayer, Bible verses and eating!\u00a0These elements make it accessible to people of all ages, all learning styles, in all stages in their faith journey.\n\n2. It\u2019s a good way to\u00a0have a moment in time together as a family with God \u2013 a great ritual for developing faith at home.\n\n3. It provides a weekly time to say sorry to each other and to God. And be forgiven.\n\n4. It affirms, encourages and blesses the women, emphasising that the most important thing they can do is respect God.\n\n5. It reminds us that children are a blessing and a gift from God.\n\n6. It calls us to actively live in the rest and freedom which\u00a0God gives us.\n\n7. It gives an opportunity to consciously welcome the goodness of Jesus into our lives and the lives of those around us.\n\n8. It\u00a0allows us to remember Jesus and what His death means to us in the context of our home and our family.\n\n9. It offers\u00a0a range of metaphors, symbols and rituals which touch us, stay with us and help bring us close to God in a way other things may not do.\n\n10. It is a way to celebrate God alongside our Jewish family, who have kept Shabbat for centuries.",
