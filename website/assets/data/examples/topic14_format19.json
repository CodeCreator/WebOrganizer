Female plants produce prodigious amounts of bright red, persistent berries. The leaves are dark green and small, usually less than 1 1\/2 in. long. The pale gray bark is marked with white patches.\n\nYaupon Holly is often grown in residential landscapes and trimmed into hedges, with many cultivars popular: weeping forms, columnar forms, and dwarf forms. The ornamental twigs with shiny evergreen leaves and numerous red berries have been used as holiday decorations and make cheerful accents in the winter landscape. The leaves and twigs contain caffeine, and American Indians used them to prepare a tea, which they drank in large quantities ceremonially and then vomited back up, lending the plant its species name, vomitoria. The vomiting was self-induced or because of other ingredients added; it doesnt actually cause vomiting. Tribes from the interior traveled to the coast in large numbers each spring to partake of this tonic, and it was also a common hospitality drink among many groups. It remained popular as such among southeastern Americans into the 20th century and is still occasionally consumed today, with a flavor resembling another holly drink, the South American yerba mate, from Ilex paraguariensis. Yaupon is slow-growing and tends to get thick and twiggy on the inside, making it ideal for dense hedges but requiring careful pruning to shape it into a tree. You must have both a male and female plant to have berries. Nursery plants are typically female (fruiting) and are propagated by cuttings.\n\n\nFrom the Image Gallery\n\n70 photo(s) available in the Image Gallery\n\nPlant Characteristics\n\nDuration: Perennial\nHabit: Shrub , Tree\nRoot Type: Tap\nLeaf Retention: Evergreen\nLeaf Arrangement: Alternate\nLeaf Complexity: Simple\nLeaf Shape: Elliptic , Ovate\nLeaf Venation: Pinnate\nLeaf Pubescence: Glabrous\nLeaf Margin: Crenate\nLeaf Apex: Obtuse\nLeaf Base: Rounded\nLeaf Texture: Smooth\nBreeding System: Flowers Unisexual , Dioecious\nInflorescence: Axillary\nFruit Type: Drupe\nSize Notes: 12-45 feet, but usually no higher than 25\nLeaf: Alternate, simple, evergreen, oblong to elliptic, rounded at the tip, rounded at the base, finely round-toothed along the edges, smooth, shiny, up to 1 1\/2 inches long, up to 3\/4 inch wide; leaf stalks hairy, up to 1\/8 inch long.\nFlower: Male and female flowers borne on the same plant; male flowers 2-3 clustered in the axils of the leaves; female flowers 1-3 in the axils of the leaves.\nFruit: Drupes red, spherical, shiny, up to 1\/4 inch in diameter, containing 4 nutlets.\nSize Class: 12-36 ft.\n\nBloom Information\n\nBloom Color: White\nBloom Time: Apr , May\n\n\nUSA: AL , AR , FL , GA , LA , MS , NC , OK , SC , TX , VA\nNative Distribution: S.e.

For Manhattan, where more than 80% of the homes are co-operative apartments, we turned to real estate consulting and appraisal firm Miller Samuel. OnBoard collects home sales data for counties covering approximately 80% of all U.S. households, with a focus on metropolitan and suburban areas. The company collects residential, arms-length real property transactions. Specifically excluded are sales under $25,000, vacant land and co-operative sales. In states where nondisclosure rules apply, some percentage of sale values in each jurisdiction may be estimated using industry standard ratios to the mortgage amount. The place name for each ZIP is the U.S. Postal Service's \"preferred\" city name for postal delivery. For more on our methodology and sources, click here.",
