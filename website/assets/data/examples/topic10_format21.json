Rosh Amarasekara from Humble Warrior is here to tell us about her range of plant-based drinks aimed at the health-conscious adult soft drink market.\n\nUsing extraordinary plants to create extraordinary flavours \u2013 such as reishi and pineapple \u2013\u00a0Humble Warrior is offering a really different alternative to booze and sweet soft drinks.\n\nLuhv Drinks is taking health beverages to a whole new level and they won the Drink Innovation category at last year\u2019s Future Food Awards.\u00a0 Through their collaboration with Kings College London, they\u2019ve created drinks that benefit particular parts of the body \u2013 currently these focus on the skin, the heart and the mind, with more in the pipeline. Chris Beech joins the team to explain more.\n\nThe line-up is completed by another Future Food Awards winner in Seaweed & Co, which triumphed in the Mission Driven category. Dr Craig Rose, aka Doctor Seaweed, tells us why he\u2019s so passionate about seeing this Eastern food staple become as popular in the West. He also reveals the rather surprising reason why he decided to study marine biology\u2026",

        "text":"Meet: Keith\u00a0Norman:\n\nSouth Point culinary staff fears no food\u00a0allergies\n\nKeith Norman, food safety manager at South Point, is in charge of the hotel\u2019s allergen awareness\u00a0program.\n\nName: Keith Norman\n\nCompany: South Point\n\nTitle: Assistant executive chef \/ food and safety manager\n\nDescribe your business.\n\nSouth Point has never been a traditional Las Vegas property. The hotel has always been focused on the city as a whole and how it can benefit from the role we play within the community.\n\nMy role at South Point is to be a key contributor to the success of our dining offerings. I have spearheaded our property\u2019s allergen awareness program and made great strides in helping South Point lead the way when it comes to large hotel properties focusing on food allergies.\n\nThe South Point has a unique ability to cater to a large variety of niches, and at the end of the day, our customers are like family and our main focus is making the experience prosperous and stimulating for visitors.\n\nHow do you keep people with allergies safe?\n\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time creating this program for the culinary staff. Every person involved in the dining experience is properly trained in food safety awareness. Our entire culinary staff, including servers, managers, hosts, dishwashers, chefs, food preps and more, is required to attend our Allergen Training program and Steward Workplace Safety Awareness program every year. In addition, we mandate all chefs, managers and superiors have ServSafe Certification Training.\n\nI\u2019ve trained through the Food and Drug Administration in topics such as foodborne illness investigation, agri-terrorism and food systems disasters. I have certifications from the National Environmental Healthy Association, Nevada Restaurant Association, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points and Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nTalk about the award you just won.\n\nOnce a year, the Nevada Environmental Health Association Executive Council honors one individual with the \u201cOutstanding Nevada Environmental Health Professional of the Year Award.\u201d We have routine health inspections, and it was the Southern Nevada Health District Inspector who nominated me for the award. The award is for someone who has demonstrated outstanding safety and health initiatives over the past year. It was quite the honor.\n\nWhat are examples of how you\u2019ve implemented your allergen program?\n\nOur restaurants are equipped with a special allergen kit that is purple and easily recognizable in the daily chaos of the kitchen. It consists of everything needed to properly prepare food, from cutting boards, knives, measuring utensils and more. Even the tickets generated through our point of sales system with allergen-specific food orders are listed in a different color than those of customers without food allergies to avoid any mix-ups. Once the kit is used, it\u2019s cleaned and readied for the next allergy-friendly meal preparation.\n\nAll menus are easily modified, so when customers tell us they have an allergy, the chefs will custom-create any menu item. Our menus are more like a blank slate; every special dish is prepared in an allergen-safe area to make it just as enjoyable as the original dish. The products are all stored and monitored to ensure there is absolutely no cross-contamination in each of our kitchens. We can generally adapt to food allergies on the fly, but we will also prepare special menus for those customers with allergies who contact us with advance notice.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best part about living in Las Vegas?\n\nLas Vegas is one of the top culinary cities in the world, and with the high quantity of restaurants, we have the opportunity to really build awareness of the severity of allergens. We have gained great buzz within food allergy awareness groups. In November, we hosted more than 500 guests during the 2013 Food Allergen Bloggers Conference event and Food Allergy Research and Education Walk.\n\nWhat do you do after work?\n\nWhen I\u2019m not at South Point, I educate culinary professionals and students about the importance of culinary safety and sanitation at the International Culinary School at the Art Institute of Las Vegas. In addition, I assist with nonprofit organizations to educate youth on making nutritional decisions, and I am a member of the Food, Allergy Research and Education (FARE) board.\n\nHow do you think food safety will change in the coming years?\n\nI think it will continue to gain more prominence as groups such as FARE and grass-roots food allergy bloggers work to raise awareness.\n\nLocally, all schools were recently required to have EpiPens in each classroom, which was a huge win for the food allergy fight. These are the moves that save lives and I think the more people who emphasize the seriousness of food allergies, the more people will understand the need for advanced safety techniques.\n\nWhat are the most common things people are allergic to?\n\nThe top eight are milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soy.\n\nWhat is the best business advice you have received and from whom?\n\nYears ago, a very dear friend of mine, Barbara Glanz, told me that appreciation goes a long way and it is our job to share it from the heart.\n\nIf you could change one thing about Las Vegas, what would it be?\n\nOne thing I would like to improve about Las Vegas would be the level of involvement in community events. Without the support of our community, many businesses would not succeed. I believe the city needs to strengthen involvement to help give back to those who support us.\n\nThe South Point has always strived to be an avid supporter of the local community.\n\nWhat are you reading right now?\n\nChecklist Manifesto by Dr. Atul Gawande\n\nBlackberry, iPhone or Android?\n\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 10 years?\n\nI would certainly like to still be at South Point. It has become home, and the staff and guests are family to me.\n\nWhat is your dream job, outside of your current field?\n\nI have always enjoyed speaking with people and helping them to establish who they are or desire to be. If I weren\u2019t at South Point, I would become a national motivational speaker and life coach. But in all honesty, this is my dream job.\n\nWhom do you admire and why?\n\nI would have to say my grandfather; our relationship was special. His focus, determination, attitude and commitment to family, friends and strangers on the street was admirable. He would always tell me to do what I can, while I can and for whomever I can.\n\nWhat is something that people might not know about you?\n\nI like to think of myself as an open book. I really enjoy life and making the most out of it. I think that is a strong part of the passion and drive behind my work with allergen awareness.\n\nI adore my family and friends, and I wake up feeling more thankful for one more day that I get to experience with them.",

Depends on what\u2019s in season, what people are doing around me, or even just taking a walk down the street to get inspired by what\u2019s going on.\u00a0\n\nDo you have a bartender that you just adore and look to in the industry?\n\nMy old boss Joe Anthony is always an inspiration for his palette and knowledge. There\u2019s a lot of good talent all around me at Shady and I really look up to many people that work there. From the kitchen to the bar and even management, there\u2019s always some one captivating my attention.\u00a0\n\nFavorite local bar besides place of employment:\n\nSome how I always find myself at 58 degrees. Good wine, ambiance, and culinary cuisine always has me coming back.\u00a0\n\nWhat is your favorite drink?\n\nTo Drink: Negroni\n\nTo Make: Classic Cocktails\n\nWhat is your least favorite drink?\n\nTo Drink: Mojito\n\nTo Make: Mint Julep when I\u2019m busy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt is a Friday night and you aren\u2019t behind the bar, where can you be found?\n\nAny sushi bar in town but I usually stay pretty loyal to Kru or the Shoki Ramen House.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat is the weirdest\/most ridiculous thing you have seen working behind the bar?\n\nMy coworkers are probably the weirdest of them all and my regulars keep it pretty ridiculous all the time.\u00a0\n\nIf you weren\u2019t a bartender you would probably be\u2026.\n\nIn the kitchen.\u00a0\n\nWho would you like to have a drink with?\n\nDavid Wondrich\u00a0\n\nTell us a little bit about your winning punch bowl recipe.\u00a0 How did you come up with it?\u00a0 Can you share the recipe and or tips?\n\nI actually got my inspiration on a drive home to Sacramento on the back roads of Willows, CA. Having bourbon as my spirit and passing by Buffalos, wild flowers, and dirt roads the thought of backyard family tea all crossed my mind. Growing up with country music all around me I just had to do this one as country as possible. I also wanted to create a punch that you could do from things you might find in the backyard by keeping it seasonal. Kentucky; known as the bluegrass state just had the perfect name for what I was going for.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBackyard Bluegrass Recipe:\n\nInfused granulated sugar\n\n-lavender, grapefruit peels, lemon peels, & orange\n\nand let sit for 3 days.\n\nBuffalo trace bourbon\n\nBlack tea\n\nCantaloupe juice\n\nApricot juice\n\nFresh lemon juice\n\nRothman & winter orchard apricot liquor\n\n\nTopped with candied cinnamon oranges.\n\nWho was your biggest competitor at the event?\n\nThere\u2019s always so much talent and creativity when it comes to these things. There isn\u2019t a person that competes that doesn\u2019t bring something unoriginal to the table. I will be honest though, Chris Tucker\u00a0and Chris Dooley will always bring the heat. I\u2019m just grateful enough to get to learn from them.\u00a0\n\nBest thing about being a female bartender?\n\nIt\u2019s pretty fun working in such a creative environment and hanging with all the guys. I think most people believe that bartending is a man\u2019s world but I\u2019d like to shake that up a little bit.\u00a0\n\nWorst thing about being a female bartender?\n\nI think the most important part of female bartending is being firm at times, having a level professionalism and respect for yourself.\n\nYou might also like\n\nLeave A Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.",

        "text":"One Part Love, One Part Food = Sunshinefood\n\nSunshine Food!\n\nOver the last couple of years I have had the privilege of living overseas with my husband, our first born and now the newest addition and Eat Play Love baby model (while it lasts). During this time I have met some wonderful and inspiring people and made some life long friends.\u00a0\nOne such special person is Rachel Ryder, the creative mother behind Sunshine Foods.\u00a0\nI have the privilege of having my 'Ten minutes with an inspiring mom' interview with Rachel. She is sharing with us a little bit about herself and her awe inspiring talent for making kids meals something so healthy and exciting that even we as adults want to eat them. You can follow Rachel on Twitter @sunshinefoodies and on\u00a0Instagram @sunshinefood\u00a0and check out her awesome creations! You might want to try these to get your kids excited about meal time, especially if they are picky eaters.\u00a0Following my mantra of Eat Play Love, this could not be a better suited feature!\nHere are my ten minutes with Rachel.\n\n\n\nQ. Tell us a bit more about yourself, your family and how Sunshine Foods came to life\n\nA. I'm Rachel Ryder and I live in Glasgow with my husband Tom and daughter Rosie. Originally from Nottingham, I moved to Glasgow from London two years ago to follow my husbands career. I left behind my city investment banking career but my days were soon to be just as busy as Rosie arrived one month later.\u00a0\nSunshine foods came about when I was introduced to a similar foodart page (Barebarnmaten) on Instagram by my sister. The owner creates the meals for her son and so I decided to replicate a few for Rosie. I really enjoy making them and to brighten up Rosie's morning with a fun, healthy, nourishing meal that she will eat from start to finish. My main reason for creating these meals is to see the excited look on Rosie's face when they arrive on her highchair tray!\n\n\n\nQ. Do you have any mealtime advice for new mommies?\u00a0\n\nA. I'm no expert! We usually offer Rosie fruit and veg everyday and in at least two of her meals. She doesn't always eat it but I still think it's important to offer it consistently. I also try to resist the temptation to offer alternatives if she is being particularly fussy one day. I think if she is hungry she will eat what we have offered. But I do think it's important for it to taste and look attractive. And that's where sunshine food comes in...\n\n\n\nQ. Can you give other moms some tips in creating these pretty meals\u00a0\n\nA. Sunshinefood is much easier to create using fruit. The basics to always have in good supply are bananas and raisins, and then supplement it with different seasonal fruits. I tend to buy what looks ripe and ready in the supermarket and then adapt the ideas to work with what I have in the fruit bowl!\u00a0\nIn terms of ideas, I use basic objects and then add simple extras like hearts, stars and sunshines.\u00a0\nI tend to create the plates for breakfast or afternoon snack and keep lunch and dinner to protein and veg. If I'm making Rosie one for breakfast then I'll give her some cereal and then create the plate whilst she eats that first. That saves her getting too impatient as she often wakes up ready to eat!\n\n\n\nQ. As moms we are constantly trying to balance our job as wife, mother, house wife or career woman and 'self'. What most moms are wondering round about now, is where do you find the time for all of this? How do you balance your every day life?\n\nA. I'm very lucky as I am able to work part time. It's a brilliant balance as I find the working days provide a lot of adult conversation and mental stimulation but also refresh me so that when our work\/nursery week is over we are able to fully concentrate on spending time together and doing fun things.\u00a0\nI'm also lucky as my husband is at home a lot so he is the main chef in our house! He is a fantastic cook and does the majority of our cooking. It's great as not only do Rosie and I get wonderful dinners but we also get to spend that one hour that most mums spend in the kitchen, together in the evenings.\n\n\n\nQ. Time Out. We know that special time goes into these meals that you prepare for Rosie, but there also has to be time that you take out, away from making pretty food, time just to spend with the family. What does leisure and family time for the Ryder's entail?\n\nA. We are all really into exercise. Most weekends we will visit our local gym. I love to work out either in the gym or I\u00a0go to exercise classes such as Body Attack. Rosie has recently started gymnastics and if Tom isn't in the gym or on the rugby pitch then he can usually be found surfing on one of Scotland's freezing coast lines!\u00a0\n\n\n\nQ. Family traditions that you had growing up that you still celebrate?\n\nA. Eating around the dinner table!\u00a0\nMy family always used to eat around the dinner table at least twice a week. Tom and I try to eat at the dinner table every night and Rosie eats with us so that she gets used to good manners and enjoying eating and socialising together as a family.\n\n\n\nQ. In the fun spirit of Eat Play Love, when you were a child, what did you dream of becoming one day.\n\nA. A mummy!\n\n\n\nQ. Having a child changes the way in which we see the world. What would one piece of advice or wisdom be that you would like to share with your daughter.\n\nA. Work hard and make friends. I worked really hard at school and it has paid off in my exams and career. But having friends contributes massively to your overall happiness. I hope that Rosie has plenty of good friends in the future.\n\n\n\nQ. In closing, one piece of advice for the moms \u00a0\n\nA. Hmmmm... Teach your child as you go. Talk to them as you do day to day tasks. Get them involved and try to make dreary tasks fun by counting, guessing and laughing together.\n\n\nWhat a lovely interview with Rachel. It's always nice to hear what other moms are doing and what inspires them to do so. Catch you on our next blog post.\u00a0\n\nUntil then, Eat Play Love!",

Known for his use of exotic, bold spices and surprising flavors, most recently Chad closed on the purchase of PHO 533,\u00a0a Vietnamese restaurant in Palm Springs.\u00a0\n\nKate Buckley: Chad, tell me how you came up with name \u201cDash and a Handful\u201d?\n\nChad Gardner: Dash and a Handful is and homage to my mother who was a restaurant owner and cook\u2014and it is how my mother taught me to cook. \u00a0A dash of this and a handful of that. She taught me to cook by feel and taste. \u00a0\n\nYou launched in 2011, and business is booming. Is it true Dash and a Handful\u2019s revenue grew 600% year over year, 2013 to 2014? To what do you ascribe this amazing growth?\n\nMy goal with Dash and a Handful was to be ultra luxury in the category of luxury brands caterers in the Palm Springs area. I\u00a0have a great team and they have definitely contributed to our success. I believe we have raised the bar in catering and it was noticed. \u00a0We also took on doing full event production in addition to catering. That component has helped drive more revenue to the company. \u00a0We are a one-stop shop\u2014we now can handle all aspects of any event, from small private occasions to large corporate events.\n\n11181574_953733671336026_6475053226023145029_nAnd you\u2019re continuing to grow with your recent acquisition of PHO 533, one of the top Vietnamese restaurants in Palm Springs. Will this be operated in concert with or independently of Dash and a Handful?\n\nA little of both. PHO 533 [pictured at left] will be a free standing restaurant, with Dash and a Handful maintaining its separate identity. However, we do have the great opportunity to utilize existing staffing, infrastructure and procedures already in place that will work in concert with Pho 533 as we move the restaurant into the next phase of operation as a Viet-Fusion restaurant.\n\nHow did you get into the culinary and hospitality industry? Did you always know you wanted to be a chef?\n\nI grew up in the restaurant business. My mother was a cook, restaurant owner and manager my whole life. I started working as a dishwasher and moved my way up to eventually being General Manager of some very fine dining establishments. I always had the desire to be a chef. It wasn\u2019t until I moved to Palm Springs that I went to culinary school and then started my own catering company as Founder and Executive Chef.\n\nA native of the Bay Area, what brought you to Palm Springs?\n\nI visited Palm Springs about 13 years ago for the first time. I arrived in Palm Springs at night, so didn\u2019t really see the city or mountains until I woke up the next morning and saw these awesome mountains come right down into the town. I was amazed and awed, fell in love at that moment, and moved here one year later.\n\n19620_948584148517645_3484529054133451926_nWhat\u2019s your restaurant philosophy\u2014your mission statement, if you will?\n\nTo provide a wonderful experience\u2014with quality ingredients\u2014that exceeds guest expectations. I believe you can do that with an ultra-luxury catering company like Dash and a Handful as well as with a more casual dining restaurant like Pho 533.\n\nWhat would you say is your signature culinary style?\n\nI am definitely a proponent of fusion and global cuisine.\u00a0I like to source flavors and components from different cultures and blend them together in a way that surprises people a bit\u2014in a good way, of course\u2014and evokes a curiosity about and an engagement with what they are eating.\n\nIMG_2707And do you plan on changing the menu at PHO 533 to reflect this? How will you put your unique twist on this new venture?\n\nI\u2019m a steward of Anh Ho Rock\u2019s recipes and cuisine now that I have taken the reins at Pho 533, however I have and will continue to imbue my personality and culinary philosophies to the existing Vietnamese menu. We will become more and more Viet-Fusion. I look to my colleagues and mentors in the culinary world for inspiration as I continue to put my twist on the menu at Pho 533.\n\nFor example, a chef I deeply admire is Charles Pham of the Slanted Door in San Francisco. We have introduced a take on his famous \u201cShaking Beef\u201d as a sort of homage to him as one the pioneers of Viet-Fusion cuisine in the United States more than 20 years ago. Our Shaking Beef is prepared with a grass-fed tenderloin of beef saut\u00e9ed in our house-made nuoc cham sauce with crispy fried garlic and shallots and served on a bed of Mizuna (Japanese spicy greens) and baby watercress tossed in a spicy yuzu lime vinaigrette.\n\nSounds delicious! What\u2019s your favorite and least favorite food?\u00a0\n\nTrying to pick a favorite food is like trying to pick your favorite child. That\u2019s a tough one! I like so many flavors and spices, fresh and seasonal ingredients. I guess I would have to say, my favorite food is whatever makes me say WOW when I taste it! \u00a0But it could something as simple as an heirloom tomato fresh out of garden or a perfectly seasoned and cooked New York Steak. Least favorite\u2026I don\u2019t know that I have a least favorite, I will give most things a chance.\n\nWhen you\u2019re not busy transforming the dining experiences of Greater Palm Springs, what do you enjoy doing in your spare time?\n\nI spend time with my husband, Roly and our two dogs. We enjoy traveling and getting to the beach any opportunity we can. \u00a0A good movie is always a great distraction from the day-to-day of providing service and being a host to others.\n\nAnd what is it you love most about Palm Springs?\n\nPalm Springs is Shangri-La to my husband and me. It is living in paradise. We are so fortunate we are able to live and work in place that is so special! It is so friendly and wonderful here. You know you are home when you come back from traveling and see the sign that says HWY 111, or you see those beautiful mountains as you come in for a landing at the airport, and you feel a sense of calm and belonging. Palm Springs is best the place in the world for us. Palm Springs is home!\n\nShare on Facebook\nLike 5 People Liked this\n\n3 comments to\u00a0Spotlight: An Interview with Chef\/Restaurateur Chad Gardner\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\n\n\nYou can use these HTML tags\n\n<a href=\"\" title=\"\"> <abbr title=\"\"> <acronym title=\"\"> <b> <blockquote cite=\"\"> <cite> <code> <del datetime=\"\"> <em> <i> <q cite=\"\"> <s> <strike> <strong>",

        "text":"Peter Bickerton on why we should all try eating\u00a0insects\n\n\nIn a bid to come up with a working solution to the world\u2019s food security issue, Peter Bickerton found his research kept returning to Entomophagy (eating insects). Ok, perhaps he didn\u2019t feel quite so confident that he had found \u2018the solution\u2019, but with 80% of the worlds population already enjoying insects as part of their daily diets, he was curious as to why the West depended so heavily on cattle for their sustenance. Almost four years later, Peter no longer eats meat but occasionally treats himself to insects which he describes as \u2018delicacies\u2019.\u00a0\n\nSustainability is a pressing issue, and so I met Peter to discuss whether he thinks insects are a genuine solution to this rapidly growing problem, and asked whether (in all honesty) he does enjoy eating them.\u00a0\n\nWhy did you first start eating insects?\u00a0Sustainability and food security mainly. I came across\u00a0Thought for Food\u00a0in 2011 and decided to enter because I had a real interest in what they were trying to achieve.\u00a0Thought For Food is\u00a0an international competition for students where the aim is to come up with a solution to the global food crisis in teams of 3-5 people (from any university in the world). We came up with so many ideas, and thought of so many things; we researched the whole system. In the end insects seemed like the most realistic solution.\n\nI\u2019d never really thought about it before then. Well, living in England you don\u2019t really have to think about it. If you see a cow in a field it looks like a pretty sustainable way to produce meat. They fart a lot, but the resource use isn\u2019t that bad. That\u2019s what you can see, but that\u2019s not the case everywhere around the world. Most cows don\u2019t live in grassy fields; cattle are fed with grain in most cases, so rainforest is chopped down to plant more grain, and then cattle also need a massive amount of water as well. Cattle and livestock account for about 70% of our global water intake. There\u2019s something like 1.5 billion cattle of the planet, so there\u2019s more cow than human in terms weight and mass, and cows consume 15 times more than we do. On a daily basis the amount of waste created by animals in America alone is 100 times the whole human population. That\u2019s 100,000 metric tonnes of waste a minute. It\u2019s insane. The waste is a big problem. It\u2019s not managed properly and a massive amount goes into the rivers. It\u2019s terrifying.\n\n\nIn the \u2018Thought for Food\u2019 competition, once you\u2019ve had your initial idea they send you materials to help you brainstorm and then they set you up with really interesting and amazing people from around the world \u2013 people in business or agriculture \u2013 and they help you to develop your idea. In the end the teams sell their idea as if it\u2019s a business plan \u2013 It\u2019s like social entrepreneurship.\n\nThere\u2019s public judging and then a panel of judges too \u2013 I was a judge two years ago actually. The competition is very young at the moment, but it\u2019s created a real movement; it\u2019s ended up more than a competition. Now there\u2019s a load of people who are going around and doing projects that are related to food security. The winner is only one tiny aspect of it really because now there are lots of really cool projects going on around the world. For example, I\u2019m still working with insects and I don\u2019t eat meat anyone \u2013 that was initiated from the idea our group had for the competition 3 or 4 years ago.\n\nDo you think insects could be brought into normal life in the UK?\u00a0It\u2019s all down to attitudes and perception. I\u2019ve thought about it loads and it\u2019s really frustrating that there\u2019s this perception that insects are disgusting. If you grew up in the Central African Republic or somewhere similar, a caterpillar would be the equivalent of a steak. I\u2019ve had one of those big, massive beetle larvae and it was unbelievably tasty, but the way it looks does make an impact. I grew up watching Indiana Jones and in the first movie where he\u2019s clawing through all of those bugs\u00a0 it does look so disgusting, and that in James Bond too, where there\u2019s a tarantula crawling over him and we are lead to feel anxious about it. Insects are\u00a0filmed in a certain way, to create a certain reaction, but really they are not harmful \u2013 in a real-life situation they\u2019d most likely be hiding away.\n\nThere\u2019s stuff that we consume regularly that is genuinely disgusting, like beer for example. The first time you try beer as a child you react by going \u2018urgh\u2019 \u2013 well, it is the fermented waste products of rotting yeast, barley, hops and sugar. It is revolting. Yet its consumption is accepted and encouraged in public because of its nice side affects. If we can convince people that there is positive side to eating insects then there is always a way in. It is always going to be hard though.\n\n\nWhat was your first experience of eating insects? The first time was horrible. I was pretty skint because it was during the 3rd year of my PHD, and I ended up buying these vacuum packed locusts. I can\u2019t even describe how horrible it looked: a congealed mass of horrible-ness. I\u2019m pretty sure these were the kind of locusts that were only supposed to be fed to reptiles, but I thought, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re going to go for this!\u2019 So, me and my mate Niall spent two hours taking the wings off these awful squashed things; I was determined. We made burgers and they were actually really good. At that time I was just looking into it as an idea, so we replaced half the meat with the locusts and we thought at least if we did that then we\u2019d cut down half the meat we consumed. They were so good, and we were so surprised. They had a really nutty aroma. We made a little locust salad to go with it too.\n\nAre they expensive? Well, yeah they are. But no more expensive than say a piece of salmon at the supermarket. Or a proper prime cut of meat. I get my locusts alive now; they come from an insect breeder in Somerset. I used to get them in big sack of about 100 and you\u2019d pull out the box and they\u2019d start to swarm. You\u2019ve got to take them out of the box alive \u2013 you don\u2019t want to eat dead locusts. Although, saying that, the chance of catching anything from insects is much less than from meat. You\u2019re not going to catch SARS from a locust. They\u2019re so far removed from us in the food chain that they\u2019re probably a better thing to consume. I like to get them alive and then freeze them so that I know I\u2019ve killed them. I am the locust abattoir. It\u2019s very biblical when they come crawling out, but it\u2019s pretty exciting.\n\nDo you eat them to make up for protein because you don\u2019t eat meat? No, it\u2019s not for protein. I think people have weird misconceptions about food because of magazines like mens health; it\u2019s all about getting protein and getting \u2018well hench\u2019. In reality you get everything you need from a balanced diet. You could not eat meat and never eat insects and you wouldn\u2019t ever have issues with protein intake.\n\nWhy do you eat them then? Do you really enjoy eating them? Yes, absolutely.\n\nThe way I look at it now is that I\u2019m trying to change people\u2019s attitudes towards food. I use insects more as an ingredient rather than the main bit, and it\u2019s genuinely a delicacy, but a really sustainable delicacy. In reality, meat is supposed to be eaten\u00a0occasionally; it used to be. Now it\u2019s become an everyday thing. I used to be guilty of having a sausage butty in the morning, then a chicken sandwich for lunch, and meat in the evening again, but in the 50s, for example, meat was for special occasions. A big piece of beef would be saved for a Sunday Dinner. I wanted to get away from having a big meaty centre piece with other smaller accompanying things like a few chips, but instead I realised that meat doesn\u2019t have to be the main part. The insects are perfect for blending into a dish.\n\nDo you cook insects for friends? Yes, definitely. My mate Chris was doing a masters in Plymouth, and he used to work at pizza Express, and I stayed with him for a while while I was doing my PHD. He got his work extras like tomato sauce and we\u2019d cook them up with the insects. We\u2019d make a lovely locust bolognese.\n\nMy girlfriend has been really receptive to the insects; she\u2019s very open minded. In fact, the other night some guys came round to do some filming, and after that we sat on the sofa and got through about 50 locusts together. I fed the film crew locusts that day too. It\u2019s amazing that every time I feed people locusts they really love them. I\u2019ll have some insects with a couple of mates round my flat, with some drinks and I take them to parties. I can\u2019t afford to eat them all the time at the moment because it\u2019s not economically viable for me, but I\u2019d like to, and when I\u2019ve got the chance I\u2019ll treat people to them.\n\n\nBaked Locusts with cumin, paprika, lemon, salt and honey\n\nCould you breed your own insects?\u00a0Yeah, definitely. Locusts aren\u2019t actually the most sustainable insects because they have to be kept at a temperature of 30 degrees C, but compared to producing meat they\u2019re still a lot more sustainable. Crickets are ok to breed in Britain, and they\u2019ll feed on all sorts.\n\nHave you come across others who eat insects?\u00a0Yes, there\u2019s quite a big movement but it\u2019s all spread out around the world. Holland appears to be the main place; they love it in Holland! I know a guy called Ger van de Wal, and he\u2019s got a business called Deli bugs. He freeze-dries them and sends them over. There\u2019s about 8 restaurants in Holland where they cook insects. There are a couple in London too. There\u2019s a company called Eat Grub\u00a0and a group called Ento. Ento are really interesting. They\u2019re trying to make food with insects, but their products don\u2019t look like insects. They make gourmet snacks.\n\nIn Mexico some insects are a delicacy, and you\u2019d pay the equivalent of 20 dollars a plate for them. There are these things called Gusanos which are also known as the Maguey Worm and there\u2019s Escamoles which are ant larvae. Although, it\u2019s not always a good thing to eat insects though, because some are so sought after and eaten so fr... (truncated)",

        "text":"Steven and Rachel Sun of Fortune Noodle House Make Their Mark on Clifton\n\nThe Chinese immigrants serve authentic hand-pulled noodles that keep customers coming back.\nSteven Sun\n\nPhotograph by Jeremy Kramer\n\nWhat brought you to the United States?\nIn China, I went to medical school back in 1984, graduated in 1989, and practiced for nine-and-a-half years. I first landed at medical school in Wisconsin as a visiting scholar in 1998. We fell in love with this country, and we just decided to stay.\n\nAnd to Cincinnati from Wisconsin?\nI had some difficulty becoming a doctor in this country. At the time, my visa status didn\u2019t allow me to work as a resident, even though I passed the board exam. I went back to school and started from scratch, and I got my master\u2019s degree in computer science. I landed my first job in Milwaukee with a pharmaceutical company. That\u2019s how I got started in sales operation. Since then I\u2019ve always been a sales operation guy. Back in 2007, we moved because the company was bought out by another big pharmaceutical company, so I found a job here. I still work for a medical device company focusing on the instruments for the atrial fibrillation treatment.\n\nWhat made you decide to open a restaurant?\nMy wife Rachel. She used to be a full-time mom staying at home with our kids. We don\u2019t have any young kids [anymore], so Rachel wanted to do something for herself. I said, \u201cWhat is your passion?\u201d and she said, \u201cMy passion is cooking and serving people.\u201d\n\nHow did you settle on Chinese noodles, specifically?\nWhen we started this idea\u2014when she had this idea\u2014I said, \u201cHoney, we have to prepare, because we want to open a restaurant with a specialty. We can\u2019t just do what everyone else is doing.\u201d She said, \u201cWell, how about noodles? Everybody loves noodles.\u201d We went to the East Coast [to do research]. We visited New York while we were visiting our daughter, so we were looking at what\u2019s the cool noodles around town? We stopped by Philly\u2019s Chinatown, and they have a handful of tiny noodle places, but they were all packed. So we were inspired by that. Hand-pulled noodles are a very common [method] with thousands of years of history in China.\u00a0Why can\u2019t we do this in Cincinnati?\u00a0We hadn\u2019t seen that in Cincinnati yet. We started with the noodles, and then we needed side dishes, so we brought in a chef. In China, Southern countries focus more on seafood, like Cantonese, and more rice dishes because of the warmer weather, where they can grow the rice. In the Northern region, they can only grow wheat to make the flour, [so] that\u2019s why noodles are so predominant.\n\nRachel Sun\n\nPhotograph by Jeremy Kramer\n\nThis block is full of other Asian restaurants. Was that intimidating or reassuring?\u00a0There\u2019s an old Chinese saying: \u201cIgnorance is fearless.\u201d At the time, we didn\u2019t have any experience in the food industry, but one thing was for sure: We said, we\u2019re unique, because we bring something different that other people cannot offer. We had the confidence and said we had to take a chance. Our mentality is simple: We\u2019re not copying anything they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re each distinct for a reason; they still can shine, they can still do their thing, but we offer our unique thing.\n\nUC has a lot of Chinese students. Do they visit and say the food reminds them of home?\nSome do. Mostly they say, this noodle is delicious; it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve had. But some people [who] mention it reminds them of home. I remember two specific students who were from California and New York. Both of them mentioned that they had hand-pulled Chinese noodles before. This reminded them of that.\n\nWhy do you think hand-pulled noodles are far superior to premade?\nFirst of all, hand-pulled noodles are fresh made. Every single dish is fresh made minutes before [serving]. Every morning we make [the noodle dough]\u2014and actually several times throughout the day my wife makes multiple batches, or else it wouldn\u2019t be enough. It\u2019s labor intensive, but it\u2019s fresh and it\u2019s chewier and it\u2019s healthier, too, because there are no preservatives.\n\nIn the years you\u2019ve lived in the U.S., do you feel that Americans have become more adventurous as far as trying new-to-them Chinese cuisine?\nOverall, I think Americans are the most open nation or group of people I\u2019ve ever seen. I travel for my job to Europe and Asia, and most of those older countries have their own concepts [of cuisine], and they\u2019re relatively conservative. They don\u2019t open themselves to try new things. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because the history or background of this country, but [Americans] are so friendly and open to new concepts. Any ethnic restaurant, if you\u2019re doing a good job and sticking with your authenticity, you will be successful, in my personal opinion. People are open. That\u2019s on the bigger scale. On the smaller scale, some people will look over the menu for 30 minutes and then order chicken fried rice, and I say, \u201cOh come on! Try something else!\u201d The majority are very open. But some [dishes people order] are very authentic, and we\u2019re surprised that they try it and love it.\n\nWhat are you most proud of as a business owner?\nThere\u2019s a fulfillment. My wife and I, if we see our customers happy, we\u2019re even happier. Whenever I see a one-star review on Yelp, it makes me so mad and nervous, because I\u2019m that type of person; I\u2019m hard on myself, and I want everything the best for every customer. I care about their feedback. When I see a five-star review, I get so excited I text my kids, and they go, \u201cDaddy, you did it!\u201d We\u2019re not a big restaurant. We sell small. All we can do is the best service, best food\u2014fresh, clean, authentic\u2014that\u2019s how we can win. Otherwise, why even bother?\n\nHow do you connect with your customers on a personal level?\nWhen I\u2019m not working the cash register, I\u2019m walking around and talking to people. Some people are already my friends. Some people I know them but not well, but every time I welcome them, asking them, \u201cHey, how are you doing? Do you want to try something?\u201d They always ask me what I recommend and if there\u2019s anything new on the menu, so I always chat with them and introduce some background to them.\n\nWhat are you recommending right now?\nI always recommend the pan-fried noodles, of course. Then with the side dishes, I recommend the cumin lamb neck. To me it\u2019s kind of a symbolic thing for our chef and her technique. Another favorite is the Dragon\u2019s Favorite Eggplant. That\u2019s my personal favorite.\n\nFortune Noodle House, 349 Calhoun St., Clifton Heights, (513) 281-1800\n\nFacebook Comments",

In 2009, he launched his first solo restaurant, Mo-Chica, in a food court near the USC campus in Los Angeles. Two years later, he was named \u201cBest New Chef\u201d by Food & Wine magazine and opened Picca in Beverly Hills\u2014it\u2019s now a semifinalist for a James Beard Award. We tracked down the culinary phenom at The Taste to talk home cooking, favorite dishes and the future of food.\n\nMADE MAN: You\u2019ve been called the father of modern Peruvian cuisine. What are some of the staples of Peruvian cooking?\nI\u2019m from the coast, from Lima. We are very strong in seafood. I come from a town that is very traditional, so I like to elevate those traditional dishes to the next level.\n\n\nI think cooking is history, so first you have to watch your mom. Everything comes from family, and that\u2019s why we have to respect food.\n\n\nMM: What\u2019s your favorite dish to make?\nRZ: I have a few of them. The oxtail from my restaurant Mo-Chica, the Colita de Rez. Another favorite is the Sangrecita Morcilla, a crostini with quail egg, brie cheese and jalapeno salsa. From my restaurant Picca, I like the Anticucho Black Cod and the Chicharron de Costillas, a crispy pork ribs crostini with sweet potato puree, feta cheese sauce and salsa criolla.\n\nMM: How is your first restaurant different from your second restaurant?\nPicca is more like a Peruvian version of tapas, and I put some Japanese flavor in there. Mo-Chica is more traditional Peruvian food.\n\nMM: Do you ever watch any of the reality cooking competitions on television, and would you ever compete in any of them?\nI wish! I mean, my life is all about cooking. So, who wants to challenge me?\n\nZarate\u2019s Unagi Causa Roll at Picca. See more tasty bites in our 7 Seas of Seafood gallery.\n\nMM: If a guy is used to picking up take-out every night, how would you encourage him to begin cooking?\nI think cooking is history, so first you have to watch your mom. Everything comes from family, and that\u2019s why we have to respect food. Also, look at the food movements\u2014in the eighties it was the French, then Italian, now the Japanese. Cooks are combining different ingredients from different cultures for new, exciting flavors. So they can try to do that.\n\nMM: What direction do you see food headed in the next 10 years?\nIn the future, there will be more humanity. Right now, it\u2019s about using more ingredients from different cultures. I just saw Ludo Lefevre making Thai food. I think it\u2019s good. Understanding different cultures is very important. Through the food, it\u2019s a good way to know people and to know cultures, and it will maybe change the world.\n\nMM: By the way, congratulations on having Picca named as a semifinalist in the 2012 James Beard Awards!\nThank you. I hope I win!\n\nYou can follow Zarate on Twitter here.\n\nPhotography: Stephanie Nelson",

        "text":"BAZAAR Dining Out Guide: Copenhagen Chef Bo Bech\n\nBo Bech\n\nWhat\u2019s your secret to being personal?\n\nI think the most important mindset here is to have passion. That\u2019s why people love chefs, but also fear them\u2014we are so direct, like \u201clife and death\u201d. I had Paustian for 8 years, and then I realized that everything was too white and clean. I started seeing that every gesture I made sort of pushed away the human feel away. The way I look at a restaurant is that it\u2019s either feminine or masculine. The masculine mindset is, I\u2019d go there because of a specific thing they think this place is unique for. The feminine mindset is, \u201cLet\u2019s go there because it\u2019s so cozy\u201d. In my view, it\u2019s never been possible to visit a restaurant that accommodates both mindsets. So I thought, why not make that attempt, so I can find out if there really is a reason behind having these two mindsets, or if it was even possible.\n\nBo Bech\u2019s Nordic Italian mash-up, Lou Lou\n\nIs that how Geist was born?\n\nThe attempt was to create a cozy restaurant for the guys. I try to do the best type of food as you would at a gourmet restaurant, but never tell your guests. I thought, \u201cWhat if you remove all the things you don\u2019t pay for, but get anyway?\u201d I understand that sometimes you get a little tired of food always having to have a thought.\n\nBo Bech\u2019s signature langoustine with yuzu and hibiscus\n\nWhat drives your food? Is it art, music, or emotion?\n\nI look at it as telling a story, basically. My food is very seasonal driven. I think some people understand it, some don\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s not a religion, you don\u2019t need to understand it. Is it funny to eat strawberries in the winter? Is it funny to devour in a heavy chocolate cake in 45\u00b0C weather? It\u2019s overpowering. So you should present with where you are and how the food is. The more you love something, the closer you are to understanding the definition of it. It\u2019s something you can only tell after you\u2019ve done it a thousand times. I think Geist probably defined \u201cspace\u201d more accurately. The intention is to make everything look industrial. In 2001, I lived in New Delhi, and I remember going somewhere with my architect friends, and I said, \u201cOh, so they\u2019re still fixing the place,\u201d and they said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s the d\u00e9cor.\u201d\u00a0 They were making new look old. The whole restaurant scene \u2026 it\u2019s become fashionable to be unpretentious. It\u2019s become fashionable to be sloppy, but there\u2019s a fine line.\n\nIn My Blood\n\nWhat do the five pillars in your new book, In My Blood, mean to you personally?\n\nIn My Blood was written and created the same way I would do a menu. It started out with a feeling of something that eventually led to a dish. I realised when I think about food, I have different pillars. For example, \u201crage\u201d is when I taste a product that I don\u2019t understand. I used to have a love hate relationship with endives because it was so bitter. It was an ongoing battle that took years to perfect. Then there\u2019s this pillar called \u201cjourney\u201d, a humbling phase where you travel to a place, where you meet new people and discover new ideas, your heart is open, and in a way you\u2019re searching, but not really, you\u2019re soaking up the good energy. \u201cTribute\u201d is when you celebrate beauty. I like to take a product and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to celebrate language through this. I\u2019ll put it on a pedestal.\u201d Then, I say, \u201cI want something like a supporting actor for this dish.\u201d I want a provocation, but nothing that doesn\u2019t have a significant reference. For example, I\u2019ll dust hibiscus on it. There\u2019s bitterness in the hibiscus, and I like this chromatic view of playing with shady red colors. It\u2019s an homage to the Little Sun project by one of my favorite artists, Olafur Eliasson.\n\nYou wrote, \u201cThe truth is easier to remember than the lie,\u201d in your last book What Does Memory Taste Like?. How does food tell the truth for you?\n\nYou know when visit someone in their apartment? You\u2019re in their sanctuary, and you see who they really are. You observe their taste, and their likes and dislikes. With certain people, you don\u2019t even have to try to tell the truth, you\u2019re just being you. Some people tend to look at my food, and say things like \u201cminimalistic\u201d, \u201csimple\u201d, etc. The reality is, it\u2019s boiled down to the essence of what I actually want to tell. It\u2019s ripped apart from all the bullshit, of the insecurities. A lot of dishes created today are very safe. It\u2019s always a little bit crisp, a little soft, a little caramelized \u2026 I think it becomes boring to continue using the same picture to tell the same story. But if you change that game constantly, you\u2019re choosing to only have one focus, being very clear in your expression. That\u2019s exactly what I try to do with my food.",

It\u2019s all i really know, it has been in the family for over 40 years and i have been a partner in the business with my mother since 2009.\n\nMcCain: What do you believe makes your business successful?\n\nJason: Customer service and going the extra mile such as table service, no corkage which is important to my customers. My dad was such a big character in the business which was key! I am slowly getting his charisma and getting the customers laughing. We rely heavily on our regulars through winter, who keep coming back because of the consistency of our food. Our customers know they are going to get nice, thin crispy battered fish and fries that are always hot and crispy with a great flavour.\n\nMcCain: What is currently your trending signature dish on the menu?\n\nJason: Battered fish and chips are always our biggest seller. People just love quality fish & chips. It\u2019s an aussie tradition.\n\nMcCain: You currently have on your menu McCain cream flesh 13mm, what made you select these fries for your business?\n\nJason: I personally love them, they have an amazing potato flavour they are also consistent in quality, and have a nice crunch to them. I trialled them for two weeks and the customer reviews i got back were amazing, so i had to stay with them. That was over 7 years ago now!\n\nMcCain: Are you aware how much profit you make on fries per serve\/plate?\n\nJason: I am aware, but i\u2019m not overly concerned with that, i\u2019m more focused on getting volume of customers through our doors. For me it\u2019s more about quality of fries over profit to grow the business and keep customers coming back for more.\n\nMcCain: There are a lot of fish & chips outlets everywhere, how do you deal with all the competition? What do you do differently to stand out?\n\nJason: I cook everything to order. People will wait longer, but they will come back because they know it\u2019s fresh. I cook fries from frozen and it gives better end product every time.\n\nMcCain: What do your customers want in terms of fries?\n\nJason: Good value, crispiness and consistency.\n\nDo you sell loaded fries? If yes, what do you currently have on the menu?\n\nJason: Yes, we sell cheesy loaded fries in winter with a mornay style sauce which are very popular. The McCain cream flesh 13mm work very well for this.\n\nMcCain: What advice do you have for fish & chips business owners when it comes to selecting fries?\n\nJason: There is no substitute for quality, that\u2019s why i use McCain premium fries. A long time ago, before McCain we did try to use a lower grade fry but ended up losing a lot of business. We then switched to McCain fries and have grown since!\n\nMcCain: How do you get new ideas for your menu?\n\nJason: I look at market trends and what is working with competitors, or sometimes great ideas just come to me.\n\nMcCain: What inspires you as a fish & chips business owner?\n\nJason: In all honesty i love what i do and its good money. It\u2019s definitely hard work, you wouldn\u2019t do it if the money wasn\u2019t great.\n\nMcCain: Tell us about your relationship with McCain, why do you choose to stay with the product and brand?\n\nJason: It\u2019s the quality, i have been approached to change many times over the years, but McCain has the superior quality that the others simply don\u2019t have. So based on that i choose to stay and sell McCain fries.",

        "text":"MEDIA email: \u00a0pr at\nAfter getting permission from YummyEarth to use one of our copyrighted images, please feel free to use any\nproduct image on our web site in your media story.\nRob Wunder: Green Willy Wonka\n\nHow can candy satisfy your kids' sweet tooth\u2014and your strict standards?\nRob Wunder, co-founder of Yummy Earth, tells us how.\n\nHow'd you become interested in candy making?\nMy friend Sergio was feeding rice pudding to my 15-month-old, Jonah, and we imagined that soon he'd begin asking\nfor candy. We dreamt aloud of inventing an organic lollipop that tasted so good our children would ask for it instead of\n'chemical candy'\u2014with all that artificial garbage. We spent months developing a recipe and perfecting the production\nprocess; two years later YummyEarth candies are selling out in\nthousands of stores nationwide and in 20 countries. Apparently, a few other parents also feel the same way!\n\nWhat's in your lollipops and candies?\nWanting the very best ingredients for our children, Jonah and Rose, Sergio and I chose organic. But we took it a step\nfurther, sourcing our ingredients from around the world to use which we feel are best in class. Citric acid made from\nIsraeli sugar beets instead of genetically modified corn; bright red coloring from purple carrots instead of artificial red\ndye; real pomegranate extract for our Pomegranate Pucker lollipops and candy drops. Organic pumpkin and black\ncurrant is also used to create the vibrant colors. We really have fun with the recipes and truly make the candy for our\nchildren and families first\u2014we aim to wow them.\n\nWhat does conventional candy contain that we might not be aware of\u2014what are we really feeding our kids?\nFood manufacturer executives are going to have to stand before Congress someday (like the big tobacco execs did) to\nexplain the thought process behind putting high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, artificial colors, artificial\nflavors, and other junk into their foods. Many of them label their products 'All Natural' because there is apparently no\nregulation preventing them! Parents haplessly put this stuff into their children's mouths all the time, so they're generally\nthrilled to find an alternative like ours that their kids truly love to eat.\n\nWhat sets your candy apart from the rest?\nTaste. People assume YummyEarth will taste like health food, but our tart, delicious flavors make them jump for joy.\nWe also have a huge allergy following. Families often struggle with allergy problems\u2014not being able to find treats that\nallow their kids to feel 'normal.' We hear that word a lot. It's uplifting to us when we hear that YummyEarth is usually the\nonly candy they can have\u2014whether it's an autistic child with a severely restricted diet or someone with intolerance to\ncorn, gluten, or artificial colors. Nothing gives us greater happiness than YummyEarth being their lollipop.\n\nAre your candies actually good for kids?\nFunny you should ask that. Our sour apple tart flavor is colored with wheat grass juice. We tested the lollipop for\nnutrients and found that the wheat grass juice nutrients survive the process (we stopped using this fabulous ingredient\nin October 2008 because it concerned gluten free people that were still concerned even after it tested as gluten free).\nSome of our lollipops will soon feature Organic Acerola Berries, a South American fruit rich in Vitamin C. But we're not\ntrying to be a health food, just a healthy alternative to what our kids want to eat: candy.\n\nHow do you come up with new flavors?\nWe listen to phone calls and email from kids, moms, and dads and try to make the flavors they want. We also try to\ncome up with unusual combos, such as Blood Orange Cocktail and Chili Mango Mambo.\n\nDid you experience any \"eco-conflicts\" in manufacturing?\nWe're not big fans of packaging, for example, we love selling bulk-size bags on because less packaging\nis consumed. But the reality we faced when offering YummyEarth in stores is that consumers aren't looking for a plain\nbrown sack of lollipops\u2014and stores won't put it on their shelves, either\u2014so we had to use something if we wanted to\nsell to more than just a few people at a farmer's market. Today all of our packaging is reusable or re-sealable. One\nchallenge we confronted was from our corn-sensitive fans, who have kept a steady drumbeat of requests against\nusing [biodegradable] corn-based wrappers. These would be more eco-friendly, but ours is the only candy they can eat\nbecause it contains no corn products. We chose them and their plight over using a corn-based wrapper. Not an easy\ndecision, but a personally rewarding one when we get their feedback.\n\nLooking at the runaway success of Yummy Earth, there seems to be a high demand for natural candies, yet there\nare relatively few on the market. Do you see the trend toward natural and organic sweets increasing in the near\nI do see a trend in that direction, but I see large corporations making only half-hearted attempts\u2014as their main goal is\nto make a label claim, not to actually use the best ingredients to produce something good for your family. In the natural\nfood world, it's always been a challenge to make healthy food taste great. I truly hope that our success can serve as a\nmodel for others to create delicious candy that you'll want first for its taste, not just because it's good for you.\n\nYou mentioned that these sweets are the only ones you could get \"mom approved\" for your kids. Are they allowed\nany other candies or chocolate?\nBoth my and Sergio's wives are pretty strict about what goes into our children's mouths\u2014as are many moms today. We\nreview ingredients\u2014they're allowed to eat our candy as well as organic chocolate we feel comfortable with. At first, it\nwasn't easy saying no, but they learned quickly. Jonah will ask, 'Is this made of garbage?' If we say 'Yes' he just puts it\nback and says, 'Yuck!' But I don't know how easy it would be if we had no delicious alternative for him.\n\nDo you and your family eat organic and natural foods?\nIt's not hard to eat organic or natural foods\u2014it's much more of a challenge to be a vegan or kosher. Most restaurants\nserve salads, steak, chicken, eggs, and cheese. It may not always be organic, but it's easy to avoid fast food and\nchemicals in your food at the supermarket or restaurants. It just takes a little extra effort and you get paid back in great\nhealth dividends.\n\nHave you and your wife ever had an eco-fight?\nMy wife and Sergio's wife went to Cornell University, located in the heart of the uncommonly green town of Ithaca, New\nYork. It's become one of my favorite places on earth. My wife has influenced me tremendously and I gladly lose every\neco-fight we have. Sergio grew up in Mexico City and loves the earth and trees and plants as his friends and extended\nfamily. He grows many fruits at his house and smiles most when under a tree with his family. They are both my\n\nWhat would you say is your biggest eco-chore?\nSeparating and managing recyclables. I've never been a fan of taking out the garbage, but today the process has been\nelevated to an art form!\n\nIs there any food you wish were green but isn't?\nI wish hot dogs in Central Park were made of something good.\n\nFROM 2007 and is accurate for claims and information as of 2007.\n\"the best lollipop\nI've ever tasted\"\nPhil Lempert - TODAY\nSHOW Food Editor\nemail us: \u00a0\nsupport @\nSergio and I, two dads with young children, founded YumEarth out of our commitment to feed our families a\ndiet rich in delicious honest foods.

        "text":"- First Drafts - http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer -\n\nSix questions with: Charlie Papazian, author and president of Brewers Association\n\nPosted By Jeremy Meyer On December 22, 2011 @ 6:00 am In Brewers,Colorado Beer,Homebrewing,Interviews | 1 Comment\n\nCharlie Papazian [1] is arguably the godfather of American homebrewing [2].\n\nThe Boulder resident in the early 1980s wrote the definitive homebrewing guide, The Complete Joy of Homebrewing [3], and added a fresh, chilled-out mantra for those attempting to brew: \u201cRelax. Don\u2019t Worry. Have a homebrew [4].\u201d\n\n[media-credit name=\u201dBrewers Association [5] \u201d align=\u201dalignright\u201d width=\u201d290\u2033] [6][\/media-credit]\n\nCharlie Papazian [7], president of the Brewers [8] Association and the godfather of homebrewing, answers six questions from First Drafts.\n\nPapazian also helped found the Association of Brewers [9] and the Great American Beer Festival [10], which is still the grandaddy of American beer festivals and still going strong after three decades.\n\nWe posed six questions to Papazian \u2014 a six pack \u2014 the second installment in what will be a regular feature on First Drafts. Read our exchange below, which, as always will be edited for space and clarity.\n\nQuestion: What are the best new trends in either home brewing or beer in general?\n\nAnswer: From a personal and selfish perspective, I\u2019m discovering more and more breweries are offering beers that are 5.5 percent (alcohol by volume) or less that are full flavored. For me, I am able to enjoy a few beers rather than stick with one glass of high-octane beer and I am out. So I like that trend.\n\nQ: What beer do you like to make the most and why?\n\nA: To reiterate what I just said, I like real flavorful beers that are around 5 percent (ABV) or less because I can enjoy them more frequently that are both refreshing and full of flavor \u2014 a German-style Helles, ordinary English-style ales. I have a Vienna mild that combines an English mild, which is low alcohol, and a Vienna lager. That\u2019s what I always have, two or three kegs of low-alcohol beers. I do like the occasional strong beer, but I reserve those for the fourth quarter of a Broncos game.\n\nQ: The Great American Beer Festival [11] has grown every year. Do you see any big changes in store, or what can be changed?\n\nA: It has grown moderately over the years with the number of people attending, and that is not our goal. Our goal is to grow the quality. It\u2019s been going on for 30-plus years, and you can\u2019t have a successful event unless it evolves with the times and circumstances and technology. We are going to continue to enhance the value of the beer festival for everyone. Sure, we could talk about doubling the hall space and having twice as many people there, but would that enhance the experience? That\u2019s a debate we continue to have. I think we are at a good space now.\n\nQ: Why has Colorado become such a big player in the beer culture?\n\nA: Why Colorado? The grassroots of three decades ago (when the GABF [12] started) established some very strong roots that are very sustainable. You have the original brewpubs and craft brewers that started in the 1980s and \u201970s, like Boulder Beer [13], and they are still around. There are 130-plus small breweries in Colorado and we have a population of 4 million now. That\u2019s a pretty darned good brewery to population ratio. I don\u2019t see that as oversaturation.\n\nQ: Best advice for a newbie homebrewer and not your famous catch phrase?\n\nA: If anybody has reservations, sit down and have a beer and relax and just do it. Just brew it. There is for sure another homebrewer in your neighborhood nearby. And if not there will be a homebrew club nearby. Get online to www.homebrewersassociation.org [14] and go to the club directory and find a homebrew club. Take a visit. Experience the fun and get exposed to the beer people are making. Just make your first batch. People are always extraordinarily surprised at how successful they are. That\u2019s why there are so many homebrewers. It\u2019s an easy do. And you rewarded pretty darned quickly.\n\nQ: What are you most proud of about your book?\n\nA: People are always coming up to me and saying the book has really changed their perspective on beer and even their outlook on life. One of the things that I am finally realizing, there are 1.2 million copies of that book out there. And I estimate that 95 percent of the nearly 2,000 small brewers in this country have their roots in homebrewing. Many of them come up to me and say they wouldn\u2019t be in business today without my book. And I am thinking, \u2018God, that\u2019s like $3 billion worth of employment.\u2019 Never mind the beer sales. There are hundreds of thousands of jobs created by the grass roots movement of homebrewing, and my book is definitely part of it. People from all walks of life have made a switch or embraced craft beer [15], and small businesses are buying equipment from other small businesses. I am kind of proud that that little book has had an economic impact that no one has quite really realized. I had two or three beers the other night and had time to reflect and I said, \u2018Wow. I like to see those bubbles keep rising.\u2019\n\nArticle printed from First Drafts: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\n\nURL to article: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/2011\/12\/22\/six-questions-with-charlie-papazian-author-and-president-of-brewers-association\/937\/\n\nURLs in this post:\n\n[1] Papazian: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/tag\/papazian\/\n\n[2] homebrewing: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/tag\/homebrewing-2\/\n\n[3] The Complete Joy of Homebrewing: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Complete-Homebrewing-Third-Harperresource-Book\/dp\/0060531053\n\n[4] homebrew: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/tag\/homebrew\/\n\n[5] Brewers Association: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/tag\/brewers-association\/\n\n[6] Image: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/2011\/12\/22\/six-questions-with-charlie-papazian-author-and-president-of-brewers-association\/937\/papazian_charlie\/\n\n[7] Charlie Papazian: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/tag\/charlie-papazian\/\n\n[8] Brewers: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/tag\/brewers\/\n\n[9] Association of Brewers: http:\/\/www.brewersassociation.org\/\n\n[10] Great American Beer Festival: http:\/\/www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com\/\n\n[11] Great American Beer Festival: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/tag\/great-american-beer-festival\/\n\n[12] GABF: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/tag\/gabf\/\n\n[13] Boulder Beer: http:\/\/www.boulderbeer.com\/\n\n[14] www.homebrewersassociation.org: http:\/\/www.homebrewersassociation.org\/\n\n[15] craft beer: http:\/\/blogs.denverpost.com\/beer\/tag\/craft-beer\/\n\nAll contents Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Denver Post or other copyright holders.

        "text":"\n\nI recently had the opportunity to interview Katrina Brink about Slow Food Tufts, the Tufts chapter of Slow Food USA housed in the Friedman School.\u00a0 For the past year, Katrina has been Chair of Slow Food Tufts, which was founded by Friedman students Asta Garmon and Jessica Lattif in 2009.\u00a0 Slow Food Tufts was born out of a Friedman student group called FOOD, which was dedicated to stimulating dialogue and action on the political, economic, cultural and environmental aspects of food.\u00a0 Slow Food Tufts continues to promote these same principles while growing in the Friedman community.\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is the primary mission of Slow Food Tufts?\u00a0\n\nThe mission of Slow Food Tufts is to gather folks around good, healthy food, to be conscious about what we are eating, to work to protect biodiversity in the food supply, and to question the social and economic structures that make up our food system.\n\nSimone Passarelli and Emily Wei making fresh pasta on Italian Night\nPhoto Credit: Katrina Brink\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In your opinion, what is the most impactful aspect of Slow Food? \u00a0\n\nI think it is the power of preparing a space for people to come around a table to share food together.\u00a0 Taking time to eat together allows for real conversations to happen and for all of us to slow down the hectic pace of our lives for a few minutes and talk to one another.\u00a0 At the international level, I think the most impactful aspect of Slow Food is its power to first gather people around good food, and then to rally them around the causes that are essential for us all to engage in every day in our communities and respective countries.\u00a0 It introduces people to the connections between what we eat and how those choices impact biodiversity, environmental sustainability and justice in the food system.\n\n\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I understand Slow Food Tufts is part of a national and international Slow Food organization and that you recently went to a Slow Food conference in Italy.\n\nSlow Food Tufts is a campus chapter under Slow Food USA.\u00a0 The chapter leaders are included in Slow Food USA leaders emails and phone calls, so you can give input and you get the inside scoop on what is happening in the organization.\u00a0 Since I was a leader this past year I was eligible to apply as a delegate for Terra Madre or the International Congress (hyperlink:, and I was selected to be part of the Congress. The purpose of the International Congress is to discuss and vote on a document called the Central Role of Food, as well as to elect the board for the next five years. \u00a0One of the most encouraging aspects of the conference was to see a strong, vibrant international youth presence in the form of the Slow Food Youth Network (SFYN). \u00a0I was happy to see that the focus of Slow Food has shifted to the importance of not only preserving food culture, but also restructuring our food system to be more sustainable and just. \u00a0Slow Food used to be seen as an organization for wealthy people of the Western world to enjoy expensive, gourmet food.\u00a0 But now there is an earnest effort underway to broaden the scope of the organization to address the injustices and unsustainability of our current agricultural and food manufacturing practices, and to include everyone in the movement.\n\nThis was the first year that the International Congress met at the same time as Terra Madre and the Salone Internazionale del Gusto (tasting salon) at the end of October in Turin, Italy.\u00a0 It was an incredible experience to be at this enormous event of some 200,000 people.\u00a0 Most were there for the tasting salon, which consisted of three rooms with hundreds of Italian farmers, chefs, and artisan food makers, and one huge room for the international tasting salon with representatives from nearly 100 countries.\u00a0 It felt like taking a tour of the world in one room.\u00a0 My eyes were opened to an astonishing number of new foods and products from around the world.\u00a0 It was great to meet people from all these different countries and taste the products they had so caringly made.\n\nAttendees of the Salone del Gusto could also attend the panel discussions and lectures that were a part of the Terra Madre component of the event.\u00a0 This event happens every two years as a way to bring together people from around the world who work in all aspects of the food system to discuss the environmental, social and economic issues tied to food and agriculture.\u00a0 There were talks ranging from how to green the economy to school gardening initiatives, as well as how to reduce food waste, what policies would be good to promote youth agriculture, and how to best support small scale fisheries.\n\nI would like to bring a lot more of the environmental activism and social justice aspect of the movement into what we do in Slow Food Tufts.\u00a0 It would be great for us to be involved in a community project in some way, and to see how we can be more actively involved in creating the food system we envision.\u00a0 I look forward to seeing where the new officers take the group in the coming year.\n\nFall apple picking\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What recent events has Slow Food Tufts held?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0This semester we went apple picking to benefit The Food Project (hyperlink:, and got to bring home lots of perfectly good apples that had fallen from the trees.\u00a0 A couple of us did two Saturdays in a row of canning apple chutney, spiced apples and apple butter.\u00a0\u00a0 After that we had a newfound respect for people who have to can all of their food.\n\nWe also went on our second annual tour of the cheese caves of Formaggio Kitchen ( in Cambridge this fall.\u00a0 In October we held Squash Fest, which was a delicious dinner of squash-themed foods, and most recently we had an Italian night and ate fabulous, homemade pasta and the best Eggplant Parmesan of our lives!\n\nYogurt-making skill share\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I hear there\u2019s a Bake-Off in the near future.

        "text":"In the kitchen with\u00a0Callum Hann\n\nMasterChef 2010 runner-up Callum Hann, 24, was raised in South Australia's Barossa Valley, a region famous for its premium wines and fabulous food.\n\nCallum Hann became a household name after finishing runner-up on the hit television series MasterChef two years ago.\n\nCallum Hann became a household name after finishing runner-up on the hit television series MasterChef two years ago.\n\nHann has joined ConnectPink, Fairfax Regional Media's online website for women, as a foodie blogger and is keen to share his passion and his recipes.\n\nWhat types of recipes and words of wisdom do you hope to share?\n\nI love to cook simple, seasonal food which still has a wow factor. I would love [readers] to try something new and maybe learn a few more techniques. There is no place in my life for hiding recipes or having kitchen secrets; for me food is there to be shared.\n\nWhat's your favourite dish?\n\nMy favourite dish is constantly changing; I get a bit bored if I cook the same things too often. My girlfriend Chloe and I have just expanded our veggie garden, so I am getting stuck into lots of fresh salads at the moment.\n\nWhat are your tips for creating healthy meals on a budget?\n\nI think the key is organisation. Try to plan a week's worth of meals and do one big shop, which saves you so much time and money in the long run. It also allows you to take advantage of leftovers and freeze future meals.\n\nHow do you suggest new cooks ease their way into the kitchen?\n\nI think the best thing to do is just get stuck into it. If the worst thing that happens to you in your day is you burn a couple of steaks, I think that's still a pretty good day.\n\nWho influences your cooking?\n\nJamie Oliver has been my biggest cooking inspiration since I was a child. I'm lucky enough to now be the Australian ambassador for Jamie's Home Cooking Skills.\n\nWhat ingredients can't you live without?\n\nGarlic, spices, herbs, condiments, good quality olive oil and lemons. The little heroes that make all the difference in a plate of food.\n\nWhere is your favourite place to eat out?\n\nIt sounds a bit corny, but Chloe's mum cooks a mighty fine roast dinner. She is one of those people where you don't ask for second helpings, she makes you have second helpings. Not that I'm complaining.\n\nWhat's growing in your garden?\n\nAt the moment there are leeks, garlic, beetroot, chard, chillies, capsicum, tomatoes, peas, snow peas, strawberries, lemons and a whole array of herbs.\n\nWhy is it important to taste food during the cooking process?\n\nIf you follow a recipe exactly you will end up with it tasting exactly how the author of that recipe wants it to taste. We all have different tastes, so constantly tasting and adjusting is vital. If I say \"juice of a lemon\" in a recipe, all lemons are different sizes right?\n\nHas travelling overseas influenced your recipe choices?\n\nDefinitely, I have expanded my horizons by seeing not only what other countries eat, but how they eat it. I love tasting a new dish, and thinking about how I can recreate it in my own kitchen.\n\nIs there one dish you just cannot master?\n\nNo matter how many times I try to make my mum's chocolate torte, it never seems to taste quite as good as hers.\n\nSample Hann's culinary style at, where he's kicking off with a delicious recipe for Vietnamese chicken with green mango salad.",

        "text":"How Does Greek Yogurt Compare to Regular Yogurt?\n\nRead Transcript\n\nI'm a huge fan of Greek yogurt and I say that's one of the most common questions I get asked. Greek yogurt actually uses three times the milk of regular yogurt, and if it is authenticly strange, it takes a couple of days where they let the way the liquid portion drain out, and what leaves you with is this rich and creamy yogurt that's almost take into the sour cream in terms of the mouth feel but it actually can have zero fat.\n\nSo Greek yogurt is a wonderful tool you can use if you want that rich creamy taste but none of the added fat. Greek yogurt is also because of using three times the milk twice as high in protein as regular yogurt. So for people who are looking for maybe a high protein snack that's still within a good calorie count Greek yogurt is fabulous, and lastly Greek yogurt is much lower because of all that straining it tends to be much lower in lactose.\n\nSo I have found with my clients who are lactose intolerant, Greek yogurt might be the one thing they can eat that actually agrees with them beautifully because most of the lactose is gone.",

These days I am keeping to my Italian roots and having an Espresso most of the time\u2026 however I still get the odd piccolo or Long black every now and then \ud83d\ude09\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to answer a few questions. In between reading and blogging I try to balance eating right and staying physically fit. When I saw your YouTube video I was hooked. How often can we expect to see those fabulous videos? No problem at all mate\u2026 I am here to make a positive impact on this world, so I am honored you want to hear my tasty thoughts :). Haha Love that the channel is keeping you intrigued. At this stage we are releasing one new episode of tasty awesomeness a week. But, coming soon we have a heap of content, particularly from the US to be getting through. Soooo, you may be seeing my head pop up on your lap top a little more often\u2026 quite frankly I feel sorry for my editor :).\n\nAs a book reviewer and blogger It\u2019s great to read about sexy alpha males. But having a sexy guy have the \u201ctools\u201d to cook in the kitchen, is even better! I\u2019m sure this book will be a welcome addition in many homes soon! I love how pure and simple your recipes are to prepare and make, they are fabulous! I LOVE the idea of creating a resourceful book to help those \u201cdudes\u201d out there figure out their way around in the kitchen.\n\nWhat inspires you to create these fabulous recipes? Haha thanks mate that\u2019s just it\u2026 I wanted to create a book that was not intimidating and more so inspiring and realistic for any person to pick it up and be like \u201cthat looks kick arse!! And I reckon I could do it!\u201d I get so much happiness seeing the response of people\u2019s tweets and Instagram posts stating how happy they or their stomachs are\u2026 and at the end of the day that is a big motivator for me to keep me doing what I am doing. I am trying to make people realize the simplicity of cooking, and the benefits of making a meal for your loved ones. I am not here to be known as a profile or be famous\u2026 I just want to make people happy and food is my tool to achieving that.\n\nIs there an ingredient that\u2019s a must? Asking me what a must ingredient is, is like asking me to pick my favorite family member. They are all so awesome and have so much color and epic presence and all have their own purpose in life. Yeah I went there. What I will say is right now I am cooking with plenty of sweet potato and that I always season with lemon juice. In fact for the sake of it lets go with a lemon\u2026 these days everyone gets caught up in salt, which is very appropriate, however they neglect the presence of acidity and there is nothing than the super sexy lemon :).\n\nIs there something you\u2019ve yet to include in a recipe that you\u2019re too afraid to use? I don\u2019t think I ever avoid ingredients. I am more so intrigued by ones I am unaware of or are unfamiliar with using. If I\u00a0walk past\u00a0a stall at a market with something I have never seen before, I do research on it to find out where it\u2019s from, moisture content etc.\n\nCongrats on your upcoming release of DUDE FOOD: A Guy\u2019s Guide to Cooking Kick-Ass Food in the US this past Tuesday,\u00a0April 21st!\n\nThanks again for hanging out! My absolute pleasure mate\u2026 thanks for all the love, and looking forward to cooking my way through the homes of America :).\n\nDan is touring across America \u2013 check him out if you\u2019re in the following cities:\n\nNew Brunswick \/ Rutgers 4\/23\nBoston \/ Northeastern 4\/27\nChicago \/ De Paul 4\/29\nCleveland \/ Case Western 4\/30\n\n8 Tantalizing Tidbits:\n\n1. What is a must read book and why? Should I be saying Dudefood, because it will bring forth an excitement and wicked tastiness like nothing you have ever experienced??? Hahah Na, I would have to say \u201cThe Art of Stillness\u201d by Pico Lyer. It helps people look at the big picture\u2026 Its actually part of the TED talk book range by Simon & Schuster. I was able to read it on a flight from Sydney to Melbourne and it provided an amazing outlook on life.\n\n2. What is one place that I should see if I visit your hometown? I can\u2019t go passed saying Narrabeen Beach\u2026 particularly in the morning. Watching those waves come in as the sun rises is one of the most amazing things I will ever see. I recently did a YouTube video making a pretty bad ass Chai porridge (stay tuned) and it was one of the most amazing things I have seen\u2026 cooking there was epic.. plus you can grab a coffee a great place around the corner and it is the aspect of Australia everyone knows and loves without the aspect of a known tourist attraction :).\n\n3. Castles or Beaches? That\u2019s an easy one, Beaches.\n\n4. One thing readers would be surprised to know about you? I have done a 20 minute plank\/prone hold.\n\n5. If you had an all expenses paid trip anywhere in the world for research, where would you go? All expenses paid trip\u2026 Italy\u2026 anywhere. I love the culture, food, architecture and way of life\u2026 plus the language is sooo awesome!!\n\n6. What\u2019s your favorite TV show? A toss up between Entourage and anything with Jamie Oliver in it \u2013 hahah.\n\n7. What\u2019s one thing you can\u2019t live without? One thing I can\u2019t live without\u2026 well I know its a necessity to survive, but I can\u2019t go passed food. I seriously plan my life around it.. to the point that I can get very #Hangry if I miss out\u2026 I actually get up excited to eat and as soon as finish my meal I am already planning my next hahah.\n\n8. If you could invite 5 people to dinner (not friends and family \u2013 that\u2019s too easy) who would you invite? It could be anyone past or present. Well you said no family and friends so obviously I can\u2019t go passed saying mum, but I get off the hook on that one\u2026 I am going to say Jamie Oliver, Tom Brady (who will obviously bring his lovely wife), Barney Stinson (the character for sure), Taylor Swift (She just seems like some serious wicked fun and Ryan Reynolds\u2026 I think he is a legend.\n\nCheers legend.. thanks heaps for sorting this out :).\n\n\u00a0Author Info:\n\nsmallDanChurchill_credit Isabelle Selby\n\nDan Churchill is a cook, physical trainer, speaker, and the author of the DudeFood cookbook.

Thus being a former reality lifestyle\u00a0show contestant who continued on an ascending career as the first ever Australian MasterChef winner.\n\nNo looking back since that honour with multiple books, endless magazine columns and now an in-demand cooking school \u2013 all while juggling a family.\u00a0Her new book is a simple \u2018Essential Cookbook\u2019 of recipes (out now through Hachette Publishing). It teaches one to boil an egg \u2013 yes, boil an egg!\n\nYou are one of the few reality show\u00a0contestants or personalities that has had longevity after the show ends. What is the secret of your success since winning in 2009?\n\nJulie Goodwin \u2013 Gosh, I can only do what I do with the people around me: family and the people who help me organise my calendar, everyone of my colleagues or publicists\u00a0including the staff in my cooking school.\u00a0\n\nGoing back to when you first applied for MasterChef,\u00a0what are the memories of that and then going on to winning it?\n\nJulie \u2013 I had been watching the UK version which was civilised and so British (laughs). But I truly didn\u2019t know what it was going to involve, especially as I had three small children and a family business. If I had\u2019ve known I had to live out of home for months, it might not have happened but kind of glad I did apply now (laughs). It was an incredible intense scary experience. Fun and inspiring and rewarding, all at once. To win was an enourmous privilege that came with great opportunities and experiences, just fantastic for the whole family.\n\nYour new book is the Essential Cookbook with go-to recipes. What are a couple of your favourites featured?\n\nJulie \u2013 If talking about easiness, it starts with the basic building blocks of cooking from scrambling or\u00a0boiling an egg, all that kind of stuff. Highlighting different cuts of meat for different purposes, my favourite things in any of my books are the things you put all ingredients into a pot, put it on the table for all to share. Things like Osso Buco or Apricot Chicken Tagine, big hearty family food.\u00a0\n\nAre you telling me there are people who cannot boil an egg?\n\nJulie \u2013 Yes totally! Absolutely there is. If you can\u2019t cook at all, this book is the perfect go-to. Even if you can cook, there are some really great ideas in there that are family and friends-approved.\u00a0\n\nDo your family ever cook for you?\n\nJulie \u2013 Indeed, life is busy so my husband and sons pitch in. As a basic life skill, I think people really should teach children how to cook.\u00a0\n\nIn your opinion, are you happy that many fast-food establishments provide so-called healthier options?\n\nJulie \u2013 It\u2019s a little bit tricky because they offer the healthy options to look good but how many people truly walk into a fast-food outlet and order the salad? You still go in and order the burger, right. Healthy food doesn\u2019t have to be boring. If you\u2019re cooking from scratch, you can make the adjustment you need to make for your own health requirements or taste. Nothing wrong with a hamburger you make at home with lean meat, fresh vegetables or salads. You decide not to put on four pieces of bacon, eggs, a block of cheese. It\u2019s about making your own decisions knowing what you\u2019re eating. Some places have \u2018make your own\u2019, that\u2019s different but generally, fast-food outlets have offset healthy ingredients with unseen unhealthy-like sauces or dressings. Healthy food is food that allows you to make your own choice. \u00a0\n\nTell me a little bit about your popular\u00a0cooking school.\n\nJulie \u2013 It\u2019s called Julie\u2019s Place in North Gosford and we run recreational classes on a variety of dishes. Recently we did a French Feast with, among other things, how to create a\u00a0souffle, then we sat down and enjoyed it all with a glass of French champagne or wine. We do corporate events or function catering. Upcoming classes include Indian Feast and Thai Feast, it\u2019s a pleasure to teach one and all.\n\nHow many shots did you pose for to create the glorious\u00a0cover of your new book?\n\nJulie \u2013 (laughs) I so\u00a0didn\u2019t want to be on the cover and almost refused to do it for the\u00a0publishers saying it\u2019s not important me appearing. (They) agreed but on the last day food photo shoot, I turn up alongside hair and make-up ready to go. They tricked me and took one with me and a Victoria\u00a0Sponge and another with me and a Roast Chook, the Sponge won (Laughs).\n\nDo you ever run out of recipes for new books?\n\nJulie \u2013 Everywhere I look, everywhere I go, everything I eat provides inspiration for new ideas. Honestly, I don\u2019t know as the world is a big place \u2013 lots of cuisines I\u2019ve never tasted or cooked. You know I haven\u2019t looked much into Polish food so that is definitely on my radar. Also Scandinavian too after having fish with a friend once, it was really interesting and different to what we have here.\u00a0\n\nWhen you eat other people\u2019s food, do you secretly rate them or yell out an open opinion?\n\nJulie \u2013 (laughs) No, how rude would that be. If somebody goes to the trouble to\u00a0cook for me, I\u2019m extremely grateful and blessed.\u00a0\n\nHave you ever thought about Julie\u2019s Food Truck?\n\nJulie \u2013 You read my mind Shane.\u00a0Certainly, we would love to bring the food to the people in a fun way, only if I had time time between radio, writing for Women\u2019s Weekly or creating cook books and the school. Maybe one day.\n\nWith an abundance of cooking related books around, what is it about yours that stands out?\n\nJulie \u2013 In all my books, the commitment is to have success with the recipes, easy to find ingredients, understanding the method. If you follow the steps, you will get the food you\u2019re looking for. Cooking or recipe writing\u00a0is a trust thing \u2013 going to great lengths that mine work and they\u2019re described in a way that\u2019s easy to understand. Sometimes I\u2019ll get my sons to cook from a recipe I\u2019m writing and the questions they ask me through the process indicate to me I have left nothing out.\n\n\u2018Julie Goodwin\u2019s Essential Cookbook\u2019 is available\u00a0now through\u00a0HACHETTE Publishing.\n\nShane A.

        "text":"Foodstuffs: Sweet French Pastries From A Registered Dietitian\n\nNov 13, 2014\n\nFrench macarons are meringue cookies quite different from the very coconutty (but still awesome) American style macaroons.\nCredit Jocelyn & Cathy via Flickr\/CC -\n\nYankee Magazine recently released the winners of its 2014 Editors Choice Food Awards. One of the New Hampshire honorees caught our attention: Moochie\u2019s Macarons of Nashua.\n\nThese French meringue cookies have been winning fans in New Hampshire and Massachusetts in recent months. All Things Considered talked with the woman at the center of this sweet empire, Nina DiBona-Pauk.\n\nAnd just for the record, Moochie is\u2026\n\nMoochie is my Havenese dog.\n\nWhy macarons?\n\nIt started one night - my husband and I were planning a trip to Paris, and to convince him to sit down and actually plan our trip, I convinced him that I'd planned this whole French inspired meal, and it would be really fun. I got all these ingredients to make this, but what I couldn't find and what I really wanted was some French macaroons. I decided, these can't be these hard to make, I'll just make it myself.\n\nWhen we got back from our trip, after sampling a rainbow of colors and flavors of macarons all over Paris, I just kept folding and whipping and piping out these pastries, and the rest is history. The business has really spiraled from there, and it's been an adventure. I've loved every minute of it.\n\nYou mentioned that there\u2019s a large variety of flavors \u2013 which is not unusual when it comes to baked goods. But are there particular flavors that work really well as a French-style macaron?\n\nThe common fillings are generally ganaches, buttercreams and preserves - and you can imagine within those three categories there are an infinite number of possibilities. But I found with my macarons that people really love the more interesting flavors. One of the most popular ones I sell is lavender honey macarons, which take local honey from Epping, New Hampshire. And I'm always experimenting with new and interesting variations of all of the different buttercreams and ganaches.\n\nIt's interesting that you couldn't find these in New Hampshire, given how much Franco-American history we have here. It's fitting, in a way, that you're bringing them back.\n\nIt is. It was about three or four years ago, and I've noticed now that they've really taken on in the US. Back then when I called these stores, they didn't even understand what I was asking for. They all thought they were the coconut balls that people think of, the American macaroon. But now they're in magazines, there on TV shows, they're really gaining popularity in America.\n\nYou're a registered dietitian. People must feel like, oh, I can have a couple of these.\n\nYeah, people think it's really funny that I'm a registered dietitian and went into a French pastry business. But in truth, they're actually not terrible for you. They're naturally gluten free - I also have some dairy-free flavors as well - and they're quite petite, so one or two of them is a fraction of the calories that a cupcake would have, or something of that nature. It allows for nice portion control.\n\nAnd the French macaron is really meant to be savored. It's something that you can sit, eat, savor and enjoy. So I don't feel bad being a dietitian and selling French pastries.",
