Abstract\n\nRural roadway safety is an important issue for communities throughout the country and presents a challenge for state, local, and Tribal agencies. The Improving Safety on Rural Local and Tribal Roads\u00a0\u2013 Safety Toolkit was created to help rural local and Tribal roadway safety practitioners address these challenges. The Safety Toolkit provides a step-by-step process to assist local agency and Tribal practitioners in completing traffic safety analyses, identify safety issues, countermeasures to address them, and an implementation process. Each step in the Toolkit contains a set of tools, examples, and links to resources appropriate to the needs of safety practitioners. The report presents a seven-step safety analysis process based on a similar process developed in the Highway Safety Manual. The seven steps are: compile data; conduct network screening; select sites for investigation; diagnose site conditions and identify countermeasures; prioritize countermeasures for implementation; implement countermeasures; and evaluate effectiveness of implemented countermeasures. Accompanying the Safety Toolkit are two User Guides (FHWA-SA-14-073 and FHWA-SA-14-074) which present step-by-step processes of example scenarios.\n17.

Diagnostics of malfunctions\n\nBefore starting repair of coupling, a transmission or corresponding drives of management (except cases of obvious breakages), it is necessary to analyse attentively available signs of malfunctions and their possible reasons. Often external sign of malfunctions of coupling and a mechanical transmission is the complicated gear change (the big efforts to the switching lever, shock inclusion of transfers or a gnash gear \u043c\u0443\u0444\u0442) or self-deenergizing of transfers.

        "text":"Original posted by Pete Snyders \u2013 Source\n\nA door is only as good as it\u2019s lock\n\nStrike plates or door strikes are the protective metal plates installed in the door jam that receives the latch or lock tongue when the door is closed. The ones in issue are the dove tail striker plates incorporating an aggressive toothed pattern on the bottom of the plate. This type is used on the Anglia 105E\/123E, Consul, Zephyr, Zodiac and more. As English Fords from the 50\u2019s\/60\u2019s continue to age, I\u2019m seeing striker plate teeth wearing to a point of safety concern. In those conditions the door needs to be slammed hard to close properly. In that case a new replacement is necessary. I\u2019ve contacted many sources regarding the availability for new plates with no avail. So I decided to give it a try and repair the most promising plates.\n\nNote: To start with, door latches need to be in good condition.\n\nFigure 1 and 3 plates are in good enough condition for repair. Figure 2 cannot be used for this type of repair. These are worn beyond a point of safety and the door will be in danger of flying open whilst the car is being driven at speed.\n\nI\u2019ve had success with using J-B weld epoxy. After rough sanding the worn area apply epoxy to plates to Fig 1 and Fig 3. Fill the cavity over flush in Fig 6. After the epoxy is dry file down until flush Fig 7. The epoxy filling is still holding to the plate tooth pattern on my Anglia 124E after a few months with little wear showing at the same time preventing any further wear on the tooth pattern. The filing may one day fall off but I\u2019ll just re-apply a new batch.\n\nThe Anglia 105E\/123E sedan came with two styles of striker plates Fig 8: early type < 10\/1962 and Fig 3 later type > 10\/1962. Estate later > 6\/1963. Fig. 4 are the early types. The L\/H plate tooth pattern are solid while the R\/H has a hollow front tooth. Fig 5 is the later type all hollow tooth. Be aware of these hollow tooth plates esp. if worn completely through the casting. REPLACE THEM.\n\nFig 8 are restored early type striker plates with new bumper rubber. Be sure that the door lock striker safety plate is installed p\/n: E2093-AA-1 on both early and later striker plates.",

The Liewneuatzs was capable of descending to and ascending from a planetary surface. The shuttles also saw use as high speed couriers due to their speed and maneuverability.\n\nThe shuttle was of very simple construction. The main hull was rectangular, with four main engines in the back, two more engines underneath the hull in the sponsons. Two more engines, used almost exclusively for orbital ascends, were placed in the upper rear of the shuttle. Numerous attitude and maneuvering thrusters were located over the hull of the craft, with two main braking engines in the extreme nose. Five reaction mass tanks were mounted partially externally on the rear half of the hull. The propulsion installation also included an anti-gravity pods, making the Liewneuatzs capable of unlimited hovering and slow ascends without using significant quantities of reaction mass.\n\nSee additional design notes.\n\nReturn to Zentraedi auxiliary Aircraft Index.\n\nGo to Robotech Reference Guide Home Page.\n\nRobotech (R) is the property of Harmony Gold.

Project Initiation Document\n\nB. Develop Initial Alternatives (150.10) - Develop Concept Alternatives (WBS 150.10.15)\n\nP53. Request COZEEP Estimate\n\nThe Construction Zone Enhanced Enforcement Program (COZEEP) is a Statewide Interagency Agreement (contract) between Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol (CHP). It enables the Department to hire CHP officers and vehicles to patrol project construction zones. A PowerPoint presentation and the COZEEP Procedures guidance information for Resident Engineers may be found on the Headquarters Construction Program Intranet website.\n\nCOZEEP should be used to increase traffic enforcement above normal levels in situations where traffic problems are anticipated, to reduce the potential for traffic accidents within a construction zone, and to reduce traffic speeds to the posted speed limits. CHP Officers may be used to slow down or assist in stopping or directing traffic to enable necessary breaks in traffic for critical movements of the Contractor\u2019s equipment and operations. During the erection or removal of bridge falsework over traffic lanes, or when traffic will be switched onto a detoured route are examples of when CHP Officers may be used to help control traffic.\n\nThe project engineer shall make an assessment of the need for COZEEP on every project that requires the contractor to close traffic lanes using cones or other channelizing devices and provide COZEEP for the following situations on freeways and expressways:\n\n  \u2022 All daytime or nighttime temporary closures of ALL lanes in the same direction of travel (Full Freeway Closures).\n  \u2022 Nighttime closures of two or more lanes on a freeway with three or more lanes of travel in the same direction.\n\nAll other closures shall be considered on a project specific basis. In general COZEEP is not necessary when only one lane is closed on freeways with four or more lanes in the same direction of travel.\n\nOther \u201crisk factors\u201d that would indicate to the project engineer the possible need for COZEEP are listed in Chapter 2-215A (9) of the Construction Manual. This assessment shall be reviewed as part of the Project\u2019s Safety Review and\/or Constructability Review and may become part of the project\u2019s Transportation Management Plan (TMP) and TMP estimate. The project engineer may specify specific construction operations where the use of COZEEP is mandatory.\n\nThe project engineer is also responsible to ensure that adequate COZEEP funds are included in the PID, and later in the project\u2019s PS&E estimate as State Furnished Material. The design assumptions and estimate calculations should be included in the Resident Engineer\u2019s pending file. The COZEEP cost estimate shall be based on the expected number of occurrences of the events needing COZEEP that have been identified. This should include an estimated number of COZEEP service hours that are then converted into a dollar cost. Contact the District COZEEP Coordinator for current costs. The project engineer may obtain assistance concerning COZEEP by contacting the District Traffic Operations Branch, the District Traffic Manager, the designated District COZEEP Coordinator within the Construction Division, or the Headquarter COZEEP Program Coordinator.\n\nWhen estimating COZEEP hours, the CHP operating policies must be taken into account.\n\n  \u2022 CHP policy requires that between the hours of 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM there must be two officers in each CHP vehicle. (One CHP officer per vehicle is acceptable if a second officer and vehicle is also utilized in the near vicinity.)\n  \u2022 The CHP Memorandum of Understanding requires a minimum payment of four hours per officer.\n  \u2022 All times and mileage times are based on the Officer starting and stopping the detail at his\/her regular duty station and must include travel to and from the project. The COZEEP Coordinator will provide current hourly costs for the project location, which shall include an allowance for mileage.\n\n\nConstruction Manual, (Chapter 2-215,\u201cConstruction Zone Enhanced Enforcement Program\u201d)\n\n\nReturn to Table of Contents\n\nIf you have any questions about the Project Development Procedures Manual send e-mail\n\nThis page last updated October 20, 2010",
