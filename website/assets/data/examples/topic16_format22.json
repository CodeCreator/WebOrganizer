        "text":"Pin It\n\nBook Review Basic\n\n\nWith that, I find that it is important to compose publication evaluations as well, particularly if you have sturdy sensations for the book. If people didn\u2019t write publication evaluations, after that no one would know concerning the brand-new and outstanding books to strike the market and these skilled writers would certainly never ever come to be recognized or continue their journey of composing impressive books. The concept of composing a real publication assessment might appear challenging to lots of for you do not already know where to start.\n\nStep one of composing a review, is pick out that publication that you have been dying to check out. If you currently have the desire to check out a specific book, your feelings and assumptions of the book will be much more determined, making it all the simpler to put into words and compose a testimonial. If you have no idea where to begin, trying going to your preferred book part, young adult for me, and have a look around. Choose something that interest rates you, however preferably, isn\u2019t everything extensively prominent. By picking a less become aware of publication, you won\u2019t be as most likely to let other\u2019s perspectives influence you throughout the evaluation procedure. Additionally, your assessment will most likely be more useful because there will not virtually be as many out that as the top sellers.\n\nThe upcoming part is the most simple. Since you have your publication, reviewed it. Attempt not to get also caught up in the truth that you will certainly soon be discussing this publications. Review it for pleasure. If you find yourself chuckling, sobbing, quivering, or numerous of the other emotions books could bring to us, create that page down. That part of the book clearly obtained a reaction from you, so you might wish to discuss it in the future in your review.\n\nOnce you have actually completed the publication, take a minute rest and really think about it. Think concerning your favored parts, your the very least beloved parts, and contrast just what you thought of this book to exactly what you have assumed of others. On the various other hand, if your cons exceed your pros, you most likely did not care for this publication at all.\n\nFrom this point, you already know exactly what you thought about guide that you merely check out. It goes to this factor that many individuals will rate guide on some kind of scale such as one to ten. This component is totally optional. If you locate that you can quickly pick a number to suit the publication, then I recommend you go on and do it. I, on the other hand, locate that choosing a number can be fairly tough, for all books are so different that I have a hard time classifying them under one number. Instead I opt to just create down a quite short phrase that summarizes my sensation for the publication, such as \u201cLiked it\u201d, \u201cNever mind\u201d, \u201cCouldn\u2019t Put it Down\u201d, and several others. By doing this, you are generally rating the book, however permitting your viewers to view it in a qualitative method.\n\nNext, you will begin the actual creating process. The first action is writing down all the important information about the book so that your audience will already know specifically what you are reading. During this component the even more details, the much better. The title of guide and the author have to be featured; however, you can feature various other information such as: cost, type of publication, subject, illustrations, and many others. You may include whatever you feel is essential to your evaluation.\n\nDuring the next component, you need to offer a summary over just what occurred in the book. This part can be complicated due to the fact that you desire your audience to know what the book is around, but you don\u2019t want to offer also a lot away or there will certainly be no point for them to read it. You could then go on to write about just what you believed were vital components of the book, but bear in mind not to offer away also considerably.\n\nIn the really tail end of the evaluation, you must give your viewpoints. Tell the readers just what you thought of the book and why. Now is an excellent time to detail several of your pros and cons that you formerly jotted down. When jotting down your ideas, bear in mind to be polite to the authors. You might not have taken care of guide, however somebody took a great deal of time composing it so never insult anybody and refrain from making use of vulgar language. When you are completed creating your ideas, look into your work and check for any sort of misspellings. If everything is in its correct spot, then you are done and have written your assessment!",

        "text":"Order Your Copy Now!\n\nTolkien's Middle-earth:\n\nLesson Plans for Secondary School Educators\n\nUnit Nine: \"The Quest Is Achieved\"\n\nDiscussion Topics\n\nThe Aret\u00e9 of Aragorn. Two of the Grimm Brothers' tales included in this course, \"The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs\" and \"The Water of Life,\" are quest adventures in which a hero, after overcoming obstacles and enduring hardships, wins both a kingdom and a fair maiden \u2014 which is what happens to Aragorn. Ask students to identify those aspects of Aragorn's heritage, character, and behavior that make him something more than a fairy tale hero. On what occasions does he exhibit aret\u00e9? When Aragorn catalogues Beregond's transgressions and then announces, \"For these things, of old, death was the penalty\" (page 947), did the class anticipate that the King's final verdict would be so just and noble?\n\nThe Tragedy of Frodo. Irreparably damaged by his decision to become a Ring-bearer, Frodo is eventually ennobled by his suffering, and so some critics have labeled him a tragic hero. Have the class chart the \"fall\" that Frodo endures over the course of the novel. How does this descent make him a better person? As the discussion progresses, you may want to juxtapose the Frodo who laments \"What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature\" (page 58) with the Frodo who responds to Saruman's knife attack by saying \"Do not kill him even now\" (page 996). How else did the Quest refine our hero? What do students make of his cryptic speech, \"It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them\" (page 1006)?\n\nThe Triumph of Sam. In his correspondence with a prospective editor, Tolkien called Sam \"the chief hero\" of the novel (Letter No. 131). Does the class agree with this judgment? As we reflect on the whole story, which of Sam's actions seem especially heroic? Some students may point to his battle with Shelob: \"As if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion, the glass blazed suddenly like a white torch\" (page 713). No less impressive is Sam's decision to continue the Quest alone after Frodo has apparently died (page 715). For many readers, Sam's finest hour occurs when he resists the temptation to put on the Ring and transform the vale of Gorgoroth into a lush kingdom: \"The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm\" (page 881).\n\n\"The Shadow Has Departed.\" Unit One invited students to consider Tolkien's notion of the eucatastrophe, the \"turn\" that delivers the fairy tale protagonist from disaster, bringing joy to hero and reader alike. Critics have noted three such \"positive reversals\" in Book Six: Gollum's attack on Frodo at the Cracks of Doom (pages 925), \u00c9owyn's realization that \"the Shadow has departed\" (page 943), and Aragorn's discovery of \"a scion of the Eldest of Trees\" (page 950). Have the class revisit these eucatastrophes. Which did students find the most moving? The most believable? In each case, what factors keep the reader from anticipating a joyous turn? How does Tolkien suggest that the \"miracle\" traces to something beyond blind chance?\n\nKnife, Sting, and Tooth. During the long course of the Quest, Frodo is variously assaulted by the Witch-king, Shelob, and Gollum. \"I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long burden,\" he tells Gandalf on page 967. \"Where shall I find rest?\" Have the class discuss Frodo's three wounds. Which hurt causes him the most anguish? Can any of these injuries compare with the psychic damage done by the Ring? Might we presume to map each wound onto one or more of Tolkien's themes: power, corruption, good, evil, freedom, destiny, despair, heroism, and so on?\n\n\"The Ring Is Mine!\" An especially dramatic moment occurs when Frodo, standing on the brink of the Cracks of Doom, renounces his mission: \"I do not choose now to do what I came to do,\" he says on page 924. \"I will not do this deed. The Ring is mine!\" What do students think is going on here? In declining to relinquish the Ring, is Frodo really making a free choice? Did this sudden betrayal of the Quest come as a surprise to students? Does it diminish Frodo's status as a hero, or does it actually enlarge his achievement?\n\nUnit Nine Content\n\nComments for Teachers\nPreliminary Quiz\nKey Terms\nDiscussion Topics\nSuggested Activities\n\nPrinter-Friendly Version Printer-Friendly Version",

In writing, one must have the skills to deliver and make the reader understand what is being communicated. A literary analysis essay is composed by combining various analysis paragraphs. An analysis paragraph should contain one or more components of the entire essay. This kind of writing requires one to have critical analysis skills and at the same maintain a clear organization of the paper. In order to maintain a good structure of in literary analysis essay, you need to identify your audience, the thesis statement of your work, and the aspect of the literature that needs to be written.\n\nIn another word, while writing an analysis, make sure that you are able to cover the topic fully. In addition, always let your essay have a central idea or thesis statement. A thesis statement is the main or central idea that governs each analysis paragraph written.\n\nThere is no single person on earth who was born with the knowledge of analyzing literature. Thus there is a need for each person to learn the tips and the requirements for conducting a critical literary analysis.

With as little as $13 per page, you get to acquire your own paper that has included everything according to the instructions and sometimes gives you questions that you should ask yourself if there is need to learn more. There are a few questions that should act as a guide when writing an analysis essay\n\n\u2022 The first step involves asking a series of questions that you would like your essay to address.\n\n\u2022 Once the questions are established, pick one that is more interesting and then collect sufficient evidence that will be used in the support of your response.\n\n\u2022 The next step involved in literary analysis is to construct a thesis statement based on the question and evidence prepared.\n\n\u2022 Another set is the development and organization of the argument. In any written analysis essay, the writer should have a specific point that is supported in the essay.\n\n\u2022 At this point, you need to write an introduction, body paragraphs, and the conclusion of your literary analysis.\n\nThe focus of each literary analysis is based on different elements of research that must be addressed to accomplish the expected outcomes. The student needs to address the seven important elements of literary analysis. The elements of literary analysis that must be addressed by the student are; the plot, setting, characterization, conflict, the point of view, tone, and theme.\n\nThe plot is an element of literary analysis that explains the flow of events that form the story. You need to state whether the plot adds any value or if it was significant to the claim raised in a literary analysis.\n\n\nConflict occurs when there are two opposing forces that struggle for attention in characters. For example, in most cases, there is the protagonist and antagonist. Conflict can be said to follow traditional forms and at times a character can experience conflict from within. Conflict arises from external forces or internal supernatural forces that affect the day to day activities of a person.\n\nCharacters and characterization\n\nCharacters are the people or things that are used by the author to elaborate the flow of the story. Characters in literary analysis form the main focus of the story in a given literary analysis. The way in which a character is developed from can be explained by their background, beliefs, and actions and other ways that can describe them forms the basis of analysis. A good analysis paragraph should explain and express opinion, race, culture, gender, among other descriptions that define the various characters. In addition, there are main characters and other characters in a story in the development of the story and gives the writers a way of analyzing the main points presented by the author of a given research.\n\n\nThe setting can also analyze the same way that the characters are analyzed. Setting explains the authors\u2019 point of view of their characters and the location where the story was set.\n\n\nThe tone of a story can also be examined by the student to explain the characters as well as the interaction between people and the environment. Tone in literary analysis shows the authors attitude towards the subject and characters or proceedings in the story. Once you understand the tone in a story, you have improved chances of becoming better in the construction of literary analysis paragraphs.\n\n\nOn the other hand, is conducted through the concept of thought or opinion that the author of a story expresses. The theme deals with the way that the main point of view of the author expresses. The theme is not used to describe itself, but it is used to explain how other aspects are addressed.\n\nPoint of view\n\nIn any literary analysis, the author always develops characters who get affiliated to a given point of a story. For example, during the conflict, the author can emphasize on a point they want to put more emphasis on regarding the setting of the story. When the main objective is to write an analysis essay, understanding the main point of view is very important in ensuring a perfect analysis.\n\nLiterary , the analysis is used in ensuring that the student understands and promotes critical thinking.

They serve as containers for ideas and help break up large chunks of text, making your content easier to read. But knowing how to write a good, well-structured paragraph can be little tricky.\nThere's no set length for a paragraph. However, it is possible to have your paragraphs too long or too short. Here are some tips that will help you to get your paragraphs right:\n\n1. Carefully construct your paragraphs - good writing starts with good structure. Create a logical structure that leads the reader directly to the conclusions you want them to reach.\n\n2. Begin with an introductory sentence - this sets out the subject of the paragraph. The remainder of the paragraph should go on to explain or 'unpack' the initial sentence.\n\n3. No superfluous stuff - if it's not directly related to your introductory sentence, delete it or move it to another paragraph.\n\n4. Keep one idea to one paragraph - if you begin with one idea, don't end with another or wander around different ideas.\n\n5. Split long paragraphs into shorter ones - it's perfectly acceptable to begin a paragraph with a sentence connecting it to the previous paragraph.\n\n6. Make your paragraph flow - fit sentences together in a way that's clear to your reader. Make them feel that they move easily from one sentence to the next, and that each coheres with the one before and after.\n\nWrite shorter paragraphs\n- this will increase the clarity of your writing. Making it more concise and your arguments is easier to follow.\n\n8. Clear, logical and easy to understand - by breaking your ideas down into bite-size chunks they're easier to understand.\n\n9. Opening paragraphs must grab attention - give a clear and concise reason why you are communicating and lead your reader on to wanting more.\n\n10. Closing paragraphs should finish strong - a call-to-action, summary or conclusion should be direct and to-the-point. Don't waffle or pussy-foot around. Ask.\n\n\"A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.\" - William Strunk, jnr.

        "text":"Working With Editors\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever read a book that was poorly formatted or littered with errors, then you understand the important role editors play in bringing quality books to readers. If you\u2019re a new writer who\u2019s never been edited, or an old pro who\u2019s been burned, you might be wary about letting an editor near your manuscript.\n\nBut if you\u2019re matched with the right editor, the editing process should actually be a relief, if not a joy. Finding the right editor is key, and it\u2019s just as important to cultivate a good working relationship.\n\nFind the Right Editor\n\nFirst, be aware of the different kinds of editing. If you aren\u2019t sure what editors do, or are confused by a lot of editing terms, have a look at the definitions page on the Editors Canada website. There are four stages of editing that a manuscript goes through when thoroughly edited. At the very least, you will need a structural edit and a copy edit.\n\nSecond, make sure you ask the right questions to find an editor familiar with your genre and who meshes well with your personality and is sensitive to your style preferences. Many editors specialize, so find one with a background in your subject. If anything in your initial contact with an editor makes you uncomfortable, find a different editor, because you need to trust your editor for the process to run smoothly. Don\u2019t forget to discuss style, because if, for example, you prefer the serial comma and your editor has a sparser punctuation style, it can easily lead to conflict.\n\nFinally, be aware of how a professional editor should conduct their business and what you should expect. Knowing what to expect can help you avoid amateurs and scammers. Anyone can call themselves an editor, but professionals will have training, regularly update their skills, belong to professional associations, and network with industry professionals. There are plenty of professional editors\u2019 associations, like CIEP, Editors Canada, EFA, ACES, and their websites will help you search for pros.\n\nCultivate a Good Relationship\n\nOnce you know what kind of editing you need and have found an editor you trust and who has the right qualifications, you still need to make sure you and the editor understand your roles. Be sure to have a contract that lays out expectations, payment and deadlines.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask questions about the editing process, no matter how foolish you think they are. You will feel more comfortable knowing when you will receive feedback, how changes will be reviewed, what kinds of changes to expect and what the schedule is.\n\nRemember that while good editors may seem super-human, they\u2019re not miracle workers. Mistakes happen, but remain professional and courteous. Stand up for your story when you disagree with your editor, but be willing to compromise.\n\nAs an editor as well as an author, I\u2019ve been on both sides of the desk and have had fantastic edits and horrific edits in both roles. I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s important to trust your instincts, be prepared, and remember that no edit is set in stone. A good edit by a good editor is rewarding and empowering, so it\u2019s worth the extra research and work to find and maintain a good match.\n\nOne thought on \u201cWorking With Editors\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

What heart in the assembly, especially what female heart, could remain unmoved when the voice came from those dreary subterranean caverns! and when the buried cried out against the wrongs imposed on my sex!\n\n11. There are, it is said, three millions of men constantly on the deep, as sailors, standing at the helm, working the pump, climbing the shrouds, wet and cold in the storm, cling-, ing to the wreck, going down to watery graves, \u2014 and for what? Why, that our dear ones may have their silks, their shawls, their laces, their china, and their perfumes!\n\n12. It is estimated that fifty thousand men, every year, are buried in the mighty deep. O woman, woman! What do you mean? Why are you not hanging on the swinging yards, climbing the mast, and facing these hardships and dangers? I do protest against the slavery to which you have sunk my kind!\n\n13. And the Convention should be electrified by the eloquence of men who fill our streets; who bear burdens; who carry all the brick and mortar to build the fine houses; who are obliged to handle pork and tobacco, train-oil and sugar, molasses and codfish; who are all day long confined in dusty, close counting-rooms, and exhausting life and strength over blotted account-books; who, in lonely church-yards, must dig graves, and work with no company save the moldering dead!\n\n14. Are we not compelled, early and late, to do the hardest, vilest, filthiest work that human beings ever performed? What a story of wrong could we not tell? When I come to your great city, I can't get a seat in the cars till the ladies are provided for, and that, too, next the window!\n\n15. I can't get a seat at the table, in the hotel or in the steam-boat, till the ladies are seated at the head of the table, where, I understand, t.he greatest delicacies are placed; and ii any body has to wait for the second table^ and eat fragments, it is not a lady. If a gentleman has a seat in the cars, and a lady comes in and wants it, though he were the king himself, he must give it up cheerfully.\n\n16. Ah! and who feeds the iron horse and makes the cars go? Who lights the street-lamps, brushes boots, colors your hats, and pounds down the stones in the street? O men, men! poor men! my soul yearns over you, and longs for your deliverance!\n\n17. Do you not se6 that it's the women who keep you down to these ignoble toils, and who snuff out the very light of your existence? Do you not see that, if they would only come and help us, and lift off our burden, we might be free?\n\n18. I used to think \u2014 foolish me! \u2014 I used to think that the Bible made us to be the protectors of women, and that thus the strong were to bear the infirmities of the weak, and that we could not fulfill the designs of Providence without doing all this hard drudgery, and exempting our feebler sisters from it. But since their famous Convention I have learned differently.\n\n19. I knew it was disagreeable to be surgeons, and to amputate arms and legs, and cut out tumors, and sew up wounds; but I had no idea that the ladies were longing to cut and saw too.\n\n20. I knew that our lawyers were a kind of civil police to keep the community quiet, and aided, as a chimney, to carry off the smoke of society; but I had no idea that our ladies were grieved that they were not chimneys too! In short, I see things in a new and strange light; and I am all awake for having a Men's Rights' Convention.\n\nQuestions. \u2014 What words in the first line of this exercise should be read with the circumflex?

Point out some examples which are not marked, and tell why they require the circumflex, &c, &c. What is said in the note of the Egyptian bondage here alluded to? What ami where is Maiden Lane? What do you think was the Mithor's most obvious design in writing this exercise?\n\n\n\nMonotone is a protracted sameness of sound on successive syllables or words.\n\nMonotone, as here used, does not mean a succession of sounds perfectly similar, but simply that a similarity of tone, with slight modifications, prevails throughout the sentence t>r piece to be read.\n\nRule 10. Language that is grave, grand, or sublime, generally requires the monotone.\n\n\n1. He prayed for his murderers: \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\"\n\n2. \"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power; for thou hast created all things; and for thy pleasure they are, and were created.\"\n\n3. Honest plain words best pierce the ear of Grief.\n\n4. Hail, sacred Peace, who claim'st thy bright abode \"Mid circling saints who grace the throne of God.\n\n\n\n[In reading this exercise, the attention of the class may be directed more especially to the examples of monotone.]\n\n1. About three weeks elapsed; and I again returned to visit the happy family, on the shore of this beautiful lake. My pulse beat high with expectation. My horse had not forgotten the' hospitality of the Burtons; and we rapidly approached these well-remembered scenes.\n\nQuestions. \u2014 What is monotone? Does it here mean a succession of sounds per, ectly similar? What is the rule for monotone? Read the examples.\n\n* Lake George, a beautiful lake lying mostly in Warren County, N. T.\n\n2. As I descended the last hill, and some time before I . reached the house, Rover, the large Newfoundland dog, came bounding along, with every demonstration of joy, to welcome^ my return. Upon entering the house, I was informed by the domestics, that the whole family were out enjoying an afternoon's sail.\n\n3. Taking Rover with me, I strayed down to the neighborhood of their landing-place, and seated myself on a cliffy which overlooked the lake. The waters of Lake George are peculiarly transparent. From a boat, I have often looked out upon its pebbly bed, and thought I might easily have waded to the shore, when, in truth, I could not reach the bottom with my oar.\n\n4. I sat wrapped in the dream of expectation, measuring the long ripple which the boat left upon the lake, and thinking whether the party could reach home before dusk. I turned toward the sun to judge from its height how many minutes the light of day had yet to live.\n\n5. I was immediately struck by the uncommon richness of the white, fleecy cloud, which was rolling itself, volume upon volume, into a thousand wild, fantastic shapes. At the same moment, a small black cloud seemed suddenly to grow out of the mountain.\n\n6. As it rose, it swelled and spread itself, like a pall, over the rich mass of vapors, effacing, one by one, the beauties of the gorgeous spectacle. The wind freshened from the east; but the thunder-cloud still steered against it, and sailed on in sullen majesty, like some dusky spirit, regardless, of the opposing element.\n\n7. The sun was obscured; and a cold shade was thrown over the lake. The leaves rustled through the forest with a noise like the long roll of the ocean on some distant beach; and a dull, low moaning seemed to move upon the waters.\n\n8. All nature portended one of those tremendous storms, which there, in seasons of the profoundest calm, pour in a moment out of the hollows of the surrounding mountains. I looked back anxiously for my friends. Their bark had neared the bay, and was gallantly cleaving the waves.\n\n9. I thought I could distinguish Arthur at the helm, proudly steering his little treasure, fearful only for those whom he loved dearer than life. I waved my handkerchief; and it was answered.\n\n10. The heavens were now completely overcast; the thunders rolled heavily, nearer and nearer; and big, round drops splashed, here and there, upon the water. Presently there was a blinding flash, and an explosion shaking the cliff to its very root.\n\n11. The long, broken peal which followed, reverberated from crag to crag, and died away in the far distance. There was a momentary pause; \u2014 the gates of heaven were loosed; and the water fell in sheets, as if another lake was emptying itself from the sky.\n\n12. I could just discern the little boat through the thick rain. In spite of the fury of the storm, it gained its way, and had already reached the entrance to its harbor. A few moments more, and it would be safe!\n\n13. While I was yet looking at it, a sudden gust of wind rushed out of the west. The boat stopped for an instant, as if fixed to the spot; and then, with a slight tremulous motion, settled into the waves!\n\n14. From a point below, Rover had sat watching its progress. He now set up a wild howl, and dashed into the water. I instinctively started up, ran down the cliff, leaping from point to point, \u2014 slipping among the rocks, \u2014 catching at the weeds and briers, which sprung out of the crevices; nor was it till I stood upon the very margin of the lake, that I reflected on the rashness of my design; for I was wholly unable to swim.\n\n15. Eover, however, bore out stoutly from the shore, and had almost reached the spot ; but no trace of the boat could be seen! The torrents of rain ceased; and I could now clearly descry a human figure, emerging from the waves. It\n\n\u00ab PreviousContinue \u00bb",

        "text":"Feet and Meter in Poetry\n\nWordsmith Essays promises you the best online essay editing.\u00a0 Our international team of editors can help you with all different kinds of writing, from creative stories to technical reports.\u00a0 Today, one of our editors talks about how to organize and structure poetry.\n\nToday, we\u2019re continuing our look at writing poetry with a review of a couple of the basic elements of English poetry. Of course, there are a wide variety of forms and conventions in English poetry\u2014from the Anacreontics to the villanelle\u2014but a handful of elements are almost always present, such as the line and the foot.\n\nThe line and the foot are two organizational principles in English poetry. The line is a collection of metrical units known as \u201cfeet\u201d and each foot is a grouping of stress and unstressed syllables organized in a repeating pattern. For example, consider the first line from one of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets:\n\nDevouring time, blunt thou the lion\u2019s paw.\n\nAs we learned last time, this line can be divided into a series of stressed and unstressed syllables:\n\nDevouring time, blunt thou the lion\u2019s paw.\n\nEach foot consists of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable, a type of foot called an \u201ciamb\u201d. The iamb is one of the most common of metrical feet, but there are others, including:\n\n\u2013 Trochee: a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable.\n\n\u2013 Spondee: two unstressed syllables.\n\n\u2013 Anapest: two unstressed syllables followed by a stressed syllable.\n\n\u2013 Dactyl: a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllable.\n\nThe number of feet in a line determines the type of meter. The line from Shakespeare\u2019s sonnet has five iambic feet, so it would be the most common metrical form: iambic pentameter. The types of meter can be broken down as:\n\n\u2013 Monometer: one foot.\n\n\u2013 Dimeter: two feet.\n\n\u2013 Trimeter: three feet.\n\n\u2013 Tetrameter: four feet.\n\n\u2013 Pentameter: five feet.\n\n\u2013 Hexameter: six feet.\n\n\u2013 Heptameter: seven feet.\n\n\u2013 Octometer: eight feet.\n\nAnd so on. The most common types in poetry are tetrameter, pentameter, and hexameter, but there are plenty of famous poems and poets that work with other types of meter.\n\nDifferent metrical lines provide different effects and a good poet trains themselves to know what tool is useful for what job. Iambic pentameter is closest to natural speech:\n\nI love to hear her speak, yet well I know\n\nThat music hath a far more pleasing sound\n\nWhile something like trochaic tetrameter is more lyrical and has an unnatural quality:\n\nTyger, Tyger, burning bright,\n\nin the forests of the night\n\nThe easiest way to learn the difference is to read a lot of poetry and experiment with different forms of meter. How does a poem sound in iambic tetrameter? Dactylic hexameter? By paying attention to the metrical structure, you\u2019ll be better equipped to express emotion and feeling through the structure of the poem as well as the content.\n\nThat\u2019s it for lines and feet. Next time, will be the final day of our look at poetry, where we\u2019ll be practicing some simple tricks and techniques for composing your own poetry.

        "text":"So you want to write a story, or even a book?\u00a0 Here are some tips I have found useful.\u00a0 Read them carefully and keep them in mind the next time you pick up a pen or pencil.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, you must have an Idea.\u00a0 Play around with that idea in your head for a while.\u00a0 The idea will become your controlling agent when you begin your writing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next, think about demographics.\u00a0 That is, who is your audience?\u00a0 Are they children, adults, ordinary folks\u2026or a more elite group?\u00a0 This will require a mastery of language.\u00a0 If you want to write, you are likely one who loves words.\u00a0 Be careful with them, though.\u00a0 You do not want to talk down to your audience, nor do you want to talk above their word comfort level.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who are you writing about?\u00a0 Your characters should be believable, even if they jetted in from Mars.\u00a0 Make their actions suit their character.\u00a0 Descriptions are good, even necessary, but actions are more important.\u00a0 Use plenty of action words\u2014verbs\u2013instead of adjectives.\u00a0 The reader understands your characters better when he sees them in action.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do you wrap up your story?\u00a0 A good way to do this is to imagine you have placed a gift in a box and now you must tie a ribbon around it.\u00a0 One end of the ribbon \u2013 the end \u2013 should connect with the other.\u00a0 This means that something in the beginning of your story is satisfactorily connected to the end of the story, thus tying it all together in a believable way.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, leave something for the reader to think about.\u00a0 Some of the best story writers create characters and situations which, though solved, leave enough on the plate that the reader finds himself yearning for more.\u00a0 That is the appeal of sequels or sagas.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I am engaged in a thoroughly satisfying book or short story, I find that I really don\u2019t want it to end.\u00a0 I have become so involved with the character that I want to see him or her continue those activities that have captivated my attention.\u00a0 When you can get that sort of relationship established between your character and the reader, you have really achieved something.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps then it is time to think about another chapter in the life of this marvelous creation, your character.\u00a0 Another book!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This last tip is perhaps the most important of all.\u00a0 An aspiring writer should be very well read.\u00a0 Books from all literary periods, books from a great variety of writers.\u00a0 When you are very well read, you are in a better position to know what is appealing in a book.\u00a0 Then, who knows?\u00a0 The next classic on the market may be something you have written!\n\nReadersMagnet Authors' Lounge",

        "text":"What Are the Different Types of Verbs?\n\nThe ProWritingAid Team\nProWritingAid: A grammar guru, style editor, and writing mentor in one package.\nPublished Jan 25, 2016\n\nWhat are the Different Types of Verbs?\n\nYour sentences would lie dead in the water without a verb. Verbs are the most important part of your sentence. But how do you select the right verb to get across your meaning? By understanding the different types of verbs and how they\u2019re used.\n\n\n  1. What is a verb?\n  2. Action verbs get you going.\n  3. Sometimes verbs need a little help.\n  4. Let\u2019s link our thoughts together.\n  5. And in conclusion\u2026\n\nWhat is a verb?\n\nVerbs are action words. They tell us what\u2019s happening in your sentence. They also sometimes tell us about a state of being. There are three types of verbs for use:\n\n  \u2022 Action verbs (which can be transitive or intransitive),\n  \u2022 Modal verbs (sometimes called helping verbs), and\n  \u2022 Auxiliary (sometimes called linking verbs).\n\nAction verbs get you going.\n\nWhen a person or thing is doing something, that\u2019s an action verb. Action verbs are the best ones to use in your writing to move your story forward and create tension. They can be split into two categories:\n\nTransitive verbs.\n\nThis verb is always followed by a noun that\u2019s receiving the action, called the direct object.\n\nI patted my dog\u2019s head.\n\nThe verb is \u201cpatted,\u201d and the noun that\u2019s receiving this action is \u201cmy dog\u2019s head,\u201d which is the direct object of the action verb.\n\nSometimes an object can be indirect, such as when you\u2019re expressing for whom or to whom the action is being done.\n\nMary gave Angelina a kiss on the cheek.\n\nThe verb is \u201cgave\u201d and the object given was \u201ca kiss.\u201d To whom it happened was Angelina, which is an indirect object.\n\nIntransitive verbs.\n\nWhen an action verb has no direct or indirect object, it\u2019s called an intransitive verb. Intransitive verbs can be followed by an adverb or adverb phrase, but there will never be a direct or indirect object.\n\nMatthew runs quickly away from the fire.\n\nThe verb is \u201cruns,\u201d and the phrase \u201cquickly away from the fire\u201d tells us more about the verb, but there is no object here to receive the action.\n\nAn easy way to tell the difference between a transitive and an intransitive verb is to ask the question, \u201cWhat is receiving the action from this verb?\u201d If you can name a noun that\u2019s on the receiving end, it\u2019s a transitive verb. If you can\u2019t name a noun, whether a direct or indirect object, then the verb is intransitive.\n\nSometimes verbs need a little help.\n\nModal verbs help us understand more about the verb in question. They give us hints on the possibility of something happening (can, should, etc.) or time (has, did, was, etc.). When you add a modal or helping verb to your sentence, you\u2019ve created a verb phrase.\n\nLaura is (helping verb) writing (main action verb) her life story.\n\nHer story might (helping verb) be (main verb) embarrassing for some of her friends.\n\nThese words always function as modal verbs, or helping verbs:\n\nCan \u2022 Could \u2022 May \u2022 Might \u2022 Must \u2022 Ought to \u2022 Shall \u2022 Should \u2022 Will \u2022 Would\n\nIn addition, you can have helping verbs consisting of the forms of to be, to do, and to have. Keep in mind though the following words can also serve as linking verbs (which we\u2019ll discuss next):\n\nAm \u2022 Are \u2022 Be \u2022 Been \u2022 Being \u2022 Did \u2022 Do \u2022 Does \u2022 Had \u2022 Has \u2022 Have \u2022 Is \u2022 Was \u2022 Were\n\nJuliet is changing trains at the station.\n\nDaniel had eaten everything on his plate.\n\nLet\u2019s link our thoughts together.\n\nLinking verbs connect the subject of your sentence to a noun or adjective that describes your subject. The noun or adjective is called the \u201csubject complement.\u201d\n\nMy daughter is a marketing major.\n\nWe are your new neighbors.\n\nThe most common linking verb is the various forms of to be (am, are, is, was, were, etc.). Sometimes, the forms of to be are helping verbs, as you learned in the previous section.\n\nTo become and to seem are always linking verbs. The following verbs, however, can sometimes be linking verbs and other times be action verbs:\n\nTo appear \u2022 To continue \u2022 To feel \u2022 To grow \u2022 To look \u2022 To prove \u2022 To remain \u2022 To sound \u2022 To stay \u2022 To smell \u2022 To taste \u2022 To turn\n\nLinking: The seafood smelled funny.\n\nAction: I smelled the seafood before eating.*\n\nAnd in conclusion\u2026\n\nThere you have it\u2014verbs explained. Now that you understand the various forms they can take, use verbs wisely to create movement, tension, and momentum in your work. Make your verbs the strongest possible, and your readers will be happy.\n\nSubscribe for writing hacks, special offers and free stuff\n\nWe will not share your details\nHave you tried \u00a0ProWritingAid\u00a0 yet?

        "text":"\n\nTuesday, November 22\n\n3 Key Elements of Successful Pitching\n\nBy Vivian Conroy @VivWrites\n\nPart of the How They Do It Series\n\nPitching a novel can be a terrifying experience, but if you prepare before you pitch, you not only settle the nerves, but increase your chances of success. Please help me welcome Vivian Conroy to the podium today, to share her thoughts on pitching a novel series.\n\nHooked on mystery since she read her first Agatha Christie at thirteen, Vivian Conroy writes the Lady Alkmene Callender 1920s' mysteries for an imprint of HarperCollins. Book 1, A PROPOSAL TO DIE FOR -- described by reviewers as 'a cross between Downton Abbey and Miss Marple' and 'an exciting, humorous and fabulously witty voyage'-- was released on September 19 and is available through Amazon,, Kobo, Ibooks, and Google Play.\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Goodreads | Amazon | Barnes & Noble\n\nTake it away Vivian...\n\nWhen the editor called me to offer me a 3-book deal for my Lady Alkmene Callender 1920s' mystery series, she told me that after reading a sentence or two she already knew this book was something she'd want to buy. I had submitted to a special call by the publisher for books opening with a proposal. That was it. Open with a proposal and the rest is up to you.\n\nAll I knew for sure was that I needed to send a pitch letter, a first chapter and a synopsis.\n\nWriters will often find themselves in that same position. You are submitting to a contest, including pages with a query to an agent, or sending in requested work after a conference pitch. You need a pitch letter, a sample of your manuscript and a synopsis. Established authors sell on proposal which is also a pitch, sample and synopsis. Each element in this package serves specific purposes in convincing the editor or agent that you understand your genre and your craft. By focusing on those functions as you prepare the material, you increase your chances of selling the proposed book or even book series.\n\n1. The Pitch Letter\n\nThe special call I responded to asked for books starting with a proposal so I knew the concept of proposal had to play an important part in the submission. So first thing to do is ask yourself: what is the publisher looking for within this line or imprint or, in case of an agent, how does my book fit what the agent represents or has asked for in a wishlist? A romance publisher will like to see romantic hooks or tropes like secret baby, marriage of convenience or amnesia. A mystery publisher will like to see key mystery elements such as an evocative setting, characters the reader will relate to and root for, plus series potential.\n\nIn all cases your title is extremely important to convey that first impression of concept. It has to fit what works in your genre. For cozy mystery titles are often a pun, a sort of funny reference to the murderous situation. A Proposal To Die For did just that for me.\n\nIn the pitch letter you also show you understand your genre by your short pitch. For me that was: 'a fun mystery with series potential, in the vein of Christie, Sayers and Wentworth, about a titled heroine with an unladylike interest in fast-acting poisons and unnatural death, who meets her match in a determined reporter.'\n\nIt shows off the main characters, the setting and sets the tone I also use in the book.\n\nYour pitch letter can also state how you see your book fitting in the publisher's offer or the agent's list, to show you have researched the publisher or agent and believe your work is a good match for them.\n\n2. Sample of the Manuscript\n\nThe chapter or sample pages have to show off voice and writing skills. Here you introduce the editor or agent to your world and characters. Avoid the pitfall of giving a ton of backstory. Instead start with action and trust that reader will be curious about the rest and follow along. My opening started with a line of dialogue (the proposal asked for) that Lady Alkmene overhears. Immediately her curiosity is piqued and she moves in to hear more. I didn't explain at all that we are at a party, who Lady Alkmene is, or why she is there. I thrust the reader into the action: a few whispered words, curiosity on Alkmene's part and off we go onto a path that will lead to murder and her acquaintance with her sleuthing partner Jake Dubois.\n\nAlthough we don't get to know a whole lot about Alkmene in the opening scene (we do learn her father is traveling, but not whereto or why), we do see those character traits that will aid her in sleuthing: curiosity, fascination with human psychology and a need for adventure, a deep desire to exchange the everyday for something mysterious and spectacular. All other things can be added in later.\n\n3. Synopsis\n\nEach editor and agent has a different preference so some read the synopsis before sample pages, others after. Either way, the synopsis has to show you have enough plot for a whole book and you stay true to genre. In a cozy mystery you can't have a serial killer leaving dead bodies everywhere or the protagonists fleeing in a stolen helicopter. So check your synopsis for the key elements a publisher or agent wants to see for your genre and for any items that might not be a good fit or might cause doubt (for instance don't spend a lot of time on characters that only appear once or twice to avoid the idea they are too dominant).\n\nAlthough a synopsis is generally regarded as descriptive, you can infuse voice by word choice. Again this has to be appropriate for your genre.\n\nAnd if you get the opportunity, like me, to explain it's a series and pitch sequels, convey the overall series feel and spend a sentence or two, three on the sequels. Just to give a taste of what you want to do. In my case I focused on:\na. the various settings (book 1 is in London, book 2 on a country manor, book 3 on an excavation site in Cornwall)\nb. basic plot (for book 2: to clear a cat burglar of murder charge, Lady Alkmene must infiltrate a household where everybody has a secret)\nc. atmosphere\/flavor. The latter depends mainly on word choice again: make it appropriate for your genre and voice.\nIf your pitch package is successful, you will be asked for more material or - if you are established - you can even sell on this proposal alone. Conveying your book's concept and scope in an engaging manner is a skill you will be able to use throughout your career. So hone it!\n\nAbout A Proposal to Die For\n\nWhen a wealthy art collector dies, Lady Alkmene suspects his recently recovered heir, beautiful American actress Evelyn Steinbeck, of involvement in the death. But she is not the only one thinking it was murder: reporter Jake Dubois, just in from Paris where he covered crime, is also on the case. Jake doesn't believe a lady like Alkmene can investigate, but he has to admit her contacts can get him into places he himself has no access to. On her part Alkmene must acknowledge Jake is a lot more street savvy than she is. Together this unlikely duo follow a trail of clues to uncover a dark secret hidden away in the marshes of Dartmoor.\n\nBook 2, DIAMONDS OF DEATH, about stolen stones and family secrets, released on October 17, while book 3, DEADLY TREASURES, released on November 21.\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Goodreads | Amazon | Barnes & Noble\n\n1 comment:\n\n  1.

        "text":"Understanding Elements That Make Up a Short Story\n\nThe most basic elements of a story are setting, characters, plot, conflict and theme. Recognizing what each of these elements adds to the story helps the reader understand the structure and meaning of a short story. Understanding how these elements work together also gives the reader an appreciation for the purpose of the short story.\n\n\nThe setting is the time and the place in which a short story takes place. The setting puts boundaries and expectations in place for the reader. For example, a short story that takes place in a school in early September gives the reader a certain expectation of what might happen within the traditional school year. Placing the story in a school in a different time -- late July -- might change the reader's expectation for what the story might bring about. The setting creates a foundation for the other elements of the story.\n\n\nEach short story needs a cast of characters to move the plot along. Characters are actors within the narrative. They are the heart of the story and are part of the problem and the resolution of the plot. Characters are also the main vehicle through which a reader identifies with a short story. Authors help the reader understand the character by relating how they act, their physical appearance, their speech and interactions with other characters, how others see them and other simple descriptions. For example, Margaret Mitchell opens \"Gone with the Wind\" by introducing the main female character, \"Scarlet O'Hara was not beautiful.\" Developing characters over the course of the story makes them seem more realistic, which in turn can keep the reader interested in the story.\n\n\nThe plot is the events that happen within a story. In a successful short story, a plot should build suspense, becoming more exciting as the story moves through the events until it reaches the climax, or most dramatic part of the story. Sometimes a story may end with the climax, but often writers will include a section to round out their narrative, tying up the lose ends of the plot to make the story a complete whole.\n\n\nThe conflict is the problem the characters encounter within the plot of the story. This problem adds drama to the story and is an important part of story telling, because without a conflict, a story lacks excitement. A conflict is usually introduced near the beginning of the story and continues to build until it is finally dealt with in the climax. The problem may be complex and may need to be fully resolved after the climax.\n\n\nA theme is a main idea of a story or a lesson the author wants the reader to learn. The longer the story, the more themes it may have; however, short stories may also contain a number of themes. They may be major topics such as love, family, sacrifice or isolation, or they may also be the moral of the story. Themes can be implied or they can be a central belief clearly expressed by the author about one or more of life's issues.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSusan Rickey started writing in 1994 with a technology feature article for the \"Pioneer Press.\" She was the writer of the Klamath Forest Alliance newsletter, an environmental organization. Rickey obtained her teaching credential from California State University and acquired her Bachelor of Science from the University of Arkansas.\n\nPhoto Credits\n  \u2022 BananaStock\/BananaStock\/Getty Images",
