The survey followed the launch of the Heart of Eden Community Plan and was distributed with a copy of the Executive Summary. The purpose of the survey was to identify the need for affordable housing and to fulfil one of the action plans laid out in the Community Plan. This report details the information derived from the survey responses.\n\nThe survey work undertaken at local level provides information for Parish Councils\/Meetings regarding the housing needs of their community and is essential evidence for Eden District Council, Planners, Registered Social Landlords and developers to establish if there is a need for affordable housing.\n\nCopies of the findings of the survey are distributed to Bolton Parish Council, Eden District Council, and are placed on the Cumbria Rural Housing Trust web site.The Survey\n\n194 survey forms were delivered by hand to the households and 5 forms were posted to businesses within the parish of Bolton (100%), with a return date of 29th March 2010. 114 households returned their completed forms, which is a return rate of 58.24% and 1 business form was returned giving a return rate of 20%. The overall return rate was 57.29% which is and well above the current average of 30% for this type of survey in Cumbria. Cumbria Rural Housing Trust expresses its thanks to the Heart of Eden Community Plan Group, the Parish Council and others in the community for their work to promote the survey.\n\nOf the returned forms, there were 13 (11.4%) responses, saying that either the whole household or someone living within the household wished to move within the parish in the next 5 years.\n\n\u00a0See Appendix 1 for the criteria used to determine whether a household is in need.Housing Need1 of the households stated that they were registered on the Local Authority and\/or a Housing Association or other waiting list.\n\nOf these 13 survey responses, indicating a housing need, some had a multiple need; giving 21 in total, of these 5 households are in need of affordable housing within the next 5 years in the parish.\n\nDownload this file (Bolton HNS.PDF)Bolton HNS.PDF[\u00a0]2162 kB",

        "text":"Eisenhower Dollar Die States\n\n\n\n\u201cDie State\u201d is a way of expressing the appearance of dies as they age.\n\nOn struck coins, increasing die age appears as increasingly crude metal flow off minor devices, as muddled details and as \u201cdie flow lines\u201d (increasing coarse generally radial lines seen in fields and on major devices).\n\nDel Romaines laid out the typical appearance of coin dies as they age, expressed in percent of the die\u2019s life.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He determined for all coin metals and sizes (except Ikes which he did not study) that his percentages hold for all the series he studied, even though the absolute production numbers change as a function of coin size and hardness of planchet metal\n\nThe Ike Group proposes that the much larger Ike coupled with its hard and abrasive CuNI-clad layer not only wore out the W-1 steel dies used for the 1971 and most 1972 Ikes faster than dies in other series but the dies also aged prematurely within that framework.\u00a0\u00a0We found that Del\u2019s definitions and percentages did not apply to 71-2 Ikes and suggested revised definitions based on use of a 10 X loupe.\n\nThe dies used for the 1973 and on Ikes, however, do fit well into Del\u2019s die-state framework except these Ike dies were not pushed as hard as the dies of other series so a greater proportion of these Ikes are in earlier die states.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even so, it\u2019s likely these dies produced 250,000 Ikes on average thanks to the newly employed 52100 die steel.\n\n\nDel Romaines, the father of Die States\n\nThe \u201cstate\u201d of a die is the amount of wear it shows.\u00a0\u00a0Credit Del Romines with the first serious attempt to match die states (the degree of die wear) with the numbers of coins struck in each die state.\u00a0\u00a0Working meticulously in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, his research provided the first understanding of just how fast dies age through their die states.\u00a0\u00a0Del proved that dies spend more then half their life in a state of heavy wear.\n\nDel determined the production of each die state expressed as a percentage of average die life and arrived at the conclusion that these percentages held for all dies regardless of size or hardness of the planchets being struck.\u00a0\u00a0He did not include Ikes in his studies, however.\n\nHere are Del\u2019s definitions and percentages for the Die State parameters he created.\u00a0\u00a0Note that Del\u2019s primary work was on cents where the smaller letter devices can wash out more severely in advancing die states than is the case with the lettering on Ikes:\n\n  \u2022 Very Early Die State (VEDS): \u00a00 \u2013 0.21%\u00a0of a die\u2019s average life;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has \u201cthe intact original die surfaces\u201d (usually\u00a0\u00a0not flat-smooth and sometimes showing microscopic die cracks (\u201cheat checks\u201d from the final die hardening heat treatment)) \u201cwith no metal movement lines\u201d (die flow lines) except microscopic beginning just as a die enters EDS.\n  \u2022 Early Die State (EDS): \u00a00.21 \u2013 2.63% -\u00a0has \u201conly very minor metal movement lines, normally starting from the designs that are the highest relief in relation to the field and will run from the letter, date, or design toward the rim.\u00a0\u00a0All macroscopic detail will be as sharp as VEDS\u201d\u00a0\u00a0(\u201cmacroscopic\u201d means visible to naked eye).\n  \u2022 Middle Die State (MDS):\u00a02.63 \u2013 9.13%\u00a0- will have \u201clost all of the microscopic markings of the new die and some of the macroscopic designs will have begun to fade.\u00a0\u00a0On a doubled die coin, some divisions and\/or separation lines will have blended with the doubling and will create an appearance of Class VI (Class VI is a type of doubled die (hub doubled die) without separation so letters typically just appear broader).\u00a0\u00a0Heavy metal flow lines will be evident on the tops of all or most lettering near the rim in the form of a sloped, lined smear and the lettering no longer has sharp edges\u201d (somewhat paraphrased and expanded for clarity).\n  \u2022 Late Die State (LDS):\u00a09.13 \u2013 35%\u00a0- coins \u201cwill have lost most of the macroscopic detail.\u00a0\u00a0Very heavy metal flow lines will be evident\u201d.\n  \u2022 Very Late Die\u00a0State (VLDS)35% and on\u00a0-\u00a0coins \u201cwill have lost all major detail.\u00a0\u00a0The metal flow lines will be extremely heavy and in many cases may join the lettering to the rim with very heavy lines which are almost solid at times.\n\nDel began his die state research in the 1970\u2019s by gathering over a thousand 1960 obverse doubled die Lincoln cents (2-R-VI) to arrive at a tight range of mintages for each die state.\u00a0\u00a0Why the DDO Lincoln?\u00a0\u00a0Because it is a one-die coin!\u00a0\u00a0He placed each DDO cent in the pile that corresponded to one of his 5 defined die states and thereby developed a population and percentage for each die state.\u00a0\u00a0Was that a meticulous piece of work, a labor of love, or what!\n\nIn 1996 Del published in the March-April edition of CONECA\u2019s ErrorScope the only account of his die state research in a numismatic journal.\u00a0\u00a0In that article, and in other accounts provided by his private publication and comments by others who knew him well, Del expanded and slightly revised his die state percentages to encompass gold and silver coins, nickels, clad quarters and clad half dollars.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He knew that average die production (average number of coins struck per die) varied with the size and metal of the coin being struck but he found that the\u00a0percentage\u00a0struck in each die state was basically the same.\n\nAs to some reasonably hard production numbers, here is part of a 1972 US Mint report on average obverse die production for the various 1971 coins (the reverse dies lasted about 20% longer):\n\nOne Cent \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01,000,000\nFive Cent \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 170,000\nTwenty Five Cent\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0155,000\nFifty Cent \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0150,000\nOne Dollar \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0100,000\n\nNickel-clad Ike Dollar Die States\n\nDel never studied the Eisenhower Dollar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The authors suspect if he had tried (and he may have), the change to more resilient 52100 die steel in late 1972 would have made his meticulous approach difficult, especially since there is no way he could have accumulated large one-die samples of a one-die Ike let alone a one-die 1971-1972 Ike and a one-die 1973-and-on Ike.\n\nThe Ike Group therefore took up the challenge, looking at Ikes from a die-state perspective, examining separately those struck with struck with W-1 tool steel (1971 and most 1972 Ikes, hereafter \u201c71-2 Ikes\u201d), and those struck with the more resilient 52100 tool steel (1973-and-on, hereafter \u201c73-on Ikes\u201d).\n\n\u201971-2 Ike Die States\n\nWe found Eisenhower \u201971-2 dies did not behave as Del described:\n\n  1. Metal flow off minor devices generally was toward the central device more than toward the rim (Figure 1).\n  2. \u00a0Die flow lines seemed to occur and advance faster than Del described (Figure 2).\n  3. At times, the most severe die flow lines occurred in regions of greatest change in relief on the central device and these changes were often more advanced than one would expect based on die-flow smearing of the minor devices (Figure 4):\u00a0\u00a0at other times, the strongest flow lines were in the fields and the central device remained smooth.\n  4. Minor devices held up better than one would expect based on Del\u2019s definitions.\n  5. Some \u201971-2 Ikes displayed premature \u201corange skin\u201d on the central device, normally a marker of LDS and VLDS, well in advance of any \u201cheavy flow lines\u201d on the field or \u201csmearing\u201d of letter devices (Figure 5).\n\nDie Flow Lines and Orange Skin\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat causes die flow lines and Orange Skin?\u201d you ask.\u00a0\u00a0Good question!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A coin being struck is subject to roughly 100 tons per square inch pressure:\u00a0\u00a0this pressure is great enough to cause some molecules of die steel and some molecules of the tough copper-nickel alloy of the planchet\u2019s outer layers to penetrate each other\u2019s surfaces, that is, to become inter-woven and bonded.\n\nAs the planchet metal becomes somewhat plastic under the intense pressure, it \u201cflows\u201d to and into the rim and the central device.\u00a0\u00a0This flow rips some die steel molecules out of the die\u2019s surface.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s a kind of erosion, akin to a sandy or gravel bank exposed to water flow.\u00a0\u00a0Inevitably tiny crevices form and continually coalesce and enlarge until one has large-scale erosion patterns.\u00a0\u00a0The process of flow erosion on a die\u2019s surface is similar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Die flow lines in some regions of the die start small and get larger and larger as a die ages, generally wherever the change in relief is greatest or wherever in the fields the linear flow toward either rim or central device is greatest.\n\n\u201cOrange Skin\u201d may be akin to the pattern of nodes and valleys that form when waves (die-flow lines) come at each other from different directions, perhaps due to a die settling somewhat.\u00a0\u00a0We think Orange Skin may be more prevalent in the 71-2 Ikes than it is in other coin series and certainly more prevalent than in 73-on Ikes because of the severe \u201cdie sink\u201d problem the Mint encountered with its 71-2 W1 die steel.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, more severe die settling caused more significant changes in planchet metal flow directions as the die aged.\n\nPlanchet Metal Flow Zone of Balance\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0The authors suggest that planchet metal flow in smaller denominations starts from a \u201czone of balance\u201d roughly midway between rim and central device such that planchet metal flows a relatively short distance from that zone toward the rim and a relatively short distance from that zone toward the central device.\u00a0\u00a0We think that the Ike\u2019s much larger central device volume (think of volume as the cube of linear dimensions) may have moved the \u201czone of balance\u201d closer to the rim, perhaps somewhere within the peripheral letter devices rather than between those devices and the central device.\u00a0\u00a0If we are correct, these minor devices would have suffered less die-flow erosion compared to smaller coins and it could be seen in either direction rather than just toward the rim.\n\nNot only is the Ike significantly larger than other modern coins, the flow distance from the zone of balance to the central device would be disproportionately longer.\n\nSince die wear would be proportional to the volume and distance the planchet metal moved as well as the hardness and abrasiveness of the pl...

        "text":"The Interaction of Man and Dog over Time\n\nThis report (click here to access the full report) focuses on the relationship between man and dogs and at what point man takes control of the canine species and domesticated them, how they evolved into the different types of dogs that are available today, either through intense breeding programmes or natural evolution, and what dogs are used for in today\u2019s modern society.\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Domestication\n  \u2022 Evolution of the Dog\n  \u2022 Breeding\n  \u2022 Types of Dog\n  \u2022 Conclusion\n\n\nA \u2013 Time-line of Interaction between Man and Animals\nB \u2013 Other uses for dogs\n\n\n\nMan soon learned that having identified certain behavioural and physiological characteristics of animals, certain species would be a better candidate for domestication than others, making them a faithful and useful companion when it came to hunting and gathering. (UOR) On the whole, most domesticated animals and in particular dogs show the following traits:-\n\n  \u2022 hardy and flexible;\n  \u2022 easy to feed;\n  \u2022 able to adjust to new conditions temperature and confinement;\n  \u2022 show a liking for humans, comforting;\n  \u2022 easy to breed;\n  \u2022 social and capable of group interactions;\n  \u2022 gregarious; and\n  \u2022 able to maintain a dominance hierarchy, and are thus predisposed to submission. (UOR)\n\nMankind has been a hunter gatherer for just 0.5% of human history. During the Ice Age, large mammals such as bison had two predators humans and wolves, both using their intelligence and social skills to bring down prey much larger than themselves by hunting and killing in groups (see picture overleaf). (Gascoigne, 2001)\n\nDue to their similarity, it became mutually beneficial for the two teams to join up and share their hunting skills and their kill with each other which is why dogs have been mankind\u2019s most oldest and faithful companions since the Pleistocene era during the last Ice Age. (Gascoigne, 2001)\n\n\nEvolution of the Dog\n\nDNA tests have proved the today\u2019s dog has evolved from the grey wolf (Canis lupus familiaris). Arhaeological digs have unearthed the bones of domesticated dog dating back to the Pleistocene era and the timeline in the Appendix to this report shows references of where and when bones have been found since this era. (Jensen, 2007)\n\nThese various bones show a shortened facial region of the skull, compacted teeth in the jaw bones, a more curved mandible, the eyes become more rounded and forward looking, the frontal sinuses become swollen and the tympanic bullae is reduced in size and flattened (see picture below) together with the slender metapodial and toe bones that distinguish them from those of the wolf. (Jensen, 2007)\n\nThe remains suggest that they had originated from the smaller South Asian wolf subspecies rather than the large North American and North Eurasian wolf, excluding the possibility of an African origin. (Jensen, 2007)\n\nWild animals need a high degree of perception and quick reactions to stressful situations in order to survive, which are quite opposite to the characteristics of docility. As an animal\u2019s stress and fear is reduced, it\u2019s perception of this environment brings about hormonal changes which reduces brain size (see picture below) and general senses \u2013 mainly hearing and sight. The domesticated animal will also retain a juvenile attitude well into adulthood. (Serpell, 2002)\n\nThe picture below shows that even though a wolf and dog can be of the same weight, the head of the domesticated dog is significantly smaller due to the reduction in brain size.\n\nThe only genetic difference between the wolf and all breed of dogs is allelomorphic \u2013 the changes in the rates and times at which various development events occur as they all have identical karyotypes, making them interfertile. (Serpell, 2002)\n\nEarly Chinese dogs are thought to be directly descended from the small Chinese Wolf, Canis lupus chanco (see picture below). These dogs moved across the Berings Straits into North America with early human immigrants. Later, the dogs of the Inuit and North Americans were interbred with wolves and sometimes even coyotes. At the same time, Africa was cross breeding dogs with the four species of jackal. (Serpell, 2002)\n\nThe dingo is the result of cross breeding the domesticated small wolf of India Canis lupus pallipes, and the pariah dogs of South East Asia, however after being taken over to Australia, they soon escaped their domestic lifestyle and became feral again. (Serpell, 2002)\n\nDuring the domestication process of dog from wolf, the animal would first change its coat colour. A paler coat colour signified a more manageable animal. As the animal\u2019s perception to its environment changes, other morphology and physiological features are ears becoming dropped due to reduced sense of hearing, tails curled due to reduced need to communicate, hair becomes thicker and in some cases flops over the eyes, reducing its speed and impairs its vision. They would also develop an earlier reproductive cycle and have a higher litter number and size was stunted as during early domestication, animals suffered from malnutrition from the time of conception.

This improves the plant's mineral absorption capabilities.\n\nThe mechanisms of increased absorption are both physical and chemical.\u00a0 Mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root, and thus can explore a greater volume of soil, providing a larger surface area for absorption.\u00a0 Mycorrhizal fungi are especially beneficial for plants in nutrient-poor soils.\n\nMycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to diseases, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne pathogens, and are also more resistant to the effects of drought.\u00a0 This is an important thing to consider in the rain challenged Bay Area.\u00a0\n\nSeeds of the following plants were started in one inch cells in a green house on March 3, 2011:\u00a0 golden chard, strawberry spinach, double red orach spinach, epazote (Mexican culinary herb), edible Japanese chrysanthemum garland round leaved and cardoon (related to the artichoke).\u00a0 On March 23rd, the seedlings were transplanted into four inch containers.\u00a0 On April 5th the seedlings were planted, half of each variety, into two beds at Elkus Ranch Research Garden. The soil in both beds consisted of a combination of 50% Elkus compost and 50% Elkus dirt.\n\nOn planting:\nBed A was given a root inoculant consisting of a blend of endomycorrhizal species selected by the manufacturer specifically for vegetables.\u00a0 A 1\/2-ounce dry inoculum was mixed with \u00bd gallon of water.\u00a0 A siphon mixer was attached to a standard garden hose bib, the hose screwed into the other end of the mixer, and the flexible mixer tubing fed into the container of inoculum.\u00a0 The \u00bd gallon of soluble inoculum was automatically mixed into 8 gallons of water and applied directly to the soil resulting in a deep soak.\u00a0 (According to the manufacturer, the dry mix can also be sprinkled into rows prior to planting or under transplants as they are being placed in the soil.)\n\nBed B was given a good watering at planting using H2O straight from the hose.\n\nBoth beds received 10 minutes of drip irrigation every day for the first two weeks.\u00a0 On April 17th, irrigation was reduced to 10 minutes every other day due to cool, foggy spring weather.\n\nThe following measurements, recorded in inches, were taken on May 10th:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inoculated Height\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-Inoculated Height\nCardoon 6\" 6\"\nGolden Chard 10\" 7\"\nEpazote 5\" 5\"\nJapanese Chrysanthemum\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\" 5\"\nOrach Spinach 16\" 13\"\nStrawberry Spinach 9\" 8\"\n\nThe following measurements, recorded in inches, were taken on June 14th:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inoculated Height\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-inoculated Height\u00a0\u00a0\nCardoon 28\" 27\"\nGolden Chard\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 19\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 19\"\nEpazote 20\" 17\"\nJapenese Chrysanthemum\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 38\" 36\"\nOrach Spinach 28\" 26\"\nStrawberry Spinach 8\" 10\"\n\nThe vegetables that received inoculum grew slightly taller than those that did not receive inoculum (except for the strawberry spinach).\u00a0 We began harvesting and eating the plants mid June.\u00a0 A very informal \u2018taste test\u2019 was conducted on plants from the two beds.\u00a0 It consisted of asking volunteers to comment on what they noticed, if anything, between samples from Beds A and B.\u00a0 They were not told from which bed their samples came.\u00a0 Four of the five subjects thought that the samples of spinach, both strawberry and orach, were \u2018sweeter\u2019 from the beds receiving inoculum.\u00a0 No difference was noted for the other plants.\n\nThe golden chard grown in Bed B without inoculum, suffered severe leaf damage from leaf miners. These critters feed within the tissues of the leaves themselves, selectively eating only the layers that have the least amount of cellulose.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 The chard receiving inoculum at planting had no leaf damage.\n\nThe cardoon plants in the inoculated beds grew to a massive height of over 8 feet by September:\n\nwhile those in the non inoculated beds only grew to 4 feet.\n\u00a0 The Japanese chrysanthemums grew over 9 feet tall in the inoculated beds. \u00a0The author peering through her produce.\n\u00a0 Those in the non inoculated beds grew under 4 feet.\n\nThe vegetables in the bed that received mycorrhizal fungi inoculum grew larger (cardoon, epazote and chrysanthemum), were more disease resistant (chard) and, according to a very small sample size, sweeter tasting (strawberry and orach spinaches) than the vegetables grown without inoculum.\n\nI will continue to experiment with the use of mycorrhizal fungi plant inoculum in future plantings, and believe that it has great application in new beds and soils that may be nutrient poor.\u00a0 I would caution the home gardener that if they are interested in using mycorrhizal fungi, to purchase inoculum from a reputable source and do your homework first.\u00a0 Scientific analysis has shown that many of the \u2018over the counter\u2019 products that claim to contain live mycelium, do not in fact live up to that promise.\n\nFor more information, please contact the Master Gardener Help Line at (650) 726-9059 ext 107\n\nWritten by:\u00a0Janet Didur, Master Gardener\n\nWebmaster Email:",
