We\u2019ll highlight some of the most common heater problems and identify the best solutions to fix them, whether it\u2019s repair or replacement.\n\nYou\u2019ll find more information on the following common heating problems:\n\nImage of Goodman forced air furnace\n\nThe Goodman GCSS920804CN 80,000 BTU, 92% AFUE Single-Stage Gas Furnace is an extremely efficient central heating powerhouse.\n\nWhat Can Cause a Furnace to Stop Working?\n\nWe often hear the question why is my heater not working, and the truth is, there are many different possibilities. Furnaces are complex systems that require a good amount of maintenance. There are a lot of moving parts and pieces that could be contributing to the system not working properly. The air filter could be dirty, there could be a crack causing a leak, one of the many parts could be loose, worn down, or need to be replaced, or a number of other issues could arise.\n\nFurnace maintenance should not be overlooked and is imperative to keeping the system running properly. If you\u2019re starting to notice a lack of performance, get the system checked out right away.\n\nCentral Heating\u00a0Problems\n\nAlso known as forced air furnaces, central heating systems distribute heat throughout your home through a series of ducts. That being said, sometimes furnace problems are the result of faulty ducts, a defective heater or both.\n\nProblem: Heater is blowing cold air\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why your heater is blowing out cool air, the first thing you should do is check your thermostat and make sure it\u2019s set to the correct temperature. Try kicking it up a notch to see if there\u2019s a noticeable difference. Make sure it\u2019s set to \u201cauto\u201d instead of \u201cfan on\u201d \u2014 otherwise, your fan will run without blowing any heat. If you\u2019ve checked your thermostat and verified that it was indeed on the right setting, then your issue may be one of many, including:\n\n  \u2022 Dirty air filter \u2013 Air filters become dirty over time and need to be cleaned or replaced \u2014 otherwise, dirt and debris can inhibit your furnace\u2019s performance and cause it to blow cold air. Change your air filter and see if that fixes the problem.\n  \u2022 Leaky ductwork \u2013 Leaky ductwork is a virtually invisible problem, but it can cost you if it\u2019s not resolved. If you\u2019re comfortable with it, go into your attic or crawl space to check for leaks by walking alongside your ductwork and feeling for any blowing air. Bring a lit stick of incense with you and hold it near your ducts; if the smoke starts to move, that\u2019s a telltale sign you have a leak in that spot. Seal off any leaks and insulate your ducts accordingly.\n  \u2022 Pilot light issues \u2013 Check your furnace pilot light and make sure it\u2019s lit. If it won\u2019t light, make sure gas is flowing to it \u2014 check the gas valve and verify that it\u2019s turned on. If your gas valve is on and your pilot light still won\u2019t light (or it lights but doesn\u2019t stay lit), you\u2019ll want to contact a professional to examine the issue.\n  \u2022 Lack of fuel \u2013 Whether you have a gas, electric, or oil furnace, your system needs fuel to properly run. If you\u2019re low on fuel \u2014 or if fuel is unable to effectively power your furnace \u2014 your heater will not work as well as it should.\n\nIf none of these seem to be the issue, you should contact an HVAC professional to examine your heating system more thoroughly.\n\nProblem: Heater will not light\/stay lit\n\nIf your furnace is newer, it may not have a pilot light. Rather, it most likely uses electronic ignition. These newer systems will have a flame system to make sure that gas isn\u2019t flowing without the heater being on. Sometimes, these sensors get dirty and need to be replaced \u2014 be on the lookout for this issue when inspecting your furnace. Cleaning and replacing these sensors is an easy fix you can do yourself. \u00a0\n\nProblem: Heater won\u2019t shut off\n\nIf your furnace won\u2019t stop running and blowing hot air, you should first check your thermostat and make sure it\u2019s set to \u201cauto\u201d instead of \u201con\u201d \u2014 this way, the furnace will shut off when it reaches a certain temperature.\n\nIf your heater still won\u2019t stop running, your problem could be one of two issues:\n\n  \u2022 Your thermostat is broken or miswired\n  \u2022 Your furnace blower is malfunctioning\n\nFirst, examine your thermostat\u2019s wires to ensure everything is plugged in correctly. Next, reset your thermostat to factory settings and try running your system again. If this doesn\u2019t resolve the issue, you may need to replace your thermostat.\n\nIf you replace your thermostat and your furnace continues to run, your problem could be the result of a blower issue. Contact your trusted heating professional immediately for further inspection.\n\nProblem: Certain parts of the house are not heating\n\nIf your heater is unevenly distributing heat throughout your home, your issue could be attributed to two primary things: dirty air filters and inadequate ductwork. Check your air filters for dust and debris and change them accordingly.\n\nIf your air filters are clean, or if replacing them doesn\u2019t resolve the issue, you may need to inspect your ducts for leaks. Should you find that your ducts need additional work, contact an HVAC professional for further inspection.\n\nProblem: Controls are not working\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to properly control your furnace, the problem most likely has to do with your thermostat. Again, make sure your thermostat is set to the correct temperature, then try replacing the batteries to see if that fixes the problem. If it doesn\u2019t, reset the thermostat per your manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nIf resetting doesn\u2019t resolve the issue, as a last resort, you can pop open your thermostat and examine the wiring to make sure it\u2019s correct.\n\nIf none of these actions resolve your problem, you most likely need to buy a new thermostat.\n\nProblem: Fan is not working\n\nIf your furnace\u2019s fan isn\u2019t working, check your thermostat and make sure it\u2019s set to the correct setting. Then, check your air filters and make sure they\u2019re not so dirty that airflow is restricted. Extremely dirty air filters can sometimes cause your fan to stop working altogether.\n\nNext, check your circuit breakers and make sure they\u2019re on. (Note: Only turn your breakers on once. Flipping them on and off repeatedly can cause a fire!)\n\nIf turning on your circuit breakers doesn\u2019t fix the problem, you\u2019ll want to call an HVAC professional to inspect your system, as you most likely have a more complex problem on your hands.\n\nProblem: Mold in your furnace\n\nMoisture buildup is oftentimes the result of poor insulation or inadequate ductwork, creating the perfect environment for mold to grow.\n\nIf you have mold in your furnace, you\u2019ll want to hire a professional to clean your system and take the necessary steps to prevent mold from growing in the future. This includes making sure your ducts and crawl space are properly insulated and sealed to prevent moisture accumulation.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to have your HVAC specialist clean your ducts every few years for preventative maintenance. Regularly changing your air filters will also help keep your system as clean as possible.\n\nProblem: Heater smells like burning\n\nA burnt smell \u2014 or a heater that\u2019s actually smoking \u2014 is a clear sign that something is wrong. If your furnace smells like burning, shut it off and unplug it immediately, as leaving your heater on can potentially be hazardous. However, an unpleasant smell can merely be a sign of a dirty air filter or dust buildup in the furnace. Try not to panic and take swift action immediately.\n\nAfter unplugging your heater, inspect your system for dust or blockage and clean accordingly. You may also want to replace or clean your air filters for good measure.\n\nIf the problem persists, you should contact a professional to check your electrical components or chimney for blockage.\n\nProblem: Furnace is Short Cycling\n\nShort cycling is when the furnace turns on and then rapidly turns off. Short cycling can result in only portions of the areas you are heating to warm up. This can be caused by a variety of issues including:\n\n  \u2022 Dirty filter\n  \u2022 Oversized unit\n  \u2022 Thermostat fault\n  \u2022 Thermostat placement\n\nFurnaces are designed to run and work best when they are on for at least 15 minutes at a time. Shorter runs can impact the heat exchanger overtime.\n\nImage of Dimplex electric fireplace\nThe Dimplex BLF50 Synergy 50\u2033 Wall-Mount Landscape Electric Firebox is a stunning LED fireplace that can be used with or without heat for year-round enjoyment.\n\nRoom Heating Issues\n\nWhether you have an electric fireplace, an\u00a0infrared or blue flame space heater\u00a0or a wall mounted unit,\u00a0room heater problems are easier (and usually less expensive!) to resolve compared to central heat systems. However, it\u2019s oftentimes better to simply buy a new room heater rather than trying to fix it, as a seemingly simple repair can potentially cost you more in the long run.\n\nProblem: Controls not working correctly\n\nIf your heater\u2019s controls seem to be faulty, first unplug the unit and plug it back in to see if that resolves the issue.\n\nNext, check the heater\u2019s thermostat (if it has one) and make sure it\u2019s set to the correct setting. Try resetting it to see if that fixes the problem. If not, there could be an internal wiring issue \u2014 unplug your heater, carefully pry open the thermostat and make sure all wires are connected correctly. Consult your owner\u2019s manual for guidance if necessary.\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t fix the issue, or if you have a room radiator instead of an electric or gas heater with a thermostat, contact your local HVAC professional for advice. Replacing your heater may end up costing you less than hiring someone to fix your heater, so it\u2019s best to ... (truncated)",

Patrick Galen Dempsey can be an American actor, most widely known for his role as neurosurgeon Dr. Derek \"McDreamy\" Shepherd on Grey's Anatomy. Professional Patrick Dempsey and his wife, Jillian, a well-known makeup artist turned jewelry custom made and sculptor, live a stylish but relaxed, family-friendly presence in a Frank Gehry-designed home in the hillsides above Malibu (Architectural Process).\n\nIf you're searching for a kitchen color tendency that will stick around, black and white is your answer.

The best news about this tendency is its versatility. As kitchen d?cor tendencies change, you may easily incorporate the look.\n\nAdele's cottage-style bathroom is just as wonderful as her vocals. The master bedroom has two large closets and a shiny and beautiful bath.

        "text":"5 Tips to Consider When Moving Your Family For Your Job\n\nIs relocation for a new job worth it for your family? Here are a few ways to evaluate if moving your family for your job is the right decision.\n\n1. Check-In with Your Family\n\nThe most significant discussion you can have with your family is making sure everyone is on board with this decision. Sitting your family down and openly discussing the positives and negatives of your relocation is a helpful way to answer any questions or ease any fears they might have about the move. Be prepared for your children to have uneasiness about this life change, as they most likely haven\u2019t had to deal with as much unfamiliarity in their lives as you have. Remember to be patient as it may take some time for them to fully grasp what it will mean to relocate their lives. It can also be helpful to come prepared with a list of a few positive aspects of your new city. Is there an amusement park down the street? Will you be living next to the beach? Are there any interesting museums or indoor attractions that they might enjoy? All of these things can help them better envision the move.\n\n2. Make Sure the Timing is Right\n\nWhile it may be an ideal time for you to make a career transition, make sure that the timing will work for your spouse as well. If your spouse recently started a new position, is finishing schooling or is in the middle of a big life change, it may not be the best time to relocate. If your spouse is willing to move, you\u2019ll want to make sure that your job is able to support both you and your spouse until he or she can find a new opportunity in the new city. If you have children, you\u2019ll want to make sure that you\u2019re not uprooting them at a crucial time in their schooling. For example, it\u2019s always easier to move in the summer before school starts so that they can have a fresh start at a new school in the fall versus in the middle of the school year. You\u2019ll also want to do your homework and make sure that the schools in your new area are up to par with your current city. After all, you wouldn\u2019t want to move across the country only to realize that the school system is below average.\n\n3. Calculate the Cost of Living\n\nRelocating is an expensive undertaking, and a new city means different pricing on everyday staples like groceries, housing, electric etc. Before you accept a new position, you\u2019ll want to realistically calculate the cost of living in your new city. Take a look at apartments or houses in the area and make sure that they are within your budget. If your new salary doesn\u2019t cover the cost of living in your new area, you may want to reconsider your relocation.\n\n4. Don\u2019t Forget About Moving Expenses\n\nOftentimes a make or break aspect of relocating is whether or not your new company will cover your moving expenses. Atlas Van Lines reports that a single person moving from a one-bedroom, Los Angeles apartment to one in Chicago could spend approximately $2,240 for professional movers to load and unload a single mobile storage container. This cost can triple when you\u2019re talking about moving an entire 5-person household. If your company won\u2019t cover your expenses, experts suggest doing a cost-benefit analysis to weigh the professional opportunities as well as the financial sacrifices of your move.\n\n5. Weigh What the Day-To-Day Will Be Like\n\nAfter you\u2019ve checked in with your family, weighed the cost of living and factored in moving expenses, the last thing you\u2019ll want to consider is what your day-to-day will be like. Each city offers something a bit different and while you may love living in New York City, you may not enjoy Los Angeles or vice versa. You\u2019ll want to weigh factors like weather, commuting times, transportation options such as public transportation versus driving, and extracurricular opportunities in your new city. If you\u2019re really involved in a church group or an artist community in your current city, you\u2019ll want to make sure that you can find something comparable in your new city. You\u2019ll also want to make sure that if you are relocating away from friends and family that you and your own family will be okay during the transition. It takes awhile to make new friends and build relationships and if you\u2019re not prepared for it, it can make the move a lot harder.",

No one can blame you. The sunshine, fantastic beaches, diverse population, food, Hollywood, technology, and job opportunities are some of the amazing reasons to live there. But if there\u2019s one thing you should know it\u2019s that it\u2019s going to\u00a0cost you a lot.\n\nThe good news is not everything in California will dent your pocket. Here are the things you can enjoy in California at considerably lower prices:\n\n1. Furniture\n\nYup, California furniture can be inexpensive if you know how to look for the right shop. If you\u00a0head to furniture stores in Thousand Oaks\u00a0or anywhere in the state, you can spot a variety of pieces \u2014 from vintage to contemporary or even whimsical \u2014 at discounted prices.\n\n2. Housing\n\nTo be clear, California remains to have one of the most expensive housing costs in the country. When\u00a0compared to New York, however, it\u2019s 66% less. Overall, everything in NY is much costlier than California.\n\n3. Leisure\n\nFood and drink cost a lot in the state, and so does watching movies. However, when you have plenty of options, you have many ways to save on entertainment. Go to public beaches, attend festivals, or visit Los Angeles and\u00a0do all of its free activities.\n\n4. Gym Memberships\n\nWhether you love Planet Fitness or Gold\u2019s Gym, you can certainly find one in key cities and towns around the state. If you don\u2019t want to spend any money on a membership, go to the public beaches. Some have free gym installations for you to use anytime you like.\n\nMoving to California sure requires smart budgeting skills. Nevertheless, some things are affordable than other states. To top it off, the state \u2014 or at least most of its cities \u2014 offers high salaries. This should help offset the high cost of living. In the end, it\u2019s a win-win, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0\n\nScroll to Top",

        "text":"Best ear cleaner for Goldendoodles\n\nA Goldendoodle can be your best friend if you show your dog the love and affection that it deserves. However, you should commit to a Goldendoodle\u2014or any dog for that matter\u2014only when you\u2019re ready to take complete responsibility for it.\n\n\nIn a Hurry? Here are Our Top Choices\n\nPrices and images pulled from the Amazon Product Advertising API on:\n\n\nSo, are you ready to take responsibility for a Goldendoodle? This can be a tricky question to answer. Before they get a Goldendoodle home, many people assume that they are ready to take care of it. However, after these people bring the dog home, reality dawns on them, and they start to realize that taking care of a dog entails a lot more than just being affectionate towards it. They begin to understand that a lot of effort and hard work are needed to take care of the dog and keep it happy.\n\n\nIf given love and properly taken care of, a Goldendoodle can be many things, including a guardian for your home, a friend for your children, and a devoted companion for the other pets in your home. However, you must make sure that you have the money, time, and willingness to take care of a Goldendoodle\u2019s need before you bring it home.\n\n\nWhy Maintaining the Hygiene of Your Goldendoodle is Critical?\n\nIf you don\u2019t properly take care of the Goldendoodle, then it can get injured or fall sick due to poor hygiene, the wrong diet, and unhealthy living conditions. Maintaining the hygiene of your Goldendoodle is especially important because Goldendoodles are known to quickly develop health problems if they are not regularly groomed and properly taken care of.\n\n\nThe grooming needs of the Goldendoodle include brushing the dog, trimming its nails, cleaning its ears, and, if necessary, clipping its coat. Although most dogs aren\u2019t fond of it, bathing your dog is important for keeping its skin and coat healthy. Also, a regularly bathed dog is free of dirt and parasites. A Goldendoodle needs to be bathed more than once a month to maintain the health of its skin and coat.\n\n\nIn addition to bathing your Goldendoodle regularly, you need to perform regular inspection of your dog\u2019s ear. If too much wax builds in your Goldendoodle\u2019s ears, then this can lead to an ear infection. However, the wax does not build up overnight. Instead, it builds up over time. Therefore, wax build-up in your Goldendoodle\u2019s ears can be prevented with regular inspection and cleaning of the ears.\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t checked your Goldendoodle\u2019s ears for a while and suspect that it might have an ear infection, then check if your dog\u2019s ears exude a bad smell. If they do stink, then this may be a sign of an ear infection. Since an ear infection can lead to several complications in your Goldendoodle, you should look to prevent it. This can be achieved with the best ear cleaner for Goldendoodles.\n\n\nHow to Find an Effective Ear Cleaner for Your Goldendoodle\n\nWhen choosing an ear cleaner for your Goldendoodle, the first and foremost thing that you should look to ensure is that the cleaner is made from soothing and natural ingredients. However, this is not the only thing you should consider in order to find the best ear cleaner for your Goldendoodle.\n\n\nYou also need to consider how much time it takes for the ear cleaning product to work or take effect. Choosing an ear cleaner that acts fast is important because an ear infection can be an irritating and painful experience for your dog.\n\n\nThere are some ear cleaners that will solve the ear infection problem in three days, and there are others that take up to a week to work. So, find out how much time an ear cleaner takes to take effect before using it on your Goldendoodle.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, you must choose an ear cleaner with soothing and natural ingredients. This means that the ear cleaner should be free from any chemical or other harmful substances that can cause a burning sensation in your dog\u2019s ears. Therefore, looking for an ear cleaner that is made using natural products such as Aloe Vera.\n\n\nAnother important aspect to consider when choosing an ear cleaner for your dog is the cleaner\u2019s smell. An ear infection can cause a stinky smell in your Goldendoodle\u2019s ears. However, by using an ear cleaner with a clean and fresh smell, you can mask the bad odor emanating from your dog\u2019s ear due to the infection.\n\n\nLastly, determine how often you want to use the ear cleaner on your Goldendoodle. This is because some products required you to use ear cleaner once a day while others need to be used twice a day. The less often you have to use the ear cleaner, the less often you will have to struggle with your Goldendoodle to make it sit. So, choose sensibly.\n\n\nThe Top 3 Ear Cleaners for Goldendoodles\n\nIn the previous section, we looked at the various factors to consider in order to find the best ear cleaner for Goldendoodles.

        "text":"Cleaning Mistakes That Could Be Wasting Your Time\n\nCleaning Mistakes That Could Be Wasting Your Time\n\nCleaning Mistakes That Could Be Wasting Your Time\n\nCleaning is a mandatory task that every person needs to do in order to keep their houses clean and fresh for them to live in. And when we want to clean, we probably all want to do it as fast as possible, so that we can save time for something else that we really enjoy. However, when it comes to cleaning, there are some common cleaning habits that could make us spend more time than needed. Sometimes due to the habit or old methods, we double our work and cause more harm than good. So, here we present you cleaning mistakes that could be wasting your time.\n\n1. Forgetting to clean your appliances\n\nMost of the time, when we clean our rooms or any other things (clothes, dishes, etc.), we use cleaning appliances, such as dishwashers, washing machines or vacuum cleaners. Once we finished using them, we just store them and that\u2019s it. We forget about the fact that these appliances also need to be cleaned. If you do not clean it periodically, all the dirt residues can build up, and can cause an unpleasant odor. Moreover, if you don\u2019t take care of your appliances, they can break down, and you will have to invest in a new one. In order to avoid that, don\u2019t forget to clean them.\n\nCleaning Mistakes That Could Be Wasting Your Time appliances\n\n2. Using dirty cleaning cloths\n\nThis is a common mistake that many people don\u2019t realize can ruin their cleaning time. When you want to clean your kitchen counters or windows, and you use a dirty rag, you will only get them dirty. Furthermore, you could be spreading bacteria or germs around your home, and this is potentially harmful for yours and your family\u2019s health. So, always remind yourself, that if you are going to clean, you need to bring clean cloths. Also, make sure you are using the right type of cloths, that will help you clean easily.\n\n3. Cleaning with the right products\n\nCleaning Mistakes That Could Be Wasting Your Time right products\n\nLet\u2019s imaging you are moving out of your place, so you want to clean your old residence. You only go to the nearest supermarket and buy the most popular cleaning product in Chicago. Then, you begin cleaning with it, and later you realize that it has caused more damage than good to our place. How so? Because you didn\u2019t pick the right cleaning products for your cleaning time. This can happen, specially, if you are an amateur in these matters. So, you need to make sure you are picking the right one. Sometimes it is better to hire a Move Out Cleaning Chicago. This service has an extensive knowledge of these products, and it will help you to pick the one your place needs.\n\n4. Not Cleaning from Top to Bottom\n\nWhen you want to clean, and save as much time as you can because you are moving out really soon, then you need to follow this simple instruction: Clean from top to bottom. It may sound easy to do, but some people tend to forget it. They start the cleaning process in any place, not having something schedule. And once they have finished, and the time of moving out has come, they realize that the place is not completely clean, as there can be some crumbs and dust onto the freshly-cleaned floor. So, it is better to adopt this habit of cleaning from top to bottom. Actually, most move out cleaning services Chicago do it this way. So, if a professional does it, why not you? Of course, this advice is useful in any cleaning situation, whether you are moving out or not.\n\n5. Scrubbing instead of blotting your carpets\n\nJust think about the moment you spill something over your carpet. When that happens, you just immediately start scrubbing the fresh carpet stain and think that is enough to clean it.\n\nHowever, instead of fixing the situation, you only end up spreading the stain and also damaging the fibers of it. To avoid this situation of ruining your favorite carpet, what you need to do instead is blot it. This blotting process is better at absorbing the moisture and color of any stain, and it does not cause any damage to the carpet.\n\nFor that, remember to use many clean cloths to soak up the stain. Let them absorb all the moisture. Once that is over, you can begin thinking about the process of removing a carpet stain. If you are not sure about how to do it, you can call an apartment cleaning Chicago, that can offer you this service as well.\n\nCleaning Mistakes That Could Be Wasting Your Time carpets\n\n6. Leaving the vacuum bag dirty\n\nThe invention of the vacuum cleaner has certainly eased you many exhausting chores a little. Instead of using your broom, a vacuum cleaner works quickly and more efficiently. So, it is certainly a great help. But once you have used it, you just store it until the next time. This is a mistake that you should not do it. Imagine you want to use it another time, but find the vacuum bag full of dust and dirt. It won\u2019t pick up much dirt. Likewise, it can blow out some dirt from inside. Instead of being of great help, it can ruin your cleaning day. Then, do not forget to clean out your vacuum cleaner bag frequently to keep it in a great condition. It will only take you two minutes to empty the bag.\n\nClean your house the right way!\n\nAs you can see, there are some mistakes that people tend to do when cleaning their places. Most of them are done due to old habits (that we know can be hard to erase). But if you follow these tips, you will notice how fast you can clean your place and how easy it will turn it to be. On the other hand, if you feel like cleaning is too much of a job, you can perfectly ask for a residential or apartment cleaning in Chicago. With their trained staff, it is certain that they won\u2019t make these mistakes, and you can be happy to leave your place in good hands. Furthermore, you can also ask them any advice on how to clean small parts of your house. Just learn from the best.",

        "text":"Easy Crops to Grow From Seed\n\nIf you're planting a garden for the first time, it's good to know what vegetables are generally easiest to grow from seed. Don't be afraid to challenge yourself with more advanced vegetables, but remember that most beginning gardeners have a steep learning curve. Also, remember that pest and disease pressures vary greatly from region to region, and that climactic differences make crops that are difficult in one place easy to grow in another. This list is based primarily on gardening in central Virginia, where we're located. One criteria we've used in making this list is that all the crops on it are suitable for sowing directly into your garden. Some are also suitable for transplanting. See our Vegetable Growing Guides for crop-specific growing instructions.\n\nMinor crops that are also easy to grow from seed include salsify, upland cress, arugula, malabar spinach, luffa gourds, anise-hyssop, and basil.\n\nQueen Anne Blackeye Pea Belle Isle Upland Cress Amber Globe turnip Sugar Ann pea\n\nLettuce can be sown directly in your garden bed, or started indoors for transplanting. It's one of the few crops that can be grown all year in our climate, but in hot weather it should be shaded and harvested at smaller sizes.\n\nSnap, snow, and shelling peas are all best sown as early as the soil can be worked in spring. You can eat your pea shoots and flowers as well! Taller varieties should be supported with a trellis or by planting along a fence.\n\nSalad radishes can be harvested in as little as 24 days after planting, and can be inter-planted with slower-growing vegetables. Winter storage radishes will keep for months in the fridge or root cellar. You can plant radishes as soon as you can work the soil in the spring.\n\nTurnips produce abundant harvests even in small spaces.\n\nBeans can bear well even in relatively poor soils, thanks to the nitrogen-fixing microbes they associate with. Bush varieties don't require trellising, but pole varieties provide a more extended harvest. In cool areas, snap beans are easiest. In hot areas, lima beans, southern peas, and asparagus beans are also very easy to grow.\n\nFast-growing, fun, and kid-friendly, sunflowers are among the most popular flowers. Other easy flowers to grow include zinnias, marigolds and cosmos.\n\nTahitian Melon squash Inca Jewels Sunflower Beck's Big Buck okra Tatsoi mustard\n\nSweet Potatoes\nSweet potatoes grow vigorously in warm weather. The tubers can be stored for months at room temperature. We ship sweet potato slips in late spring, separately from other items. Be sure to plant them soon after they arrive.\n\nWinter Squash, including Pumpkins\nFast-growing squash plants are fairly easy to keep weeded. You can harvest all your winter squash at once. Look for (C. moschata) after the variety name in our catalog or on our website, especially if you're in the South. These varieties are the most resistant to squash vine borers. Very young squash plants may need protection from cucumber beetles; garden blankets are a good protection option. You can also cook and eat the young leaves, growing tips, and flowers of your squash plants.\n\nIf your climate has enough heat, okra plants will get huge and provide you with lots of tender young pods. Harvest every day or every other day wearing long sleeves.\n\nWe've had chard plants last for a year-and-a-half on our farm when there's been a mild winter. Stems and leaves can both be cooked. Tender young leaves can be used in salads.\n\nKale tolerates an impressive range of temperatures and is sweetest after frost. It can be harvested at many different stages, and the buds and flowers are edible, too! Mustards and collards are closely related to kale and are also easy to grow.\n\nThough it grows slowly in cold weather, spinach is probably the easiest vegetable to grow through the winter.",

        "text":"DIY Green Home Solutions\n\nPune posted on 08.02.2017\n\n\nStore-bought cleaners seem harmless as they take up cabinet space in our laundry rooms and bathroom closets, in our kitchens and broom closets. Yet, many household products including room fresheners, detergents and scrubs can be dangerously toxic. Many of them contain harmful substances such as Phthalates, PERC and Triclosan. This is why everyone should start making their own Green Home Solutions. Here are 5 ideas for DIY green home solutions\n\n\n  1. Make your own compost\n\nYou only need to invest in bins and a little bit of time to get your own compost going.\u00a0 To make your own compost invest in two large bins. Get started with the first bin, and layer your organic kitchen waste, garden clippings, dry leaves and shredded paper with a bit of soil. Keep stirring occasionally. When you are done with the first bin, move to the second bin. When the contents of your first bin resemble a crumbly soil, it is ready to be used as humus, or garden supplement.\n\nThe results are many, including rich manure that you can use to grow your own organic vegetables and fruits, even on a small balcony garden! I recently chanced upon a lovely book by Doring Kingsley publishers titled \u201cGardening in Urban India\u201d It\u2019s a lovely step-by-step guide and every urban Indian home can benefit from referring to it. When you have healthy plants, the air that you breathe is also purified naturally. Make sure you have a lot of indoor plants too.\n\n\n2. Make your cleaning agents at home\n\nVinegar, baking soda and lime are my go-to cleaning agents. Apart from being green, they also clean beautifully. Here are a few recipes that will help you manage without store-bought cleaners\n\nTo mop your floors\n\nMix the following;\n\n1 cup vinegar and 2-3 drops of essential oil (lemon works well) stirred into a pocha bucket half-filled with warm water.\n\n\nTo clean windows and glasses\nMix the following:\n2 cups water, \u00bd cup vinegar, \u00bc cup rubbing alcohol and 1-2 drops of essential oil.\nFill this in a spray bottle and clean glasses with it.\n\nFor ovens or stove tops\nMix 2-3 spoons of baking soda with warm water in a small container. Pour this mixture onto a soft cloth, and wipe. For stubborn stains, pour the liquid directly on the stain and keep for 10 minutes, then wipe off.\n\nYou can also make everything from laundry detergent to handwash at home using Castille soap which is easily available on the online stores in India. Lookout for recipes using these ingredients, and make what works for you.\n\n\n3. Polish your brass the green way\n\nIn a bottle, throw in used lime peels as and when you get them. Sprinkle salt on top of each layer. Keep the layers going until they line the top of the bottle. Now shake well, and gather up all the brass in your home. Scrub the surface of each brass object with a salty lemon peel, then rinse and wipe dry with a soft cloth. Your brass will be clean and shiny, with no chemical cleaners!\n\n4. Homemade room fresheners\n\nIf you are used to reaching for a perfume spray, hold it. It\u2019s time to learn how to make your home smell fresh with scents you concoct yourself! You could use a diffuser with essential oils, or you could quickly make your own spray by mixing two or three essential oils with half a cup of water. Just fill it in a spray bottle and spray around the room. For a lovely aroma you could use an orange peel as a holder for a t-light candle, and revel in the citrusy fragrance that fills your home.\n\n5 Make recycling a habit\n\nTeach your kids by example. Old jeans should be either donated, or given a fresh lease of life by turning them into bags, and other creative things. Old bottles should be re-used as d\u00e9cor (painted accent pieces, lamps, etc.) or sent to a bottle re-cycling plant. Use products well, and dispose of them correctly. Get creative with old tyres, give furniture a new lease of life with decoupage or a fresh coat of paint. Make recycling a habit!\n\nGreen living should be a conscious, daily effort rather than something we just do once in a way. The benefit is for both you and the environment, and ultimately something that you can think of as a gift to the planet!\n\n\nAll Comments(0)",
