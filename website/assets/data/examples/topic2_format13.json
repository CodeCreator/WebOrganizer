Unreliable and untested software leads to unreliable results that cannot be trusted\u201d, states a recent report on opportunities to grow the UK\u2019s research capability. This report, produced by UK Research and Innovation, will be used to guide the UK government\u2019s strategy for research investment - which is planned to increase to at least 2.4% of Gross Domestic Product by 2027. This is possibly the first time such a high-profile report has clearly identified the critical role of software and the people who create it.\n\nThe report cites research from the Software Sustainability Institute on the prevalence of software in research\u00a0and notes that Research Software Engineers are \u201cparticularly critical\u201d in universities, research institutes and business. It shows the Institute at the heart of the UK\u2019s current national research and innovation e-infrastructure ecosystem (see Figure 17). Importantly, it supports plans for investment into software maintenance, which will \u201cenable the full value to be extracted from software throughout its lifetime\u201d, and a national facility of research software engineering, which could help broker access to skills across the UK.\n\nWe are incredibly pleased that this report recognises both\u00a0the critical role that software plays\u00a0in research\u00a0and that this\u00a0reliance on software necessitates\u00a0investment\u00a0to ensure\u00a0the quality and trustworthiness of research.\n\nFor more information, see chapter 8 of the report (starting on page 114).",

Minetest takes cross-platform compatibility seriously and hadn\u2019t yet moved to C++11 due to missing official support from Debian GNU\/Linux. Following release of Debian 8, Minetest moves to C++11, with all features of the language standard taken into use.\n\nThe tagline of Minetest at this point is \u201cWait, is it an engine or a game?\u201d, and we have no answer. Reaching the founder Perttu \u201cceleron55\u2033 Ahola for an answer results in weird horn and fart noises.\n\nMinetest consists of a native core written in C++, on top of which content is written in Lua and published as independent releases. Minetest can be played and developed for fun, and welcomes contributors to all of its components.\n\nThe Minetest community can be found on the official Minetest discussion board at forum.minetest.net (https:\/\/forum.minetest.net\/), and a changelog of the continuing 0.5 changes can be found on the Minetest developer wiki (http:\/\/dev.minetest.net\/Changelog#0.4.16_.E2.86.92_0.5.x_.2830_Aug.29).\n\n\nAlso on minds.com: https:\/\/www.minds.com\/blog\/view\/754774999667056642\n\n2 Responses to \u201cPRESS RELEASE: Minetest 0.5 has begun development!\u201d\n\n  1. SovR3dBit Says:\n\n    Cool, moving to C++11 thats very cool\n\n  2. afree2004 lil Says:\n\n    Great job! I love minetest.

Highlights from\u00a0the\u00a0infrastructure work include\u00a0refactoring the entire setup and upgrade code, removing the mix of perl and bash, into a new python library. We are also investigating the standardization on a C++14 compliant compiler across all platforms for the support of the new rule engine plugin.\n\nWorking Group Call for Participation\n\nThe iRODS Consortium Technology Working Group has identified several important topics that have broad impact, both on grant-funded projects\u00a0in the academic arena, as well as on new and existing users from the community. These\u00a0working groups would work to gather use cases, examine existing implementations, and synthesize standards and best practices around which the iRODS Consortium may provide packaged reference implementations.\n\n  1. Mime Types\n  2. Persistent Identifiers\n  3. Enterprise Message Bus (EMB)\n  4. Services related to\u00a0the EMB\u00a0such as:\n    1. Auditing Framework\n    2. Notifications\n\nOnce participants have been identified, we expect each working group to meet for hour-long web conferences about every two weeks for a span of approximately 3 months. We will\u00a0begin by hosting presentations from our collaborators to examine existing production implementations. \u00a0Ultimately, our desired outcomes are documentation\u00a0and\u00a0decisions on: message formats, schemas, serialization technology,\u00a0topics and associated services, expected control flow from clients through iRODS to and from these services, and potential new API calls from iRODS to support new functionality.\n\nIf you are interested in playing a role in these discussions, please email\u00a0referencing any or all working groups you would like to join.\n\nJason Coposky",

        "text":"SemanticMerge goes Visual\n\nWednesday, July 24, 2013 , 0 Comments\n\nEdit:Thanks to Scott Hanselman and Jon Skeet for sharing the launch on Twitter.\n\nHere we are, releasing again! Doing our best to follow the rule of \u201crelease early, release often\u201d.\n\nToday we\u2019re publishing our latest feature in SemanticMerge: the \u201cVisual Merge\u201d. And since picture is worth a thousand words\u2026 here you are:\n\nWe\u2019ve also added \u201cdifference rendering\u201d to the SemanticDiff tool, so it is possible to use the new visual functionality not only during merge but also while looking for differences, which is a much more common operation:\n\nYou can download SemanticMerge, including Visual Merge and Visual Diff at It is available for C#, Java, and soon it will support C and JavaScript too. Don\u2019t forget to follow us @semanticmerge\n\n\nThe full story behind visual conflict rendering\n\nAt the very beginning we explained semantic with diagrams like this:\n\nWe wanted to explain how something as complex as splitting a class into two different ones in parallel could be easily merged by SemanticMerge. Using figures (and Visio) was the better way we had.\n\nSoon we started thinking on how cool it would be to teach Semantic to render the conflicts...\n\nIt is all about the icons\n\nIf you ever used SemanticMerge or if you visited the website then you\u2019ve seen the way in which we render the conflicts:\n\nAs you can see each method in conflict is decorated with icons representing the type of change: \u201cc\u201d stands for changed, \u201cm\u201d for moved, \u201cd\u201d deleted and \u201ca\u201d added (we also use \u201cr\u201d for renamed as a special \u201cmoved\u201d case).\n\nIcons on the left mean differences with \u201csource contributor\u201d and the ones on the right mean differences with the \u201cdestination contributor\u201d considering contributors as in the following picture:\n\nThe whole idea of putting the icons on the left and the right of the method came from this graphic (again powered by Visio):\n\nHence, when a method in the shape in the middle (ancestor or base) has icons at both sides it means it has a conflict. If it only has one icon it means it only has changes in one of the two contributors, so the merge will be automatic, and if it has no icons it means it was unchanged.\n\nThis is the idea behind the entire GUI and as you can see now, the originally Visio-drawn concept grew up to become a full GUI.\n\nSome VisualMerge images\n\nThese are some of the merges you can display if you just install SemanticMerge and go to the samples directory.\n\nDivergent move\n\nThis is the \u201cSocket Deeper\u201d example, in C# and rendering \u201chiding unchanged nodes\u201d which greatly simplifies the entire graphic:\n\nGroup unchanged\n\nNow an example, this time in Java, grouping unchanged parts:\n\nThe State of the Art of Merge Technology\n\nWe\u2019ve recently posted what can be currently achieved chaining SemanticMerge into an advanced merge toolchain, which maybe is somehint you\u2019re interested on :P\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nStay tuned because next week we will come up with a top request in our UserVoice :P\n\n0 comentarios:",

        "text":"BlackBerry PlayBook SDK\n\n* Updated: See official Press Release below! *\n\nSince the announcement of the BlackBerry PlayBook many folks have been waiting to get a deeper look into what, exactly can be done with the device. App developers especially. Now, the BlackBerry PlayBook SDK for Adobe AIR app creation has been released and alongside it are the downloads for the simulators (Windows and Mac versions) for both. Of course, Research In Motion have marked both as beta's so you'll have to keep that in mind when exploring. We'll hopefully see plenty of updates for it over time but, for now this is the start of something good. Now, be honest. How many of you all are gonna download the simulator just to see what's up?\n\nPress Release\n\nNew SDK From RIM Allows Developers to Create Adobe AIR Applications for BlackBerry PlayBook\n\n- SDK integrates new extensions for Adobe AIR that have been highly optimized for the BlackBerry Tablet OS\n\n- Developers can immediately begin building uncompromised applications for the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet\n\n- Early feedback from developers highlights ease of development and high performance\n\nWATERLOO, ONTARIO--(Marketwire - Oct. 25, 2010) - Research In Motion (RIM) (NASDAQ:RIMM)(TSX:RIM) today launched the new BlackBerry(R) Tablet OS SDK for Adobe(R) AIR(R) at the Adobe MAX conference in Los Angeles. The new Software Developer Kit (SDK) enables developers to quickly and easily create AIR applications for the BlackBerry(R) PlayBook(TM) tablet using Adobe's powerful, familiar and industry-leading development tools. With the BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR, developers can leverage the uniquely powerful capabilities of the BlackBerry Tablet OS, as well as access all of the richness of Adobe AIR, to deliver incredibly engaging and high-performing AIR applications for the BlackBerry PlayBook.\n\n\"The BlackBerry PlayBook, with its dual-core processor and multi-processing OS, is a multi-tasking powerhouse that is also the world's first tablet to be built from the metal up to run Flash Player 10.1 and Adobe AIR applications in a fully integrated, fully optimized fashion,\" said David Yach, Chief Technology Officer, Software, Research In Motion. \"The new SDK for the BlackBerry PlayBook unleashes a wealth of opportunity for the Adobe and BlackBerry development communities to easily create value-added applications and experiences for customers and we are extremely excited by the positive feedback received from developers in early trials.\"\n\nThe BlackBerry PlayBook with BlackBerry Tablet OS supports Adobe AIR 2.5 and Adobe Flash(R) Player 10.1 at its core. This integrated support and the BlackBerry PlayBook's exceptional processing power (including a 1 GHz dual-core processor, true symmetric multiprocessing and multi-threaded rendering) give developers the ability to deliver incredibly rich content and applications with highly-responsive and fluid touch screen experiences.\n\n\"The close collaboration between RIM and the Adobe AIR team has achieved an implementation which we expect to be the first to include high performance optimizations for tablet devices,\" said David Wadhwani, senior vice president, Creative and Interactive Business Solutions at Adobe. \"This, combined with great tooling integration and full Flash Player 10.1 support, makes the BlackBerry PlayBook an outstanding platform for more than three million Flash developers.\"\n\nBuilding the Best Flash\/AIR Applications for Tablet Computing\n\nRIM has designed the BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR to allow developers to leverage the uniquely powerful capabilities of the BlackBerry PlayBook and Adobe AIR 2.5 to build industry-leading applications that provide a distinctly compelling experience for BlackBerry PlayBook users. The new SDK provides developers with support for:\n\n-- Hardware-accelerated playback of video and graphics-intensive content,\nboth in the browser and within AIR applications, enabling a smooth, high\nfidelity viewing experience on the BlackBerry PlayBook, even with up to\n1080p HD content\n\n-- Web View to enable AIR apps to display HTML and Flash content and to\nleverage the BlackBerry PlayBook's WebKit browser\n\n-- UI components that have been built specifically for the touch screen\nexperience on a tablet device, including support for multi-touch and\n\n-- Powerful APIs to advanced features such as the front and rear facing\ncameras, accelerometer, geo-location, in-app payments and more\n\n-- Application notifications, which allow developers to bring events\ngenerated by AIR applications immediately to the user's attention, even\nif the application is running in the background\n\n-- Seamless communication between AIR apps on the BlackBerry PlayBook,\nallowing the creation of \"Super App\" experiences\n\n-- Extending Adobe AIR applications to use native C++ extensions, providing\ndevelopers with the ability to write part of their application in the\nBlackBerry Tablet OS's native code (subject to availability of the\nupcoming BlackBerry Tablet OS native SDK)\n\n-- Porting existing Adobe AIR applications quickly and easily to the\nBlackBerry PlayBook\n\nWhat Developers are Saying about Building Flash\/AIR Apps for BlackBerry PlayBook\n\nSeveral BlackBerry(R) Alliance members are already working with the BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR as part of an early access program.\n\n\"eUnity enables health care professionals to access and manipulate full quality medical images from a Flash-enabled web browser,\" said Steve Rankin, President and CEO of Client Outlook. \"Bringing our application to the tablet form factor for the first time was incredibly fast and easy using the BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR. In fact we had eUnity running on the BlackBerry PlayBook in less than 2 hours! We are excited about the opportunity to access our innovative server technology through the power of Flash to provide our healthcare clientele with the ability to dynamically interact with diagnostic images that render amazingly fast, on an ultra portable device.\"\n\n\"With help from Adobe's development tools we've been able to create an exceptional eReading application that will be pre-loaded on the BlackBerry PlayBook,\" said Dan Leibu, CTO of Kobo. \"The SDK enabled us to achieve the right level of performance for the delivery of rich reading content and a world-class reading experience.\"\n\n\"Mobile and social technologies are the future of enterprise computing,\" said Kendall Collins, chief marketing officer, \"The BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR will enable us to seamlessly deliver real-time collaboration with Chatter Mobile to business users around the world on the BlackBerry PlayBook.\"\n\n\"SAP customers want to free their SAP(R) applications from the confines of the desktop and truly mobilize their workforces,\" said Nicholas Brown, senior vice president, Mobility Market Development, SAP AG. \"Analytic dashboards are a clear use case in which everyone from the C-level executive to line-of-business manager to sales rep can analyze and access information in real time. The BlackBerry PlayBook SDK for Adobe AIR made it incredibly easy for us to build applications using Flash development tools - it took our developers just a couple of days to convert an existing SAP application into an AIR application for BlackBerry PlayBook. It looks impressive and most importantly is incredible easy to use on the new tablet.\"\n\n\"The BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR, allowed us to create a highly engaging experience utilizing existing coding knowledge, which makes creating PlayBook applications extremely fast,\" said Brett Cortese, CEO, Universal Mind, Inc. \"We simply dropped the SDK into Flash Builder and the controls were available and the ball was rolling.\"\n\nGetting Started\n\nAdobe AIR developers can start building their applications for BlackBerry PlayBook today and will be able to submit their AIR applications for BlackBerry PlayBook to BlackBerry App World(TM) later this year. The BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR and the BlackBerry PlayBook simulator are both currently available in beta and can be downloaded for free from\n\nDevelopers at Adobe MAX interested in learning about development opportunities for BlackBerry PlayBook can stop by RIM's booth #107. Attendees can also join in on a series of RIM-hosted sessions at the show focused on how to start developing AIR applications and web content for the BlackBerry Tablet OS.\n\nThe first webcast of a five week series hosted by RIM and Adobe experts will start on November 4, 2010 and will provide developers the opportunity to learn more about creating Adobe AIR applications for the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet.

        "text":"New Release -- 0.11\n\n  \u2022 It's time once again for your friendly neighborhood MythTV update. Changes to the TV portion include:\n    \u2022 New automatic deletion support (keep a certain number of episodes per program, or just free up space globally) to make sure you've got free space to record.\n    \u2022 A new live tv -> recording -> live tv transition contributed by Holger Buchfink, which fixes a number of bugs related to that. He also sent in a bunch of other bugfixes.\n    \u2022 DVB support is getting closer to 'working well' status, thanks mostly to fixes from Kenneth Aafloy and myself. Apparently it's useable for recording and (mostly) watching live tv, but there's some setup issues that should get worked out soon.\n    \u2022 This release includes very preliminary support for the (not yet shipping) pcHDTV card.\n    \u2022 The built-in transcoding support (just .nuv to .nuv, really) written by Geoffrey Hausheer finally got enabled. Basically, this allows you to recompress recorded files down to a smaller size for archival purposes. Or, just use mythmkmovie to transcode them into any other format you want (with some caveats).\n    \u2022 There's some preliminary native lirc (no more irxevent) support contributed by Scott Beck and Anduin Withers.\n    \u2022 Many bugfixes, optimizations (mpeg2 decoding is faster), and other improvements everywhere in MythTV.\n  \u2022 The rest of the plugin modules also saw quite a bit of development:\n    \u2022 Brand new 'MythDVD' module, which allows you to view DVDs using the DVD player software of your choice, as well as a frontend to transcode\/libdvdread for extremely easy movie backups which get automatically imported into MythVideo.\n    \u2022 A complete rewrite of MythWeb by Chris Petersen. While it doesn't quite (yet) match all the features of the old MythWeb, it will soon and is really quite nice =) The old code is still available in the CVS tree as the 'mythweb' module if people still want to use that.\n    \u2022 MythGame got a much needed user interface overhaul. It now matches the other UIs in MythTV.\n    \u2022 MythWeather got fixed -- a lot of people were seeing the weather forcast data collection process time out or error out. Welp, no more of that. =)\n  \u2022 As always, quite a few people contributed to this release. Thanks everyone!\n  \u2022 As always, grab things from the download section and read the documentation. Make sure to read the various UPGRADING files if you're upgrading from an earlier release.\n  \u2022 Check the links section for Debian, Redhat, and Mandrake package updates. Hopefully they'll all be available soon =) I can't imagine the official Gentoo ebuild taking that long to update to 0.11 either.\n  \u2022 And just a note to anyone who's wondering -- XMLTV 0.5.16 was released recently to fix a temporary problem with tv_grab_na. This MythTV release is of course compatible with it, 0.5.15, and 0.5.14, so use whatever you want.\nPosted by Isaac on August 15th 2003",
