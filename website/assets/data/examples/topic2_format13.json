Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school\n\nSince its inception in 2005, the program has brought together over 10,900 successful student participants from over 103 countries worldwide and over 500 open source organizations, all for the love of code.\u00a0\n\nThis is our 9th time participating in the program and we are pretty excited about it. We value the participation in the program since it allows us to meet and discuss ideas with smart students from around the world. The past years brought great results, such as the Solr Search, WebDAV and RESTful remote access APIs, the Office importer, and the XEclipse project, just to name a few.\n\nThis year we're proposing a lot of interesting projects, so make sure you check them out and send your proposals.\n\nThe student application period will last from March 14 until March 25.

        "text":"Will The Real In-Memory Database Please Stand Up? Report Examines IMDS Claims\n\nIn-memory database systems (IMDSs) have changed the software landscape, making it possible to deploy \"\"smarter\"\" real-time devices and applications on QNX operating systems and sparking mergers and acquisitions involving the largest technology companies.\nBut these days, the database sector teems with products purporting to be IMDSs. The problem is, most of them aren't. The majority of products promoted as in-memory databases are merely old-style (on-disk) DBMSs, wearing a thin coat of IMDS paint.\nMcObject's new white paper, \"\"Will the Real IMDS Please Stand Up\"\", explains how to tell the difference between real and imitation in-memory database systems, and explains why it matters. This report is available for free download from McObject's Web site.\nIMDSs provide the features of traditional database management systems (DBMSs)--including transactions, multi-user concurrency control, and high level data definition and querying languages--but with a key difference: in-memory databases store records in main memory, eliminating disk storage and related overhead. This enables IMDSs to offer faster performance as well as a more streamlined design and smaller code size.\nBut today, IMDSs' popularity has sparked a flurry of products falsely claiming to be in-memory database systems. Understanding the distinction is critical for potential users whose problem domain is best served by the technology. The differences can affect the hardware requirements (and therefore total cost of ownership), performance, time-to-revenue, and ultimately the success or failure of a solution.\nDistinguishing between real and fake IMDSs often means examining the key areas of origins and wholeness. The origins of a purported IMDS can point to whether the product is truly optimized for in-memory use, and reveal whether performance-sapping \"\"artifacts\"\" remain from its original design as an on-disk DBMS. Wholeness asks the question, does this product offer a complete set of DBMS features? Developers and end-users shouldn't have to settle for less.\nProspective users can download McObject's free \"\"Will the Real IMDS Please Stand Up\"\" to help gauge whether they will obtain the hallmark IMDS benefits of fast performance and superior database efficiency from specific vendors and products often described as (or purporting to be) in memory database systems.\nDownload the report now.\n\nAbout McObject\nFounded by embedded database and real-time systems experts, McObject offers proven data management technology that makes applications and devices smarter, more reliable and more cost-effective to develop and maintain.
