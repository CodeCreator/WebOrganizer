The body is painted black with a grey abdomen and yellow, brown and white stripes on the legs, arms and chest. An inscription on the square, flat base of the carving reads \"Ada Panunga \/ Nov '96 \/ 33-1196 \/ 500\".\n\nStatement of significance\n\nThis collection consists of three sculptures made during the 1990s by artists at the Ngkawenyerre camp in the Utopia homelands, NT. They are in good condition, similar in size and made of synthetic polymer paint on wood. One figure, by an unknown artist, is possibly a youth painted up before becoming a man, [65.0 x 15.0 x 11.0 cm]. The other two figures, one by Ada Panunga [45.5 x 15.0 x 15.0 cm] and the other by Lucky Kngwarreye Morton [67.0 x 15.5 x 16.0 cm] are decorated with 'Awelye', significant ceremonial designs the women paint on their breasts. The associated ceremonies are an integral part of community life and the 'Awelye' is performed by women to ensure the fertility of the land, health, happiness and social harmony.\n\nThe people of Utopia have a strong tradition of carving and their work is well represented in Australian museum collections. The craft is practised by both men and women. These three sculptures, collected in the1990s, are seminal works representing a significant departure from traditional forms and methods of carving. They are significant as examples illustrating the introduction of modern tools and use of acrylic paint to decorate sculptures. The sculptures also provide a new vehicle for the recording of traditional ceremonial designs such as 'Awelye'.\n\nObject information\n\nBack to top",

At 19 his knowledge of Chinese painting was formed when he enrolled at Zhejiang Provincial Teachers\u2019 College in Hangzhou, where he studied with the famous scholars and painters Jing Hengyi and Li Shutong. Like most students of the time, Pan participated in student parades and shared the revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth Movement in 1919.\n\nPan began his career teaching Chinese painting in 1923, when he moved to Shanghai to accept an assignment. In that same year, he met the 80-year-old master of the Shanghai school, Wu Changshuo, and the two painters became intimate friends. They often discussed painting and calligraphy and Wu gave the younger artist continuous support and encouragement. Pan\u2019s style during this period can be traced back to a variety of Chinese masters, including the Ma-Xia tradition of Southern Song, the Wu and Zhe schools of the Ming dynasty, and the Qing master Bada Shanren.\n\nIn 1928 he left Shanghai for Hangzhou to teach at the newly established Hangzhou National Art College. Throughout subsequent decades he would devote himself to teaching at a series of art schools and associations, including the Zhejian Academy of Fine Arts.\n\nUnder the pressure of tremendous Western influences on Chinese painting development, Pan was concerned about the conflicts and interchanges between foreign and traditional elements in Chinese painting. To this end, in 1932 he and his friends set up a traditional Chinese painting society, Bai she (\u201cWhite Society\u201d), which aimed to develop Chinese painting in the reforming spirit of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou of the Qing dynasty. He argued that Chinese and Western art were derived from two totally different perspectives and therefore should remain distinct; any compromise between the two would weaken each tradition\u2019s unique nature. In his own teaching, he included Chinese traditions of calligraphy, seal carving, and literature. After 1949, art academies of the new China adopted the style of Socialist Realism, and Pan\u2019s insistence on the traditional inheritance became unpopular.\n\nPan\u2019s style took shape in the 1940s and gained full maturity in the mid-1950s. He successfully integrated the traditional subjects of flower-and-bird painting and landscape. Like Wu Changshuo, he applied the aesthetics of calligraphy and seal carving to his painting; but, unlike Wu, he adopted and advanced the forcefulness and heaviness of the Zhe school. His compositions were often dynamic, seeming to balance extreme opposing forces and thus evoking a feeling of danger. His brush was powerful and expressive, inducing a sense of thrill in the viewer.\n\nIn 1962 Pan held an individual exhibition at the newly founded Chinese Art Museum in Beijing, exhibiting 90 works of painting, seal carving, and calligraphy. Soon after the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1965, however, Pan began to be persecuted, and continued to be until his death in 1971.\n\nLearn More in these related articles:\n\nWu Changshuo\nSeptember 12, 1844 Anji county, Zhejiang, China November 6, 1927 Shanghai Chinese seal carver, painter, and calligrapher who was prominent in the early 20th century. ...\nRead This Article\nEight Eccentrics of Yangzhou\nChinese painters who worked in the area of Yangzhou, in Jiangsu province, during the Qianlong era (1735\u201396) of the Qing dynasty.

        "text":"Design Dictionary: Toile\n\nDesign Dictionary: Toile\n\nCarolyn Purnell\nSep 20, 2012\n\nIn today's parlance, toile, which is shorthand for \"toile de Jouy\" (pronounced \"twal-da-'zhwee\") generally refers to a finely detailed, scenic or storylike pattern printed in a single color. Its themes often revolve around pastoral life, recreation, and the pleasures of the seasons.\n\nAt its inception in the eighteenth century, the term referred simply to the cloth made at the royal manufactory in Jouy-de-Josas, in France, which was established in 1760 by Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf in order to make printed cotton cloths that could compete with the influx of imported Indian chintzes. The factory began making block prints, like the one you see in Image 3, moved to printing with the use of copper plates in the 1770s, and then switched to printing with copper rollers in 1797 (as in Image 4).\n\nToile was a great medium for storytelling, and the fabrics depicted a wide array of themes and tales, ranging from representations of texts like La Fontaine's fables to depictions of Chinese life, as imagined by the French (chinoiserie was another eighteenth-century fad). Pastoral themes were among the most common, fitting in with the claims of Enlightenment thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau who idealized country life and argued that it was purer and more wholesome. This fascination even spread to the court, and Marie-Antoinette was known to be taken both with rural life and with the Jouy textiles that depicted it.\n\nWhile the process of making toiles is less laborious today (and thankfully skips the step of soaking them in a mixture of cow dung and water to remove excess color), they remain popular, versatile fabrics. Simultaneously elegant and casual, they fit well with a variety of decor styles, from traditional French countryside to eclectic, funky, and modern (as in Image 6). A number of artists have even made use of toile's storytelling capabilities to make cultural critiques or to subtly incorporate new, modern, or fantastic imagined scenes (Image 7).\n\nFor more in-depth information about toile, check out:\nToile: Explained and Explored\nClassic Wallpaper Pattern: Toiles de Jouy\nToile de Jouy in 3D!
