        "text":"Script reloads window when Netscape Navigator is resized\n\nOverview of the history of Nielloware around the world\n\n\nMost civilizations have devised ways to beautify their metal objects. Some of the methods used for ornamenting metals are hammering, chiseling, engraving, inlay, Niello, enamelling, etc. It has been argued that decorating metal objects with other metals of contrasting colors is simple by creating alloys that melt easily. For instance, dark color alloys can be produced without much difficulty through melting specific metals [4] . Therefore, the early history of an art such as Niello is difficult to establish.\n\nThe origin of Niello has been to Egypt during the 18th dynasty (c. 1540 BC - c. 1292 BC), or in Crete or Mycenae around the same time [5] . According to Avieropolous Choo, one of the earliest examples of Nielloware is a silver cup with Niello decorations originating in Enkomi, Cyprus around 1400 BC (1984). However, other authors, such as Higgins and Frankfort suggest that the first examples of Niello come from Syria. These authors, however, propose different dates of origin, either 1800BC or between the 14th and 12th c. BC.[6]\n\nMost sources agree that Niello was rather popular in Roman times, with production not only in Rome, but also in Roman colonies and in Byzantium. An early example of Niello is a statuette of Roman Emperor Nero from the first century C.E. Other Roman objects decorated with Niello abound through the first five centuries of the Christian era [7]. Link, author who specializes in the history of silver, indicates that the highest achievement in Roman Niello happened during the 4th and 5th centuries C.E. [8]\n\nNiello objects found in Europe originating between the 5th and the 10th centuries seem to have been produced in the British Isles, Byzantium, Constantinople, as far as Sweden and perhaps Syria. Among those objects there are silver dishes, brooches, buckles, bowls, rings, early crosses and reliquaries. Niello is said to have been rare in Sasanian silver objects, although there are a few pieces with small parts of this type of decoration during the 6th century C.E.[9]\n\nAlthough Niello doesn't seem to have been a popular decorating method in China, there are a few examples of Chinese objects with Niello on red brass, white silver and white copper. The earliest Niello object from China is an alms bowl from the 8th century A.D - Tang Dynasty (618-907) [10]. According to McElney, Niello and red brass may have arrived to Canton, China before the 9th century through Arab or Western Asian influences [11]. (1998, p.137) In addition, Gyllensv\u00e4rd attributes a great development in technique, form and ornamentation of Chinese metalwork in the same period to commercial contact with other cultures as Sassanian, Byzantine, Scythian and Indian.[12]\n\nNiello, or a substance similar to it, appears in three European documents before the 10th century C.E. Those include a reference by Pliny in addition to two technical treatises, namely the Leyden Papyrus X from the 3rd century C.E., and the Mappae Clavicula from around the 8th century C.E. While it is unclear if the substance known as a 'black asem' in the Leyden Papyrus was really Niello, the Mappae Clavicula contains several recipes for the preparation of Niello. The recipes differ depending on the composition of the Niello, on the material of the vessel that the Niello is applied to, and on the mode of application.[13]\n\nThere are numerous examples of Nielloware from the 10th century C.E. found in Central Europe, and the British Isles. At the time, jewelry, reliquaries, and metal boxes were still quite popular recipients of this type of ornamentation. Some of those pieces indicate the influence of Oriental craftsmanship [14]. In Persia, during the Seljuk period (1037 C.E.-1194 C.E.) Niello was used to decorate metalwork. [15] In addition, there is evidence of Niello production in other parts of the Middle East provided by a treatise from Yemen, c. 942 C.E., which discusses Niello manufacture. [16]\n\nAlthough it has been proposed that Niello may have originated in Russia, Rosenberg indicates that Niello probably arrived in Russia from Armenia or the Caucasus before 1000 C.E.[17] Tait maintains that Niello production became popular with Islamic craftsmen around the 11th and 12th centuries. Concurrently, there was significant production of elaborate Niello decoration work in Kiev and other cities in Russia .[18]\n\nIn Tabriz, around the year 1300 C.E. Abu'l-Qasim Kashani wrote a treatise where he describes the production of mixed sulphide Niello. [19] In the 13th and 14th, Niello was very popular in France with many different types of objects receiving this type of decoration. Some authors suggest that Niello production started to decline in Europe around the 13th Century as enamel became more fashionable. [20] Nevertheless, in the 15th century there are two sources that mention Niello, one is the \"Trattato dell' Oreficeria,\" by Benvenuto Cellini; the other is a manuscript written by Johannes Alcherius, both contain recipes for Niello. Besides the traditional role in ornamentation Niello became the main element in the decoration of paxes. From that period there are several large engraved Niello silver plaques. At that time Italy had various centers of Niello production, with Florence and Bologna being the most famous. The most renowned artists of that era are Tomaso or Masso Finiguerra, Antonio del Pollaiuolo in Florence; and in Bologna, Francesco Francia and Peregrino da Cesena. Vasari praised Francia as an unsurpassed master in the art of Niello.[21]\n\nAround the beginning of the 17th Century the popularity of Niello started to decline. Consequently, Niello production in Europe diminished considerably. Nonetheless, Niello manufacture was still strong in Russia in the 19th century. This technique was still used until the early 20th century in traditional Islamic jewelry [22] and also in Turkey, Burma, Italy, Russia and Thailand for the production of small objects in general.

        "text":"En plein air\n\nEn plein air (pronounced\u00a0[\u0251\u0303 pl\u025b.n\u203f\u025b\u0281]; French for \"outdoors\"), or plein air painting, is the act of painting outdoors.\n\nEn plein air painter on the C\u00f4te d'Argent in Hourtin, France\n\nThis method contrasts with studio painting or academic rules that might create a predetermined look. The theory of 'En plein air' painting is credited to Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes (1750\u20131819) first expounded in a treatise entitled Reflections and Advice to a Student on Painting, Particularly on Landscape (1800)[1] where he developed the concept of landscape portraiture by which the artist paints directly onto canvas in situ within the landscape.\n\nIt enabled the artist to better capture the changing details of weather and light. The invention of portable canvases and easels allowed the practice to develop particularly in France and in the early 1830s the Barbizon school of painting in natural light was highly influential.[2]\n\nAmongst the most prominent features of this school were its tonal qualities, colour, loose brushwork, and softness of form. These were variants that were particularly relevant to the mid 19th-century Hudson River School and to Impressionism[3]\n\n\nClaude Monet Painting by the Edge of a Wood (1885) by John Singer Sargent. Oil on canvas. 54.0 \u00d7 64.8\u00a0cm. Tate Gallery, London.\n\nBefore the 19th century, artists had mixed their own paints from raw pigments that they often ground themselves from a variety of media. This had made for inconvenient portability and kept most painting activities confined to the studio.\n\nThis changed in the 1800s, when tubes of oil paint became available allowing En plein air painting to become viable for many artists. In the 1830s, the Barbizon school in France that included Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny and Th\u00e9odore Rousseau used the practise to accurately depict the changing appearance of light as weather conditions altered.[4]\n\nIn the early 1860s, four young painters: Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille, met whilst studying under the academic artist Charles Gleyre. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life and they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air.[5] They discovered that they could paint in sunlight directly from nature and making use of the vivid synthetic pigments that were available they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the Realism of Gustave Courbet and the Barbizon school[6] It was radical practise at its inception but by the later decades of the 19th-century the theory had been absorbed into normal artistic practise.\n\nThere were artists' colonies across France such as the one at \u00c9taples on the C\u00f4te d'Opal that included landscape impressionists Eug\u00e8ne Chigot and Henri Le Sidaner. The later artist specialised in translating nocturne light to canvas using oil and pastel.[7]\n\nThe Macchiaioli were a group of Italian painters active in Tuscany in the second half of the nineteenth century, who, breaking with the antiquated conventions taught by the Italian academies of art, did much of their painting outdoors in order to capture natural light, shade, and colour. This practice relates the Macchiaioli to the French Impressionists who came to prominence a few years later, although the Macchiaioli pursued somewhat different purposes. Their movement began in Florence in the late 1850s.\n\nIn England the Newlyn School was also a major proponent of the technique in the latter 19th century.[8] There were lesser known artist colonies practising , including a loose collective at Amberley in West Sussex centred around the Paris trained Edward Stott who produced atmospheric rural landscapes that were highly popular to some late Victorians.[9]\n\nThe movement expanded to America, starting in California then moving to other American locales notable for their natural light qualities, including the Hudson River Valley in New York.\n\nThe act of outdoor painting from observation has been continually popular well into the 21st century.[10][11]\n\nEquipment and challengesEdit\n\nRobert Antoine Pinchon, 1898, painting Le chemin, oil on canvas, 22 \u00d7 32 cm\n\nIt was during the mid-19th century that the 'box easel', typically known as the 'French box easel' or 'field easel', was invented. It is uncertain who developed it, but these highly portable easels with telescopic legs and built-in paint box and palette made it easier to go into the forest and up the hillsides.[12] Still made today, they remain a popular choice (even for home use) since they fold up to the size of a brief case and thus are easy to store.[13]\n\nThe Pochade Box is a compact box that allows the artist to keep all their supplies and palette within the box and have the work on the inside of the lid. Some designs allow for a larger canvas which can be held by clamps built into the lid. There are designs which can also hold a few wet painting canvases or panels within the lid.[14] These boxes have a rising popularity as while they are mainly used for plein air painting, can also be used in the studio, home, or classroom. Since pochade boxes are mainly used for painting on location, the canvas or work surface may be small, usually not more than 20 inches (50\u00a0cm).[15]\n\nChallenges include the type of paint used to paint outdoors, animals, bugs, onlookers, and environmental conditions such as weather. Acrylic paint may harden and dry quickly in warm, sunny weather and it cannot be reused. On the opposite side of the spectrum is the challenge of painting in moist or damp conditions with precipitation. The advent of plein air painting predated the invention of acrylics. The traditional and well-established method of painting en plein air incorporates the use of oil paint.\n\n\nAustralian impressionist Arthur Streeton painting en plein air, c. 1892\n\nFrench impressionist painters such as Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir advocated plein air painting, and much of their work was done outdoors in the diffuse light of a large white umbrella. Claude Monet was an avid en plein air artist who deduced that to seize the closeness and likeness of an outside setting at a specific moment one had to be outside to do so rather than just paint an outside setting in their studio.[16] In the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century in Russia, painters such as Vasily Polenov, Isaac Levitan, Valentin Serov, Konstantin Korovin and I. E. Grabar were known for painting en plein air.\n\nBut enthusiasts of plein air painting were not limited to the Old World. American impressionists too, such as those of the Old Lyme school, were avid painters en plein air. American impressionist painters noted for this style during this era included Guy Rose, Robert William Wood, Mary DeNeale Morgan, John Gamble, and Arthur Hill Gilbert. In Canada, the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson are examples of en plein air advocates.\n\nNotable artists (selected)Edit\n\n\nSee alsoEdit\n\n\n  1. ^ Joshua Taylor (1989), Nineteenth Century Theories of Art, pages 246-7, University of California Press, USA.

        "text":"Do I have to use film for wildlife photos?\n\nUsing Film for Wildlife Photos\nElephants never forget, and thanks to these photos, you won't either.\nElephants never forget, and thanks to these photos, you won't either.\nDavid De Lossy\/Digital Vision\/Getty Images\n\nFilm has long been the medium of choice for wildlife photographers. But just because it's the way things have always been done, does that still mean it's the right way?\n\nWhen you buy any camera, you'll want to think about what kinds of lenses you want. Sophisticated zoom features and interchangeable lenses are two factors that can differentiate digital pictures and those taken on film. With a good digital camera, though, the only person who may be able to detect such a difference in quality would be a professional. At minimum, a photographer using a camera with film may need a 35 mm camera with a normal zoom lens (28 - 105 mm) and a telephoto lens (70 - 300 mm) [sources: Alaska Outdoor Journal; Fairlie; Hill].\n\nPhotographers should also stock up on films of various speeds to ensure a great picture no matter the shooting conditions. Film speed measures a film's sensitivity to light. \"Fast\" film speeds, for example, are highly sensitive and don't require much exposure to produce an image. A \"slow\" film speed, on the other hand, would need a longer exposure time to produce the same image. Low-speed films, such as 100 or 200 speed, are best used in bright light and when the subject is stationary, such as a crocodile sunning itself on a rock. When you're shooting more active animals, or when you're shooting at night, you can then reach for a high-speed film like 400 or 800. These films are better for action shots, because the shutter closes more quickly after you take the picture, framing the subject at the exact moment you want to capture; digital users can alter shutter speed with the push of a few buttons.\n\nIf you're using high-quality film, then each picture can get fairly expensive. You can't shoot and shoot the way you can with a digital camera, unless you're willing to make a hefty investment in film and developing. Of course, it's possible that such a constraint may end up creating better pictures, as you'll take your time with each one, making sure it's perfect before you click.\n\nOne huge disadvantage of film is that you won't know if all your fancy equipment did its work until you get home and develop the film. That's one reason why people are turning to digital.\n\nMore to Explore",

        "text":"Share stunning photos of tattoo designs and body art.\n\nAn In-depth Look at the Nautical Star Color Meaning and Symbolism\n\nNautical Star Color Meaning\nVery few of us are aware of what nautical star tattoos actually mean, and what their colors denote. Each color of the nautical stars have different meanings associated with them.\nBhakti Satalkar\nLast Updated: Mar 19, 2018\nAt a very generic level the meaning of a nautical star tattoo is to guide its wearer towards their desire. All the other meanings are mere versions of this understanding.\nThe nautical star is a symbolic star closely associated with the men serving at the sea. Its simplicity of design, and the profound meaning has made its design a coveted one amongst tattoo enthusiasts.\nThe five-pointed star is often made in dark and light shades, which are interchanged in a manner reminiscent of a compass rose. It is the color of the nautical star which makes the difference in the design. These stars are also made on different sides of the ship also have different meanings attached to them.\nThe nautical stars were made famous by sailors, who wore two stars instead of just one. The left star represented the port side, while the star made on the right side was an indicator of the starboard side. These tattoos were used by sailors to flaunt their love for their life at the sea, a star that guided them though their adventures to safety at all times.
