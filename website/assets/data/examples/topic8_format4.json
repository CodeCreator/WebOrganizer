As a little incentive, 3 of the people who complete the survey will be chosen at random to receive $50! Pretty great huh?\n\nSpeaking of great things, we have a new member generated pattern this week. The design for this playful skirt came from our very own kasia26! Great for summer fun, this skirt features gathering of the pocket backing and bold bib-front buttons.

        "text":"Workout Tops: Let's Talk About Them\n\nOh, hey, guys! Your old friend Allison here. In the last few months, I have gotten serious about working out and eating clean, but you know what kind of the grossest thing is when you realize you have let yourself go a little and decide to get serious about your body again? Trying to find workout clothes that make you feel slender and willowy. Now, black Wunder Under Crops from Lululemon are a given. I struggle most with finding a workout top that is form-fitting while acting as workout Spanx. You know the kind I mean. I have one raspberry pink Scoop Neck tank from Lululemon which I have had for years, and fits the bill perfectly. Alas, they aren't currently selling any on their website and I've heard that they changed the material to one which I fear will do less to \"mask\" lumps and more \"enhance\" them.\u00a0\n\nNow, here's the thing about my body (it's a wonderland? duh.) - I have what Julia calls a \"feminine\" shape - an hourglass, if you will. Sidenote, Sunday night while we were watching Girls, Ben told me that I have \"a Marnie body.\" It was so nice and so untrue and I am so obsessed with Marnie that it really touched my heart. Anyway. I've found that if I try to wear a baggy top, I literally look like a giant trapezoid. Some days, my small-ish ribcage is my only saving grace. I also tend to gravitate towards tops that are simple and solid colored (obviously). Keeping that in mind, check out some of the options that I think might keep me motivated to keep hitting barre classes - and let me know if you know of any I haven't listed here that would be up my alley!\n\nLululemon Power Y Tank\nBeyond Yoga Long Racerback Cami\nLululemon Free to Be Tank\nThomas Kelly Malaga Mix Tank\n\nCurrently listening to: I'm Going Down - Vampire Weekend (Springsteen cover at the end of Girls on Sunday)\n\n\n  1. Hey Allison,\n\n    Great post! I too have been taking this kind of stuff more seriously lately after some pictures of me from Christmas vacation surfaced that I was unhappy with. (what?! that's not me!) Anyways, I was wondering if you had any good blogs or books to recommend on the subject of clean eating?\n\n\n\n  2. I love the Clueless pic! And great recommendations on tops!! I'll definitely have to try these out!\n\n    Haute Child in the City\n\n  3. Check out these from LivFit - they are sooo cute!\n\n  4. ahh clueless pic is hilarious! cute workout gear is a great way for motivation. I JUST downloaded the vampire diaries cover of springsteen too!\n\n  5. I need to hit up Lulu Lemon. Also...that Clueless pic is amazing. So I workout at home {love my Insanity DVD's} and only wear a sports bra. There are a few reasons I do this. 1. I get way too hot and too sweaty to wear a full top and 2. Wearing only a sports bra and seeing it in the mirror motivates me to work out harder. It's kind of mean, but true! xoxo\n\n  6. I keep hearing all the buzz about Lulu Lemon but I still haven't ordered anything...maybe I need to jump on the bandwagon!! And that clueless pic made my day!!! XoXo\n\n  7. Allison\n    I have nominated you for the liebster blog award!! Come see my post to know what to do!\n\n  8. Love these options! I just started to get back on track with some sort of exercise routine and love the last pic super cute.\n    Thanks for sharing.\n\n  9. I love Clueless!! Such a cool post.\n\n    Do you want to follow each other? Let me know.\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\nThanks so much for commenting!\n\nPopular Posts",

Thanks for commenting in!\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nLove the ladies in the scarves.. Very cute! I noticed when I walked by my local Athleta today, their windows were sporting a new color and it is very similar to bordeaux. Shameless copycats!\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nHey, LLA. I'm new to OC and was wondering where it is they are running in the OC store photo? Do you know? Thanks :)\n\nLuluAddict said...\n\n@ anon 6:11 pm - I'd say it's the Newport Back Bay loop.\n\nI usually park off Eastbluff, off Jamboree and head in that way. However, there is an interpretive center on the other side that has real bathrooms (as opposed to portapotties) nearby. It's very pretty but you do have to compete with cyclists for the trails.\n\nI love to run along the paths at the beach. I usually do long runs at Huntington Beach. I park at Edison Community Park in Huntington Beach and head down Magnolia until I hit the beach, about .75 miles, and then head north up and past the pier, which is about about mile 3 from the park. There are water fountains and bathrooms every 0.1 mile or so until you hit the pier and then they are further apart.\n\nLuli Designs said...\n\nI am also wondering if the menthol what the sport tee has been see only over seas? I would live to get this one!\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nLLA - anon 6:11 pm here. Thank you so much for the info! The area seems to have so many great spots for running but I was never sure where to go!\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nDo you think we will see the heathered desert teal in a crew, scoop or long sleeve swiftly?\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n@anon 2:45\n\nOMG! Someone else is using a burgundy color for fall clothing?! STOP THE PRESSES! COPYCATS!!!!!!!\n*eye roll*\n\nI know it's trendy on this blog to trash Athleta but there's a lot to be said for their online shopping experience working correctly all the time every time, not needing to do bend tests in 17 different kinds of angles\/lighting to ensure the clothes aren't see-through, and a sane return policy. I shop at both places, but the snobbery of Lulu's clientele alone is enough to push me more into the Athleta camp.\n\nP.S. Wasn't Lulu getting called out repeatedly recently for their stirrup pants shamelessly ripping off Alo?\n\nKarin said...\n\nLove the Bon Bon Warrior Scarf, so pretty, but too pricey for me. Also, those pastel easter egg wunder unders??? No thanks! I think even my 10 year old niece would think she's too old to wear stuff like that.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n5;18 Athleta is known to rip off lulu.\n\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nActually I tried a bunch of bottoms at athleta and most of them were sheer and ill fitting. I wear a lulu two and tried athletes xxs, xs, and even s and they were all sheer. So you can be all defensive because you probably work for them but athleta is crappy and poor fitting.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nYes, companies copy each other. Everybody does it. As I mentioned in my last post, Lulu was called out for ripping off Alo.\n\n@ anon 3:45pm\nFigured you'd accuse me of working for Athleta. How predictable. I'm an employee of \"the enemy\" if I don't drink the kool-aid? LOL. I don't have words for how dumb it is to accuse a company of copying because they used the color BURGUNDY. In the FALL.\nGo ahead and provide me some proof of Athleta's alleged sheerness, if you would. LLA has already helpfully provided evidence of LLL's several times over on this blog. I own a number of pairs of pants from Athleta and have never had an issue, whereas I stopped buying pants from LLL altogether because the constant returns were just not worth the hassle.\n\nJulie Blanks said...\n\nI have them... I'm 34.",

        "text":"Are aviator eyeglasses going to come back into style?\n\nWhen I think of the 70s (from what I know of it from period movies and shows like Starsky and Hutch,) I always just get this one scene in my mind that sums up everything: a room with fake wood paneling, dark green or orange carpeting, and a bunch of guys sitting around smoking cigarettes, with huge mustaches, wearing tweed suits, and huge aviator-style eyeglasses.\n\nObviously, aviator sunglasses are still retro-cool.\n\nBut I never see ANYONE wearing aviator eyeglasses.\n\nLike these.\n\nThose are some shitty looking ones but I\u2019ve seen frames in that style that look good.\n\nAre these gonna make a comeback?\n\nOg forbid.\n\nI\u2019ve sold a few vintage Ray Ban aviator sunglasses in good shape to collectors on ebay for respectable amounts. Re coming back I don\u2019t think they are quite here yet. They don\u2019t fit everyone\u2019s face shape, and don\u2019t look all that great on women unless you\u2019re going for a dykey policewomen type look. If you\u2019re looking for a circa 1970\u2019s Solider of Fortune look go for it.\n\nThey\u2019re not in fashion? Oh oh.\n\nOr these, to avoid the Dahmer image. :wink:\n\nI think it depends on what you mean by \u2018in style\u2019.\n\nI\u2019ve been around aviation all of my life, and I\u2019ve been wearing Aviators since the '70s. When I got glasses so I could fly, I had my Aviator lenses removed and replaced with prescription lenses. Here\u2019s me wearing them in the late-'90s. I have several pair of Aviator shades that I wear when I.m not flying. (I\u2019ve really got to get flying again!) They fit well under the motorcycle helmet, and they fit my face. And I like to wear HGU-4\/Ps, which are also \u2018aviator\u2019 sunglasses.\n\nI have a pair of Ray Ban Wayfarers. That style seems to have been popular in the '60s, and they made a come-back in the '80s. I wear them knowing full well they\u2019re not in style, but they go well with my straw pork pie hat and I\u2019m a bit of an iconoclast anyway. If fashions go in cycles and it took 20 years for Wayfarers to come back, maybe Aviators are due for a comeback?\n\nAnyway, I wear my prescription Aviators for driving at night, I keep my Wayfarers in the sunglass compartment in my car, a pair of HGU-4\/Ps are usually nearby in case I need some sunglasses and I\u2019m not wearing any, I have cheap sunglasses for kayaking (since they\u2019ll be sprayed with salt water), and I opten wear Oakley OOs under my helmet (they fit under it better than the Aviators).\n\nI think you can make them work if you\u2019re actually an aviator (my grandad has been known to wear 'em), or you write techno-thrillers. (And, come to think of it, my grandfather did tell me a story about how the Soviets tried to kill him, once\u2026)\n\nFake wood paneling will come back first. Then smoking. Then, and only then, tweed suits. Will any man ever again wear a matching jacket and trousers that can\u2019t be worn to the office? I can imagine a backlash resurgence in smoking but I can\u2019t imagine that.\n\nI agree with many here. The sunglasses, which I sport daily, are cool without question. The eyeglasses, however, will never amount to anything again. Mark my words!\n\nI\u2019m here to report I saw a Foster Grant commercial the other day. This may not bode well for optical fashion.\n\nI hope so, at least compared with the faux hipster \u201cI am so square I am hip\u201d fugly rectangular glasses.\n\nThe tear drop lens may make a come back but not the size that I remember wearing in the eighties, i can see terminator wrap arounds coming back before those.\n\n\nWhen did they ever go out of \u201cstyle?\u201d I bought mine in 1982 and wear them every day.\n\nI\u2019ve been wearing Ray-Ban aviators since the 80\u2019s myself. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m an aviator, but really it\u2019s because they have awesome optics and the small framed ones are nice and light and very durable. I have a pair of the large metal frames and a pair of the small metal frames, and both of them are over 20 years old and both still look new. I also like them because of the reasons posted in the wikipedia article - they block a lot of stray light, and the slightly bulged lenses cut down on reflections and glare.\n\nI don\u2019t really like the large frame version. They\u2019re too large, too heavy, and they give you too much of that \u2018Southern Sheriff\u2019 look, if you know what I mean. At least they\u2019re not mirrored. But the small frames are just abou the perfect sunglasses for me.\n\nI have a pair of my late mother\u2019s late husband\u2019s large frame Aviators. Way too big for me.

Despite hearing it from the moment she was born, despite it being\u00a0truth, she will pinch her waist, cringe at her complexion, wish herself anything but.\n\n\u00a0\u2013 Jessica Buttram\n\n\nYou Make Me Beautiful\n\n3 Comments Post a comment\n  1. It is so tough being a woman in this country. We are bombarded with unrealistic images of beauty from the media, made to feel like we\u2019ll never measure up, and then have to fight off all the easy, fattening food options we\u2019ve put up around ourselves. Men have the same issues, but it is still much easier to be a \u201csuccessful\u201d man without having to worry as much about your appearance. And, yes, it all starts at such a young age.\n\n    July 21, 2013\n    \u2022 I always think of that video where they show the model from walking in to the photo shoot all the way through to the magazine cover. It\u2019s like a completely different person. The make-up and styling is only the smallest part of it. The photo-shopping is the crazy part. They make her neck longer, her face thinner, her eyes bigger and further apart, her forehead, ears, lips, nose, hair \u2013 every single thing about her face is changed in some way. So, these images that are making us feel bad about ourselves and the little things we would like to change about ourselves \u2013 it\u2019s all based on something completely fake.\n\n      July 28, 2013\n      \u2022 Exactly, but we still buy into it! It gets easier the older I get, but we all want to be pretty, even us old gals!\n\n        July 29, 2013\n\nLeave a Reply to Mind Margins Cancel reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

Scarves aren't strictly a religious item, even if they are used for religious purposes by some groups.\nI will admit, I do get annoyed when things that ARE religious items (crosses, etc) are used as just a fashion accessory, but I don't see this as that situation at all.\n\n\n  \u2022 Member\n  \u2022 Posts: 1034\nRe: Scarves on head - non-religious\n\u00ab Reply #18 on: March 11, 2013, 02:50:41 PM \u00bb\nI'm not religious, but I love wearing a scarf in the summer like this:\u00a0 http:\/\/www.zigoti.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/06\/how-to-wear-a-bandana.jpg\u00a0 Although I favor more tie-dye\/floral\/patterned prints, not actual bandanas.\n\nSo I say go for it!\u00a0 If you are wearing a scarf with a t-shirt and shorts, people would probably not assume you are wearing it for religious reasons.\u00a0 In other words, I would only think it was religious based on the whole outfit (long sleeves, long pants or skirt, etc.)\u00a0 But even if you did want to wear it with a long shirt and long pants for fashion reasons, that is your right too.\n\nIf I saw a woman with a scarf over here hair, if it looked nice probably all I'd think was \"oh, isn't that pretty!\"If it looked a bit odd (didn't match, or something) I might think \"oh its probably religious\"\u00a0\n\nMaybe this came across wrong, but I actually would think the opposite.\u00a0 Women who wear scarves for religious reasons tend to have pretty scarves that are perfectly coordinated to their outfits, because they wear them every day and are in the habit of choosing a scarf that goes with the rest of the clothes.\u00a0 \u00a0 If I saw a woman in a scarf that was odd or didn't match, I'd probably assume the person was new to wearing them or didn't habitually wear them.\n\n\n  \u2022 Member\n  \u2022 Posts: 11878\nRe: Scarves on head - non-religious\n\u00ab Reply #19 on: March 11, 2013, 02:55:47 PM \u00bb\nI love scarves to be worn on the head, usually as headbands but alas, they like to try to slide out of my hair. :P So if it works for your hair, go for it! :)\nBeyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.

There are tons (TONS!!!) of awesome pins about the different ways you can wear scarves. In my experience, it's unlikely that a scarf worn for fashion would be mistaken for one worn for religious purposes. If you're sporting a scarf as a headband, weaving it into your braid, using it as a bow, etc, it should be clear to most people that it's just a fabulous fashion accessory.\nYou have just begun reading the sentence you have just finished reading.\n\n\n  \u2022 Member\n  \u2022 Posts: 1029\nRe: Scarves on head - non-religious\n\u00ab Reply #24 on: March 11, 2013, 05:12:30 PM \u00bb\nI currently have three scarves tied to my purse strap, and I'm wearing a lovely purple paisley \"do-rag\" style.\u00a0 Folded into a triangle, center on my forehead, ends tied at the back of my head.\u00a0\n\nI change out the ones on my purse to match my clothing.\n\nScarves are pretty.\u00a0 Wear them whenever you want.\nEnglish doesn't borrow from other languages, it follows them down dark alleys and beats them up and searches their pockets for loose grammar.\n\n\n  \u2022 Member\n  \u2022 Posts: 4457\nRe: Scarves on head - non-religious\n\u00ab Reply #25 on: March 11, 2013, 05:31:22 PM \u00bb\nI have decided that no one can leave the house and go anywhere without offending someone for some reason.\u00a0 If people get offended by a scarf, it's their problem, not yours.\u00a0 Wear those scarves!\n\nI am one of those women who cannot wear a scarf\u00a0 on my head, around my neck, around my waist, anywhere.\u00a0 They always end up looking sloppy or falling off.\u00a0 \u00a0I have a lot of pretty scarves that people have given me.\u00a0 What I do is tie them on my handbag strap or handle.\u00a0 They stay put that way and I think it's a nice look.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n  \u2022 Member\n  \u2022 Posts: 402\nRe: Scarves on head - non-religious\n\u00ab Reply #26 on: March 11, 2013, 05:39:36 PM \u00bb\nHaving lived in a strong Muslim area, head scarves that denote religion are obvious. They aren't worn as a fashion statement. Sure, some look nice and have fashionable patterns, but again there are specific ways they are to be worn depending on which form of Islam one follows as well as family\/clan\/sect\/tribal connections. I think of some of my black friends who where scarves wrapped and tied on their heads. It's again obvious that it's cultural, not religious. I also know many college students (I work in a University setting) who wear scarves as a form of a statement rather than fashion. Again, it's obvious. Wear it however you like - whether religious, cultural, a statement, or because it pleases you. What others think doesn't matter unless it specifically goes against your work dress code.\n\n\n  \u2022 Member\n  \u2022 Posts: 21\nRe: Scarves on head - non-religious\n\u00ab Reply #27 on: March 11, 2013, 08:12:47 PM \u00bb\nI think scarves worn over the hair can look gorgeous, and if you've been doing it for a while, you're probably a pro!\u00a0 When I went back to school, one of our class assignments was a demonstrative speech.\u00a0 A lovely girl in my class demonstrated different ways to wear\/tie\/fashion scarves using a hairdresser's dummy.\u00a0 All of the women in the class, ranging in age from 20-something to 50-something, were clustered so closely around the speaker she could barely move!\u00a0 It was a huge hit.\u00a0 Our speaker wore scarves daily, but it was not until that day that I learned that she had lost her hair due to agressive chemo.\u00a0 She always looked so pretty, I just thought she was making a fashion statement.\u00a0 Her health has returned now, as has her hair, but I know from her facebook photos that she's still sporting the scarves from time to time.\u00a0 I say if it works for you, do it!\u00a0 \u00a0:D\n\n\n  \u2022 Member\n  \u2022 Posts: 12435\n  \u2022 xi\nRe: Scarves on head - non-religious\n\u00ab Reply #28 on: March 11, 2013, 10:32:26 PM \u00bb\nI've never been into scarves but I did get some funny looks once.\u00a0 I was in a regional poker tournament (You had to win your way in so you had to be fairly decent)\u00a0 It was in a really old cavernous building built pre-A\/C's in a hot area .\u00a0 Overnight the temperature had plummeted to near freezing.\u00a0 So, this building was cold.\u00a0 I wore my pashima scarf wrapped around my head and my ears, and huddled a bit.\u00a0 I noticed people looking at me funny, and wanting to ask if the scarf was religious or for warmth.\u00a0 But they never could figure out how to do it.

But only applying oils wont help if we also eat healthy food that will help us alot more! Like foods rich in Omega 3 fatty acids, ex: Flaxseed. Foods also rich in Vitamin B6 and B7 are good for hair and vitamin E and C for strong hair!\nIf this all sounds futuristic, it is. But there are good reasons this kind of technology will move forward. Today, Americans spend $800 million on hair restoration surgery. And they\u2019d spend a lot more if the surgery got faster and better.\nHi Allys. The inversion method is free and easy to do! Sit down with your head between your legs, and massage your scalp for 10 minutes a day. By the end of the week, you should already have noticed a dramatic increase in length. I hope this helps \ud83d\ude42\nHair is made up of keratin and dead skin cells. While there\u2019s no direct method to make your hair grow faster overnight, there are steps you can take to keep your hair healthy and long. Talk to your doctor before trying supplements such as biotin, keratin, or other nutritional supplements. They may interact with medications and cause unintended side effects.\nThis look is best described as a warm balayage. It\u2019s definitely one of my favorite styles of balayage because I feel the warmer tones, especially the deep color spectrum of brunettes, give you much more dimension.\nHi Meher, hair straightening treatment may help give the illusion that your hair is growing faster as it\u2019s growing down straight rather than in a spiral but it won\u2019t affect your actual hair growth rate. I would suggest giving the inversion method a try and seeing if it works for you.\nApply to dry hair and work into scalp. Push it all up on your head and wait for 30 min. Then wash with a mild shampoo. You may have to wash twice. Then condition as usual. Towel dry. You will feel the difference, It shines, and feels thicker even the second day,. People comment. This is simple and healty, you won\u2019t regret it.\nI have recently had my hair bleached for the first time. I was not planning to do it, but it turned out that my hairdresser didn\u2019t understand me. Half of my hair was bleached ( at the bottom), and some parts of my hair was bleached at the roots. Yesterday I noticed that the bleached parts were starting to break off, and I am very worried that eventually all of the hair that was bleached at the top will break off before new hair grows. If that would happen it would be terrible, since my hair is already thin and will look completely see-through. Will all the bleached hair break off?\nHi Johanna, thanks for your question. Do you mean your middle parting is growing slowly? Have you found the parting is getting bigger? It sounds like you may have some slow hair growth, give the tips in the article a go. I wouldn\u2019t suggest cutting your hair again unless you prefer it to be shorter.\nThankyou for sharing these helpful tips. I agree with the biotin thing, it works wonders for my hair. I also use curry powder and curd along with the onion juice to make my hair thick, long and bouncy. \ud83d\ude42 Do check out my hair story as well.\nThe look I created here is effortless. My client is low maintenance, but in no means sloppy. We took her faded out summer golden blonde and used Wella color to add dimension and shine and cut it into a medium bob with lots of texture.\nSo can you almost garuntee that the methods will make my hair grow. Fast. I would like my hair to grow longer and i haven\u2019t really found anything. But the oil massage seems interesting. And about how long do you think my hair would grow using your methods, and about how long will it take?\nHi Emma. Unfortunately, these are baby hairs. I too have bad ones at the front and despite everything I\u2019ve tried, they won\u2019t seem to grow or go! My best suggestion is using hairspray\/other products to keep them neatly in place. I\u2019ve found using a volumizing mousse before blow-drying off my forehead seems to work best.\nI had hairs just below the hip length\u2026 Bt got layer haircut now it is upto midback or waist is due fault of hairdresser How long it will take to get my original size of hair.. i.e. upto hip length? I need my original length as soon as possible .. I want the result within 2 months Please suggest me some ideas\u2026 I dont lyk this length of hair\u2026\nI hello, I am new to theses natural remedies to help with hair growth. I did try thr egg beaten and then used the big tub of cocnt oil but how do I get it to spread easier it just wants to stay in chunks and hard to spread.?\nBad hair days, we all have them and some experts say we experience them up to 3 times a week. If you have less, then you are lucky. But why do we experience then only a couple times a week, not every day? Let\u2019s see what causes bad hair days and how to overcome them. In the meantime, there is a way to get a handle on those days until your tresses are back to their lustrous, shiny beauty.\u00a0New Look Institute\u00a0has a number of ways to help and support you with everything from hair restoration systems, to wigs, extensions and toppers.\u00a0\nHi Ammaarah, The best thing about hair, is that it almost always grows back, so don\u2019t fret! You have said your hair is dry, so first and foremost I would recommend a coconut oil treatment to renourish it and get it looking and feeling healthy again. Secondly, I would advise the inversion method to encourage hair growth. Do these things, and within a few months your hair should look better than ever! I hope this helps \ud83d\ude42\nUntil then, one other great way to treat baldness is to embrace it, and choose the shaved head look. Research suggests this strategy could score you some serious street cred: people tend to assess smooth-headed baldies as both stronger and taller than their hair-brained counterparts.\n\u201cYou never want the section of hair you\u2019re brushing to be wider than the brush,\u201d says Santiago. A little serum\u2014Santiago likes Oribe Smooth Style Serum\u2014will also make the brush go through your hair more smoothly. \u201cApply it to the midsection of the hair, not at the roots.\u201d\nHi Katherine, you don\u2019t have to use coconut oil no. You can use a good hair conditioner or even a touch of olive oil. It makes it easier to massage your scalp, and also provides a good conditioning treatment at the same time.\nListen\u2026make a paste one night before applying. The paste consists of Henna powder, reetha powder, Amla powder and shikakai powder. Now boil methi seeds and tea leaves in water. Now mix all the above powders together with the help of this water and yogurt. Keep it overnight. Right before applying, take one or two eggs according to the length of your hair and beat it properly. Now apply the mask. Keep it for 3-4 hours. Wash it with cold water. Only with cold water. No shampoo, nothing. Now oil your hair properly after your hair dries. Use shampoo the next day. Try once a week. You will see the difference in two months.\nAt some point, the follicle will begin to grow again, softening the anchor point of the shaft initially. The hair base will break free from the root and the hair will be shed. Within two weeks the new hair shaft will begin to emerge once the telogen phase is complete. The process results in normal hair loss known as shedding.\nAt New Look Institute, clients can expect to receive plenty of individual attention, as well as access to proven hair replacement solutions that are sure to meet their needs. We invite anyone who is struggling with thinning hair to visit our hair replacement studio in San Jose, where you\u2019ll learn more about the options that meet your lifestyle, budget, and hair loss needs. Come visit New Look Institute for a one-on-one consultation today.\nHair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen phases. Each phase has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair. All three phases occur simultaneously; one strand of hair may be in the anagen phase, while another is in the telogen phase.\nHi I am samjhana. I hav a big problem with my hair. My hair is so curly like I hav made it in the parlour but its real. My hair is so fizzy. There is too much hairfall and it doesn\u2019t grow. 2 yrs ago I hav shoulder length hair then I cut it to thaicut hair. At the year end it became shoulder length but from then, I hav been waiting for 2 yrs but it doesn\u2019t grow even 1cm.I hav tried many hair products suggested by many parlourists but nothing happened can u suggest me anything that works?\nHaving extremely long hair has been my passion since I was 14. I used to think that it was pretty tough. With this article, wikihow articles, and pinterest, I\u2019m able to get my hair to go below the waistline and almost to my hips. I\u2019m getting closer to classic length without realizing it. 6-8 inches to my goal length, baby (15-20 cm)! I eat more than enough almonds almost every day. More than any other nut I\u2019ve eaten. Nobody in my family has hair as long as mine. The longest my female friends and family can go is down to their armpits. My sister had waist length hair and now it stayed at armpit length since last summer (June 2017). Most people don\u2019t start doing treatments to their hair till later in life. It really was a good thing I started paying attention and doing all of the easy steps. Just now as I was doing the inversion method, I apply a really small amount of Argan oil (1 pump to avoid greasiness) and massage it in. It\u2019s like a natural serum without the harsh chemicals including alcohol.\nI always get oily, unkempt looking hair after I use coconut oil. It helps my hair but it\u2019s awfully hard to style when you have to be out for most of the day and you still want to look acceptable. Any tips?\n\nMassage your hair and scalp with warm olive oil and leave it on for at least 30 to 45 minutes. Rinse it out thoroughly and wash your hair using a mild shampoo. You can also leave the oil on your hair overni... (truncated)",

The jarring multiple prints, high-contrast color combinations, oddly-proportioned trousers\u2026 for me, it\u2019s just too too much in a loud, unpleasant way, not a fun OTT way. (Third look excepted, of course.) Individual pieces might be quite nice on their own in mellower ensembles\u2013the first shirt would look great with a pair of old jeans, as would the mauve print jacket (over a plain t-shirt).

Robert\n\n    June 25, 2012 at 5:24 am\n\n    Something about it I don\u2019t like at all.

AET\n\n    June 25, 2012 at 8:05 am\n\n    As an American who lived and worked in Indonesia for two years, the 4th picture immediately made me think of Indonesian men in Batik shirts. I was interacting mostly with government officials on Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi and the rule of thumb seemed to be: the more important the man is, the bigger the patterns on his batik shirt. The size of an official\u2019s cojones was directly proportional to the size of the flowers and birds and butterflies in the batik. By those standards, the 4th outfit looks quite feminine and demure. I\u2019m all for embracing this look. Why should women have all the fun with prints?\n\n  58. mattiabdk\n\n    June 25, 2012 at 8:15 am\n\n    Cool outfits !!!!!!\n\n\n  59.

Most of their sizes seem to be small, medium, large etc though with small being 8-10 and medium 12-14. So if I am a definate 10-12 what should I buy?!!!\n\nAlso any experince of the quality, cut etc. They seem cheap so I am presuming it is not fantastic?\n\n\nEldonAve Fri 01-May-09 11:04:40\n\nHave you checked your measurements against their size chart?\n\nSoupDragon Fri 01-May-09 11:07:13\n\nI've always found the quality to be pretty good, actually.\n\nNeena28 Fri 01-May-09 11:08:38\n\nYes I kind of have! Haven't got a tape measure and know i have put on a little weight lately. I just never really trust what they put on the size chart to be honest. I know in some shops sizes can vary between styles and was also wondering if they were like that there. Iyswim? Was hoping someone could say oh a medium is like a next size 12 or actually like a next size 14 then i would have more idea.\n\nNeena28 Fri 01-May-09 11:10:04\n\nthanks soupdragon. Do you just buy your standard size as such?\n\nksld Fri 01-May-09 11:17:05\n\nI am a size 10-12 usually - so for example in Next I would try on the size 12 and usually it fits, although sometimes I can get into a size 10. I always get a Medium size top in Uniqlo. They are not large sizes I don't think, but I have plenty of room in the Medium. Trousers are more difficult - I have a pair of size 10 jeans that fit perfectly from Uniqlo and 2 pairs of size 12 that also fit perfectly. Uniqlo quite often have free returns or other offers. If you can't get to a shop I would wait until they have an offer on and order 2 different sizes so you can try them both out....\nQuality wise I think they are fabulous - my DH has a top from there that is 8 years old and still looks really good.\n\nNeena28 Fri 01-May-09 11:27:17\n\nThat is perfect thanks ksld. I am miles from a shop so didn't want to be faffing round sending things that were ridiculously wrong back etc! Great tip too about free returns etc thanks\n\nOrmIrian Fri 01-May-09 11:28:41\n\nGood quality. Possibly slightly smaller sizing.\n\nwillali Fri 01-May-09 11:37:40\n\nI agree re small sizing - I would go up a size esp for jumpers which are cut to fit IYKWIM\n\nJoin the discussion\n\nJoin the discussion\n\nRegistering is free, easy, and means you can join in the discussion, get discounts, win prizes and lots more.\n\nRegister now",
