        "text":"Question for the shorties (petites)! :)\n\nmake-up junkie\n\nHow many of you more petite chickies shop in only petite sections? I'm 5'0 - okay fine - 4'11 and I'm never happy with the way my clothes fit. My old co-worker kept telling me to shop in the petite sections. I'm going to give it a try again but I find a lot of stores don't have petite sections. The only ones I know of are Banana Repulic and I think the Gap but it's only online I believe...Does anyone know of any other stores??\nAug 12, 2009 @ 04:52 pm\n\n8 Replies\n\n\n\nI am a shortie but I don't like shopping in petite sections of stores... Taking advice from What Not to Wear's Clinton & Stacy, I am a big believer in just finding a good tailor. Having said that, I have heard of a few boutique type stores like which I heard carry great pieces but I have yet to check out....\nAug 12, 2009 @ 05:09 pm\n\nThe Bay\n\nSome of the better Bay stores (downtown) have a decent selection of petites. Have you ever try Laura Petites? Winners is also is worth a shot.\nAug 13, 2009 @ 08:57 am\n\nNew York and Co.\n\nI'm a shortie, too (about 5'2\"). I pretty much only buy pants in petite sizes. Gap carries a petite line, but you're right, only online. Old Navy carries a short line. I've also found a lot of luck w\/ New York and Co.'s short line. I'm not sure what it is but New York and Co.'s pants just fit me perfectly -- cut just right for my body shape.\nAug 13, 2009 @ 09:26 am\n\n\ni too love shopping at new york and company..they fit very well,and have some good deals too...just now they ve buy 1 get one free pants going on.\nAug 13, 2009 @ 10:52 am\n\n\nI'm a shorty too,and I always need to alter the length of my pants.I think I'll try your suggestions as well,thanks!\nAug 13, 2009 @ 11:10 pm\n\n\nreitman's has a petite line.\n\ni always try on stuff from the petite lines but i don't always buy from\nthem. i am 5 ft tall and i find even in petite clothing, I still have\nto hem my pants. so if i have to hem my pants anyway, i don't limit\nmyself to certain stores\/selections.\nAug 15, 2009 @ 02:17 pm\n\nnever really thought about this...\n\nhaha i'm the same height as make-up-junkie : ) i usually don't have a problem finding a right fit. but i do have to get like xs-xxs...and they usually run out of smaller sizes. I do however, find that it's harder to find pants\/jeans etc. Even if i find the right one, i need to hem it.. but sometimes hemming it changes the shape and look of it. Maybe i should start shopping at places where they offer petite styles.\n\nOkay.. i also shopped at the kids section before. I've bought a zara kids jackets at half the adult version's price. And it fits so much better. So take a peek at the kids section once in a while and you may be surprised.\nAug 17, 2009 @ 01:09 pm\nmake-up junkie\n\n\nThanks for all the suggestions guys! Yah, I'd like to invest in a good tailor but getting things hemmed is just not convenient. I just want to buy clothes and not worry about hemming. Most shirts I'm usually fine with but certain blouses, pants\/jeans, and skirts are huge and look weird after I alter them.\n\nMandy- haha I will check out the kids section but have a feeling I'll be a bit big and I'm not talking about height! haha I'm small but I've got some meat to me unfortunately! lol\nAug 17, 2009 @ 10:48 pm\n\nLeave A Reply\n\nYour Reply:\n\n\nJoin Our Newsletter\n\nStay in the loop for the latest news, contests, deals and more!",

First it was Miley Cyrus who debuted a very, um, different blond pixie cut, then Kellie Pickler shaved off her hair in solidarity for a BFF who has cancer (which is so nice we can\u2019t take it), and now, it\u2019s Lady Gaga doing the deed, shaving off a part of her hair in honor of her friend slash photographer Terry Richardson, whose mother recently passed away from cancer.\n\nGaga tweeted out this last night:\n\nWith this pic along with it:\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s definitely an edgy look, but we woudln\u2019t expect anything less from Lady G. The good news, though? She can easily cover it up with one of her many wigs (or maybe borrow one from Nicki Minaj) if she gets bored.\n\nAnd of course, we can\u2019t forget Kellie Pickler\u2018s recently-shorn strands, too. She\u2019s taking a stand against cancer in honor of her best friend who\u2019s currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer, and taking to her Twitter to spread the word. So admirable, Kel! Check out the video of it actually happening right here.\n\n\n\nAnd speaking of Twitter, Miley Cyrus has been quite active on it lately, showing off her new short hair via Twit pics. Granted she\u2019s not as bald as Gaga and Kellie, but she is certainly bold:\n\n\n\nAre you on board with the new short hair trend? Which singer rocks the look the best? Vote and make sure to tell us how you really feel in the comments!\n\nVote For Your Favorite Miley Cyrus Hairstyle!\n\nSpread the Word\n\n\nPrevious Post Miley Cyrus Cuts Hair Bun\nHair Today, Gone Tomorrow: The Best of @Mileys_Bun on Twitter!\nNext Post Miley Cyrus Hairstyle Battle\nFind Out Which of Miley Cyrus\u2019 Hairstyles Won the Survival Game!\n  \u2022 khalaryah\n\n    I think miley is winning votes because her hair looks the best she is always on point\n\n  \u2022 Hannah\n\n    I voted Kellie. I dont know exactly why Mileys winning the votes. She just did it to do it. Kel and Gaga did it for cancer. I just think its really cool that Kellie shaved her entire head!\n\n  \u2022 mary udunma kalu\n\n    lady gaga is something else.. Very funny to have her hair cut. Loi i can\u2019t stop laughing..

        "text":"Thursday, June 23, 2011\n\nHair Today, Gone Tomorrow\n\nBy Grace Terhune\n\nSouthern Beauty Shop mysteries (Lila Dare)\n\nI suppose y'all could guess that since I make my living as a stylist, I think about hair a lot. I find myself checking out the hair on the women (and some of the men) I see when I'm out and about in St. Elizabeth. Have you ever noticed that different parts of the country seem to have slightly different trends in hairstyles? Here in the South, women still like their hair a little full and mostly long. We like up-dos for weddings and formal events. And we like our highlights!\n\nLadies from the northeast, if Real Housewives of New Jersey is anything to go by, like big hair, too, but they're more likely to be brunette and to actually tease their hair. Ye gods! Teasing is NOT good for your hair, ladies.\n\nCalifornia gals like that sleek Jennifer Aniston look and midwesterners are more likely to wear their hair short or tied back in a ponytail. Must be because all that wind completely undoes a 'do.\n\nI just let my mom cut me some bangs and do some lowlights in my hair. I like to change my style now and then--more so now that there's an interesting man or two in my life!\n\nHow do you wear your hair? do you change it up when something changes in your life? (Marriage, baby, lost job, whatever?)\n\n\n  1. I'm in the Pacific Northwest and change my hair whenever I get bored. I've had it both long and super short. Right now it is short with a little flip to the ends. It is a copper color with blondish highlights. Actually, those highlights are now pink, teal, and blue. I get those colors every year for Relay for Life. They are the thyroid cancer awareness ribbon colors and since I've had thyroid cancer I wear them proudly to show I am a survivor!\n\n  2. I keep my hair short; makes it easier when I'm on the run and running late.\n\n  3. Hmmm, well I am from the midwest (Indiana) and I wore my hair straight or up in a ponytail most of the time.\n\n    I now live in the south (Louisiana) and I kept it mid length, and would still pull it up in a ponytail once in a while.\n\n    I recently cut my hair short (above the collar). I've been working out and have lost approx. 40 pounds since January, and with the heat wave and all, it was just too hot and heavy.\n\n    I have a lot of grey in my hair, and had kept it light brown, but I am moving on to blonde (dark) this week.\n\n    Have a grand of a day!\n\n  4. I had it long for years, then cut it all off. It was flattering, everyone said, and I liked it, but I couldn't play with it as much. I have every kind of hair thingie imaginable! So now it's growing out again.\n\n  5. I wish I lived near you, Grace!\n\n  6. I'm at the mercy of my hairdresser. She suggests a change & I go for it -- I like to think I'm being adventuresome. Perhaps not.\n\n  7. I have lived most of my life in the South but definitely am not into the Southern style hair. It is short and thick. Have red hair which is going grey so it looks like it is frosted. And have a terrible time finding someone who can cut it good. Wish I was near to you Grace.\n\n  8. Hi ladies,\n\n    You sound like a brave lot--changing up your hair often and going against fashion. Good for you! It's attitudes like that that help keep us stylists in business!\n\n    Tonya--Congrats on the weight loss! Ria--I've been wanting to go reddish so maybe I'll try a copper color like yours this summer, but I don't think I'm enough of a rebel to have the pink and teal tips, although it sounds like yours are for a good cause.\n\n  9. I live in Texas with a Midwest hairdo, since that's where I'm from. Not a ponytail, though, chin length bob. Or a little longer. Interesting observations!",

        "text":"Wednesday, September 12, 2018\n\nDo blondes have more fun?\n\nIn response to my Ask Me Anything post, Pricilla sent me the following e-mail:\nHi Stana,\nI have wondered why you chose to change your hair color from Blonde to Brown?? Don't Blondes have more fun!!!\nYou continue to look great.\nThank you for the question and the kind words!\n\nI changed my hair color because I needed a change. (Isn't it a woman's prerogative to change her hair color?)\n\nWhen I began seriously dressing as a woman, that is, not for a Halloween costume, I usually wore an red wig. Although my natural hair color was brown, I wore red because my parents always claimed that I was born a redhead and remained a redhead during my early years. So when I was choosing a wig color, I figured red might work since I started here as a redhead. Turned out that I liked myself as a redhead and wore various shades of red for years.\n\nI finally went over to the light side in 2006 after hosting a support group meeting at a wig store (Tonkin's in Waterbury). As the hostess, I brought the snacks, played mother hen and had no intention of buying a new wig.\n\nWhen the proprietor, Kathy Tonkin was finished bewigging the other girls, she said to me, \"Your turn.\"\n\nI thought, \"What the heck\" and told Kathy to work her magic on me.\n\nMinutes later, she fitted a short blond wig on my head. When I looked in the mirror, I loved what I saw and I became a blonde.\n\nI have been a blonde for the past 12 years... different shades of blonde, different hair styles, but always blonde. But I was getting a little bored with being a blonde and decided to try something different.\n\nAnd so it goes.\n\nWearing Tibi blazer and skirt, L'Agence Daniella cami, Lente Danse bag (Source:\n\nSource: Pinterest\nBefore and After (Source: Pinterest)\n\n\n  1. As I always say: Blondes can have as much fun as anybody else; blondes, simply, just ARE more fun! :-)\n\n  2. Love your brunette look!\n\n  3. Check out the first of the two 'Pintrest' photos....\n    MOM is growing FINGERS out of her left shoulder!\n\n    1. I assumed those fingers belonged to the older girl wrapping her arm around the woman's back.\n\n    2. I think that's just some detail on the wall or photograph behind her. I'd love to see where these came from; an image search doesn't work because of the combined photos.\n\n    3. Pretty sure those are my daughter's fingers.\n\n  4. This comment has been removed by a blog administrator.\n\n  5. Maybe, but judging from the size of the arm of the first child, in the other paragraph, the scale seems off.. V.\n\n  6. All of your face photos are great. You have that wonderful smile set off by the great job you do on your lips.\n\n  7. The femulator in question is Lt. Colonel Bryan\/Bree Fram, an out and visible member of the USAF.",
