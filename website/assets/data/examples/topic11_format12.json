The people enjoyed the warmth of the day, as the Bomy Moons approached. The world seemed to be in perfect balance.\n\nPreparing for Danger\n\nThe world was unprepared for what was about to happen. Sightings of a large meteor were taking place all over the land. Scholars revealed that it wasn't a meteor, but a moon. For many years, the Suns of the Bomy planet had passed near the land. Sometimes, the Suns would pass right over one another. Causing a Sylvester, that heated the Graalian world with bright red intensity.\n\nHowever, something had went wrong. The Bomy Moon became disaligned from the planet, and was hurdling towards the peaceful world of Graal.\n\nAll the Graalians could do was prepare for the worst. The Moon crashed heavily into the sea, causing massive tidal waves to wash over the land. It appeared that the damage had been done... but it was just beginning...\n\nWorldly Changes\n\nThe impact of the Moon caused devastating underground destruction. Underwater volcanoes became active from the intense earthquake, causing islands to emerge from the sea. Lava became hard as stone quickly after being engulfed in water. Clouds of ash arose from the water and into the sky.\n\nThe tidal waves began to subside, and the half-submerged Moon could be seen in the middle of the land.\n\nUnwelcome Visitors\n\nApproaching the Moon, Graalians witnessed what appeared to be movement on it's surface.\n\nBomies began to emerge from the craters. When the alien bomies looked around the land, they became enraged. They discovered that their own Bomy race, were being treated like Graalian pets. This caused anger in the alien bomies, and they immediately began to attack the Graalians. The people fought valiantly to save their home. After a long battle, it appeared that the alien bomies had been defeated.\n\nTurn for the Worst\n\nKnowing that they were outnumbered and beate... (truncated)",

Recombinant licensed the engine to PF.Magic (for a project called Velocity), and to MGM Interactive (for a project called Cyberthug). Unfortunately both of these projects were canceled before completion. After that Kevin & Will decided to get out of the video game business, so we have this mostly complete engine and nothing to do with it, so we decided to GPL it.\n\nSince then KevinSeghetti has continued to work on it in his spare time and has ported it to Linux (it was orignally written for Sony Playstation and Windows), and is working on open source tools for it (originally it used a proprietary 3D modeller, 3D Studio MAX, as its level editor).\nTopic revision: r1 - 21 Jun 2002, WillNorris;\nThis site is powered by FoswikiCopyright \u00a9 by the contributing authors.

Through the IGDA, game developers can learn and share knowledge, build relationships, and learn new skills, while helping to shape the future of the global game industry. Our goal is for this community to be a valuable resource for anyone passionate about game development, from an indie designer sketching level designs on a napkin to a triple-A team on their third sequel. The IGDA provides several ways for both individuals and organizations to get involved:\n\n\nIGDA chapters connect game developers in their local communities. Professional and Academic Chapters hold guest speaker lectures, social gatherings, planning meetings, game jams, and other events in over 100 cities around the world. Our chapters are one of the easiest ways for IGDA members to meet others to learn, teach, or collaborate close to home. Don't see a chapter in your area? Learn how to start one!\n\n\nSpecial Interest Groups\n\nThe IGDA special interest groups (SIGs) will help you connect with others who are interested in a particular topic or specialists in a specific discipline. SIG members work together to teach and learn from each other, promote their specialties, identify new technical or aesthetic challenges, and advance the art and industry of game design.\n\n\nIGDA Scholars are the most promising students studying game development and related fields. and are selected via a rigorous application process. Scholars benefit from the guidance of industry professionals, and receive free access to industry events, such as the Game Developer's Conference. IGDA Scholarships are an opportunity for talented students to get a head start in the competitive world of professional game development.\n\n\n\nMany of our members, affiliates and partners rely on several popular crowdfunding platforms to build their communities and financially support their work. As a service to the IGDA developer community, we keep a list of projects on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. IGDA members are able to submit their projects for consideration to be included.\n\n\nMVP Awards\n\nSo much of the IGDA's success and progress is due to the support and involvement of countless volunteers from the community.

        "text":"Play Necromium NOW!\nBackground story\nThe World Map\nAbout the website\nCurrent Staff\nFounders\/Retired Staff\nRecent Changes\nPlayer Armory\nNews Archive\nWho's online\nPlayer Data\nQuest Department\nGame help files\nZone maps\nNew player Info\nClass guide\nNecromium Forums\n\nVote for Our Mud on TMC!\n\nUPTIME: 8 d 23 h 21 m\n\nRecent News:\n\nClimate change wha? 06\/22\/15 - Seosaimhin\n\nStay in, stay cool! Starting a new character in a new game can be daunting. We have friendly players, a helpful tutorial and a \"mud school\" to teach you the basics (along with free levels!) ample experience areas, special areas for lower-level players to get the feel of the game without competing with more advanced players, and so much more, making the effort really pay off in Necromium.\n\nVirtually unlimited character personalization (264 character path options, along with an extremely personalizable training system) with an almost overwhelmingly customizable display, combat information, and prompts make you feel at home right away with your info delivered the way you want it.\n\nWith nearly 32 thousand rooms, 5500 unique monsters, and 7500 objects spread across over 50 massive zones on five continents (separated by large oceans, home to seafaring travelers and ocean combat!), the world of Necromium is a giant and immersive one, boasting an extensive and detailed set of overhead maps with multiple display configurations to suit your personal preference. Colorful and functional, our maps are a point of pride worth exploring.\n\nClans and Houses offer a social and organizational aspect to this player friendly environment. Active Immortals and compulsive builders enable new zones to open regularly. We have a historically active player base (the game just turned 19 years old!) that allows new players individual interaction over multiple configurable channels as well as private message and in-game mailing of messages and items. This is not an RP game and we host a variety of diverse personalities across our active base.\n\nPlayer-organized runs for equipment in the highest-level raid zones, as well as other groups set up for mass experience gain are commonplace. Focused group cooperation in these zones (which can take up to 9 people working together to down the hardest of end bosses) allows groups to access the very best in equipment in the game. A coded group dicing system maintains transparency in splitting treasures and equipment. To ensure the small player base can support the larger, more difficult areas, limited multi-play can be an option if it meets the criteria (known as \"droning\").\n\nIn the end, there's an unlimited number of ways to play and experience Necromium, and there's a reason some players have been coming back for so long their characters are old enough to vote!\n\nCome be cool with us at Necromium, where death is a way of life!\n\nWelcome! 10\/02\/13 - Vakana\n\nFun in the sun, hot weather, playing at the beach?! Pfffft. How about slaying monsters, finding rare equipment, stacking gold, and watching your back in chaotic player killing zones?\n\nWelcome to Necromium, where death is a way of life. We are a heavily modified circle mud with 4 base classes, thief, cleric, warrior, and mage. Each class plays an important role when you take on equipment zones that can take from 20 minutes to 2 hours to complete. Hoping that rare drop appears and it maxtweaks.\n\nNot everyone in Necromium walks around with the same exact gear, because gear 'tweaks' in Necromium, it has a chance to go up or down in stats, making that unique piece of equipment have the potential to be the best compared to other 'normal' equipment. This lets you have more variety and control over what you choose to wear, as long as you can get it to tweak right!\n\nOur PK is lacking right now, because we aren't afraid of YOU yet. The game is very pk-able with immortal ran quests available, chaotic player killing where you can steal up to 3 pieces of your victim's equipment, and regular player killing where you just suffer a loss of life. There are plenty of regular non-PK zones where you can safely explore also.\n\nYou can't touch our maps, either.. We also have an enormous selection of varied zones (30,000+ rooms - 130+ original zones) spanning over 5 continents with ocean travel and combat, from many different creative builders that has been brought to life over 16 years. Come check us out, you may get addicted, or you may get stabbed in the face.\n\nWe are a community of new and old players that stays around 8-17 online right now but the game needs more explorers, our PK scene is not very active (people are just casually strolling around in chaotic zones, killll them!) but the general socializing and running equipment happens very often, come stir up some action! We are all friendly and are always eager to help answer all questions and help you get going. There are legit active builders and a coder that is constantly improving the game and listening to your opinions.\n\n\nA roundup of some recent updates 11\/03\/12 - Jaguar\n\nI realized that some people don't log into the game, but do still check the forums, so for those people... if you're curious what's happening with Necromium lately, here are some updates!\n\n* Alliances between Noble Houses are limited to pairs - no more 3- or 4-house \"super-alliances\"\n* House Arturon ( House 8 ) is no longer in the game\n* Andalusian Mines got a revamp\n* The Monastery of Devenon got a revamp\n* Lord Felis' Jungle Kingdom got a revamp\n* New zone: The Ruins of Rl'yeh\n* \"Newbie\" EQ (Varanno, Maudslay, etc.) made !33 - including existing items in the game\n* Varnia, Volcano, and Iridium Castle received some updates\n* Crimdrac's Castle, Xanhador, and Hulion Village received some updates\n* Dungeons of Numkrad updated to have EQ for all classes\n* New zone: Temple of the Black Rose\n* Necromium City now has a CP Shop, to purchase special items\n\n\nChanges 10\/06\/12 - Jaguar\n\nWhile changes can come in fits and spurts here on Necromium, we've tried to keep the flow up in the last couple of years. A feature that not many people are aware of is that the in-game CHANGES list is available here on the web... and it goes much further back than the 19 changes shown in-game. You can find it on the left sidebar under \"Recent Changes\", or just click: Recent Changes.\n\nAlso, while we haven't publicized it much, there is a web-playable version of Necromium - no zMud or other client needed! It can also be found to the left under \"Play Now\", or by clicking Play Now!\n\nFinally, Necromium does have a SMALL social presence, existing on Facebook at facebook.com\/Necromium\n\nHope you stop on by again!\n\n\n'c resurrect Necromium' 04\/09\/11 - Jaguar\n\nHey there party people,\n\nRemember Necromium? That game that so many of you used to play? Well, if you're anything like a good-sized handful of other such players, now may be a good time to come and check it out again!\n\nI'm terrible about updating this front page, but that by no means should be taken to mean that the game has been stagnant! To the contrary, since our last front-page post, hundreds of code changes, tweaks, new features, updates, fixes, and more have gone in on a steady basis. Much has changed in our fair world, and most of it designed to improve the fun and usability and ease of enjoyment of the game. More EQ running, easier leveling, fewer punitive penalties, more tweaks, less \"oldstat can't be beat\", and more!\n\nSo come by and check us out, and if you're a new player, come see what you've been missing!\n\n\n( PS: For a more thorough list of changes, take a peek at http:\/\/www.necromium.com\/forums\/viewtopic.php?t=7468 )\n\n\u00a9 1996-2005 Necromium.

The first of its kind, and with just as unique a goal. To help create solutions for a sustainable planet.\n\nHow? By helping young gamers think in that direction while using their typical digital skills. And then translate that to the outside world. By doing so on a global scale we aim for the new generations to come up with new solutions. Both online and offline.\nRead on \u00bb\n\nWhy we do it\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.\u201d Albert Einstein\n\nChildren solve problems while playing. And without thinking twice. It\u2019s in their nature to keep trying until things work out. We want to tap into that energy, and help them to use that capability. They are the carriers of future ideas and solutions. PlayReal aims to support them by building these, through playing. And create a new way of thinking in doing so.\nRead on \u00bb\n\nNext Phases\n\nWe recently completed the experimental Phase of the project. We are now working on the next two Phases.\n\nRead on \u00bb\n\nWho does it benefit\n\n\u201cTell me and I will forget, show me and I might remember, involve me and I will understand.\u201d\nChinese proverb\n\nPlayReal offers great benefits for children, organisations and schools.\n\nRead on \u00bb\n\nPlayReal for Organisations\n\nWe begin by framing the organisation\u2019s need, which could be to communicate a message, come up with ideas for new products, think of new strategies, etc. Then we develop a story and characters that reflect this need.\n\nWe create adventures that invite players to come up with solutions. From the organisation\u2019s knowledge, values and resources, we create a game character (Intergalactic Counsellor).\n\nRead on \u00bb\n\nPlayReal for Schools\n\nWe begin by framing the educational outcome. Then we weave the educational content into a story. We create adventures that invite players to think creatively, work collaboratively and come up with solutions to real-world problems.\n\nWe seek for organisations that provide knowledge, values and resources in the given theme and create a character for them (Intergalactic Counsellor).\n\nRead on \u00bb\n\nIntergalactic Counsellors\n\nPlayReal drives on participation from organisations providing knowledge on specific areas. That can be farming, engineering, architecture, biology or water management, for example. Together with the players they help create local solutions for the challenges being presented.\n\nRead on \u00bb",

Phase 3 consists of teaching to populous survival and diplomacy training through Halo: Reach and Magic: The Gathering, both of which are mandatory to learn at the company. Phase 4 is leadership, negotiation and etiquette training through required viewings of educational films such as \"Office Space\", \"Tommy Boy\", \"Spaceballs\", etc. Phase 5 is still 'Coming Soon!'. He hopes to be more like Grune when he grows up.\n\nMichael Barnett \/\/ aka Ash\n\nMike was one of the first hires for 5th Planet, and has the longest tenure. He also has the longest streak of wearing a baseball hat, approaching five years. So, keeping our engineering team operating at full speed, dominating servers and tech stuff, or rocking an awesome hat, Mike is kind of a big deal!\n\nBernard Decrane \/\/ aka Mouse\n\nDwelling high within the mountains overlooking the 5th Planet Games Office lived a Dwarven clan with a lowly population, one such Dwarf resident was Bernard, who defended his clan from foes such as \"Retail\" and \"Cable Customer Support Representative\", after defeating these opponents in deadly combat, (and wrangling some goats along the way) he descended from the mountains to make his new home within the dark recesses of the 5th Planet Games Office's cave system, where he now digs for gems, answers the occasional community question and fends off the worshipers of Nurgle.\n\nJeff Yoon \/\/ aka Jeffy\n\nAfter roaming the streets of LA for a few years with a sign on his neck that said, \"I will draw and paint for food\", Jeff was picked up by the 5th Planet Games team. For some reason, they made him a lead artist\/art director, and he is very thankful that he can now have warm meals and a cozy bed to sleep in.\n\nLenzy Schneider \/\/ aka Schnzy\n\nSchnzy has swapped careers a few times, starting with the US army, and then entering the world of graphic design. But it was a lifelong love of games that led him to 5pg where he now serves as a game designer putting his passions to use and making awesome games!\n\nRyan Harbert \/\/ aka RyanSMASH\n\nIn his teen years, Ryan resided in the Kingdom of Potatoes. A specialist in security of the land, he fended off wanderers and thieves. He was given a chance in demolitions, where he endured unending blasting from the enemy. He quickly grew to an expert in the field, surpassing all competition, but found his true passions pointed towards the mythical 5th Planet. After a long journey, he arrived and began an epic apprenticeship, learning tricks of the trade that residents of 5th Planet have mastered.\n\nKeith Wells \/\/ aka Flynn\n\nKeith spent his formative years designing the palaces of emperors and intergalactic house scions before spending nearly a decade designing the soundscapes of holodecks across the galaxy. Later, perceiving the move of humanity's data into the magellanic clouds of open space, another avenue was embarked upon to become a wrangler of this data and the transition to 5th Planet was made.\nNow, his dreams of \"All your data are belong to me\" are beginning to crystalize, and soon the truth of that plight will be realized by others\u2026 Soon.\n\nEve Milan \/\/ aka Punch\n\nBehold mortal: Eve.

Some day soon, the quiet of normality will fade and she will again find herself striding the battlefield, dispatching our enemies with crushing blows from each of her mighty arms.\n\nKeith Dunng \/\/ aka Toymaker\n\nThe Toymaker awoke, arising in a vast expanse of stillness. The outlandish flora, fauna, and air all hung as if frozen in time. His mission? To restore movement to this world. After a few days and many iterations, his mission was nearly complete with the world moving in almost perfect unison. Only an ancient gateway remained unfinished. Upon breathing life into it, the gateway opened and began inhaling the world he had just completed. It sucked up the Toymaker, where he tumbled through a black nothingness until he lost conciousness.\nThe Toymaker awoke, arising in a vast expanse of stillness...\n\nBrian Foulk \/\/ aka Kodiak\n\nKodiak burst into the offices of 5th Planet Games, and refused to budge when told he was not allowed to sleep there. Now he busies himself with working hard on bettering all 5th Planet-y things and perfecting bear puns.\n\nNorris Eldridge \/\/ aka Helmsman\n\nA man of few words, not much is known of Helmsman. Though it is common belief that he was raised in the dark depths of Majora Mask's dungeons, surviving weeks on end on with nothing but meager rations of Chips Ahoy and Kraft Macaroni & Cheese. While sightings of Helmsman are rare, he can sometimes be found scavenging for food in the 5PG breakroom.\n\nMegan Warmerdam \/\/ aka Gladiatrix\n\nEveryone knows the arenas of West Kruna can be a terrifying and violent place. No one knows this more than a former master of coin, in the stands of the colosseum. Keeping track of wagers and fees dutifully amongst the crowd, she never expected to be bumped off of her post and into the arena itself.\nAfter whittling down a few champions of the Colosseum, the now Gladiatrix found herself in an exciting new line of work.\n\nMiles Deponty \/\/ aka Tails\n\nHaving grown up with a controller in hand, Tails followed his passion for games, creating, helping, and bringing joy to others. After a few years stay at an Art Institute he was finally accepted as a trained scholar. There were plenty of orcs and goblins slayed in the process and using his knowledge and +15 charisma, he was able to persuade Felendis to let him join the 5PG ranks.\n\nAryn Lockhart \/\/ aka MysticMerc\n\nMysticMerc has spent his years adventuring through an expansive amount of worlds. The last few years finding faults and holes in the very fabric of many of them notifying their creators of such flaws. Now while obtaining knowledge in the art of creation himself has found himself at the 5th Planet, creators of exciting and new worlds, to lend his expertise.\n\nDavid Newel \/\/ aka FileNotFound\n\nArmed with a degree of Computer Science knowledge and years experience with arcane, modern languages of Java, Ruby, and C#, the lowly wanderer crawled along the scorched wastes created from his own typed word. Years before, he dug into the mad scrawlings of other programmers before at previous companies longstanding, sometimes delving into the ancient layers of \"legacy code\". In that journey, he has seen Code-thulu several times with his own eyes and each time gone madder with the revelation... :FHTAGN\nNow David works here at 5th Planet Games!\n\n\nEmail: support@5thplanetgames.com\n\nPhone: (916)782-1506",
