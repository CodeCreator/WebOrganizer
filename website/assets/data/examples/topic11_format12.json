Yes, another one.\n\nHosts Tom Bailey and Chris Davies (and, formerly, Tim Owen) have shelves (and hard drives) full of old games they haven\u2019t managed to get to yet. In order to rectify this, they pick a game from each other\u2019s list each week for the other to go away and play. A week later, they come back and discuss their \u2018homework\u2019 before picking next week\u2019s games.\n\nOh, and they record it for your listening pleasure. Quite the treat, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree.\n\nThis site is basic, we realise. It\u2019s early days for the pod and we\u2019ll spruce this place up once we\u2019re properly up and running.
