We are Wilfredo and\u00a0Jeanne, and we are so excited to grow our family again through adoption. Love and laughter overflow from our home and farm here in Maryland. Thank you for taking a moment to get to know us. We are praying for you and for this adoption journey we are both on.\n\nOur Story\n\nWe have been married for 12 years and have always dreamed of having a big family yet, after a few years, we learned that we could not\u00a0conceive.\u00a0 We came to see that God had another plan for our family, adoption. 5 years ago, we were blessed to adopt our daughter Isabel, and now we are excited to grow our family again through adoption.\n\nWe speak Spanish and English at home and Isabel is learning both.\u00a0 We are Catholic and active in our faith, striving to let God\u2019s love and light shine through us.\n\nWe love working on our mini farm together as a family.\u00a0 Every time we try to scale it back, we seem to plant more.\u00a0 Corn, tomatoes, peas, radishes, green beans, peppers, and cucumbers are some favorites! We have chickens who share silly antics as well as lots of fresh eggs.\u00a0 A year ago, we added sheep to the mix, and we love them.\n\nWhen we are not playing farm, we love to sing silly songs, play games, grill or cook together, do craft projects, visit with friends, and enjoy each other\u2019s company.\n\nAbout Wilfredo\n\nWilfredo is a truly kind and generous man, completely committed as a husband and a father. A hard-working provider, he is dedicated to our family. If you are in need, this is the man you want by your side \u2013 he would persevere through any difficulty but make you laugh all the while.\n\nWilfredo runs his own landscaping business. In his free time, you can find him fishing, hiking, grilling, or even occasionally resting in our hammock. Wilfredo is a fantastic father and has so much love to share with our daughter.\n\nI look forward to watching him sharing his love with another child, as he teaches through farm chores or makes up silly games with another child\/children.\n\nAbout Jeanne\n\nJeanne loves being a mom, and all that goes with it. She enjoys cooking and even doing laundry but does not mind when she gets a break from doing dishes. Jeanne is a stay-at-home mom but does help out a few hours a week in the home office of our family business.\n\nJeanne is quiet and thoughtful, with a silly sense of humor and ready to help anyone in need. She loves to be outside- especially in our garden.\u00a0 When she is enjoying downtime, you can often find her reading a book or catching up with old friends. Jeanne is so excited to think of her family growing, and dreams of sharing love, snuggles, stories, and songs with a new child\/children.\n\nOur Daughter Isabel\n\nIsabel radiates laughter and energy wherever she goes. She adores her lambies and takes good care of our baby chicks. Isabel is beyond excited at the idea of being a big sister and would be so proud to help Mama with any new children we were blessed with.\n\nOur Family\n\nWe have a large, loving, and excited extended family, living both nearby and in El Salvador. Wilfredo is the oldest of 5 and Jeanne of 3 and there are aunts, uncles, and cousins of every age and variety. They are all crazy about Isabel and excited for our family to grow again through adoption.\n\nOur Home in Maryland\n\nWe live on about 8 acres in a rural pocket of Maryland, close enough to the city to be able to explore when we desire yet otherwise out in the country. Our home has three bedrooms and is perfectly cozy. We love sharing meals by our woodstove in the winter months and curling up on the sofa with a good book. Most of the time, you will find us outside. Our yard, barns, and gardens offer lots of outdoor spaces for work and play and the nearby river and parks give us even more areas for adventure.\n\nOur Promise to You\n\nWe promise that your child will know unconditional love and support throughout life. We promise to raise your child or children in Faith so that he or she grows to one day be a trustworthy man or woman of integrity and compassion.\n\nWe are happy to be in touch with you as you feel most comfortable, whether that is photos, letters, messages, or visits. We promise that your child will know his or her story\u00a0and will know the love and grace of this adoption journey.\n\nTo learn more about us, please call or text Lifetime at 1.800.923.6784.\n\nLearn More About Wilfredo & Jeanne\n\n\u00a0 Wilfredo Jeanne\nOur EducationHigh School in El SalvadorMasters in Social Work\nOur ProfessionsLandscape Owner\/OperatorStay at home mom\/ Part time at family business\nOur Racial BackgroundHispanicCaucasian\nSome of Wilfredo & Jeanne's Favorites\nThing to grow in the garden:Corn \u2013 a traditional variety from El Salvador I have been perfecting for Maryland weatherSweet Potatoes \u2013 the vines are so green and beautiful and grow well with very little fussing from me\nAnimal to raise:Cows \u2013 we don\u2019t have any yet but that is next on the listTurkeys \u2013 they are totally goofy\nPlace to visit:El Salvador \u2013 there is nowhere quite like the place you grow upEl Salvador \u2013 family is family\nFood:SeafoodChocolate - that\u2019s a food group, right?\nQuote:\u201cI must be willing to give whatever it takes to do good to others.
