LOL. My friends I have totally crazy inside jokes (\"22w\" and \"Monday Night Football\"; don't ask). I am sometimes shy, but usually not. I LOVE to meet new people and make new friends, and I'm really loud and crazy for the most part...except not around adults! My basketball team rocks; we're all really close and love each other; currently I am #41. I go to Berean Baptist Church (BBC) and it's totally awesome! All the Jr. High students there rock! Drama is totally my thing; I am a huge drama queen sometimes. I talk a lot, and probably get really annoying (my friend's brother says I really scare him and sometimes he thinks I'm on drugs 'cuz I get EXTREMELY hyper sometimes) and I text continuously for hours. I <3 all my BFFs to death! I am so awesome, and I'm so cute! (Not really, but I'm trying to be nice to myself.) My life ambition\/goal is to be a songwriter\/singer or a fashion designer or to be in the broadway production of either Hairspray or Wicked. My real name is Kayla, but I'm trying to get the nickname KayKay hooked, so you can call me that if you want, okay? So, yeah, did I mention I homeschool? (And I'm probably smarter than you, lol!)

My biggest positive has been my daughter, she's 4, and is my little partner in crime. I've learned to be a more positive, strong, go-getter type (a lot because of her) which has really made my outlook on life better, and I'm looking forward to finding out what the future holds. My faith has also played a big role and I like to be active with church rather as a leader for a group or just a fun group function we may have one Sunday. At the present moment, I'm working and aback have gone back to college. I've went back to finish my bachlor's degree but with a new major- history. I'm extremely excited, hope to be done in a couple of years and can't wait to see where this new route leads me- maybe a curator (sp?) at a museum?! For free time, I love to do just about anything indoors or outdoors. Music has always been a huge part of my life, especially singing, so I really enjoy any type of music events or performances. Oh, and if I can be in a performance, especially choral wise, I'm there in a heartbeat. Also I find it fun to take the occasional road trip to a park or just travelling in general. Rather it's historical, hiking, or just site seeing- there's so much to learn! I've already been to multiple states (the Southwest is my favorite) and a few countries (Canada, Taiwan, and Vietnam). I'm also looking forward to a possible trip to Italy w\/ my daughter in a few years to see my brother. As for the other part of my spare time, I like to spend it with family and friends. Both of them are incredibly important to me, so I think it would be important for the person I meet to be family oriented and enjoy going out with friends too. In the mean time, I'd really like to find someone who's compassionate, loyal, a communicator, honest, optimistic, loving, and also enjoys going to church now and then. They should also be willing to accept my daughter and love her just as much too. If the last one can't be handled, then need not to apply. :) Otherwise, I'm excited for this new adventure and hope to meet a great person!\n\nHer interests\n\nCoffee and conversation , Cooking , Dining out , Hobbies and crafts , Movies\/Videos , Museums and art , Music and concerts , Exploring new areas , Nightclubs\/Dancing , Performing arts , Religion\/Spiritual , Shopping\/Antiques , Travel\/Sightseeing , Volunteering\n\nSports & exercise\n\nBasketball, Dancing, Football, Running, Soccer, Swimming, VolleyBall, Walking \/ Hiking\n\nI exercise 1-2 times per week.\n\n\n\n\nI have Dogs\n\nI like Cats\n\nI grew up mostly around dogs, so I'm an avid lover of them and just about any breed. I do have one dog, \"Bear\" aka Bubbie or Boo, a boxer\/german shepherd mix. I like cats too, but it takes particular ones to win me over. Never have had one though.\n\nPolitical views\n\nMiddle of the Road\n\nFavorite hot spots\n\nI've been to Vietnam and Canada- love them both. I would like to eventually make it to Europe since there is a lot of culture and art to take in. Local spots, in the summer, I love going to the band shell, in the park, to watch music\/dance events.\n\n\nBluffton University, Bluffton,\u00a0OH\n\nFavorite things\n\nI listen to hip hop, contemporary christian, and country, but I really have diverse tastes. Still the groups from the late 60's-70's are my favorite (Chicago, Guess Who, Lynard Skynard, etc.)I'm not a picky eater, but love asian cuisine(sp?).\n\nFor fun\n\nI love anything that pertains to music, dance, and movies. When I have free time- I enjoy reading, hiking, DIY projects, and being around the ones I love. I've also become more active in church and try to find things that I can do w\/ my daughter.\n\nLast read\n\nUnfortunately, it's been awhile since I've read a good book. I do love All the Lovely Bones and Great Expectations. Otherwise, I read parent magazines or children's books (which are always fun) b\/c of my daughter.\n\nCommunities Z Try a Community Search\n\n{{#each Communities}}\n{{CommunityImage}} {{#unless IsCommon}}\n\nto your\n\n{{\/each}} {{#if ShowMore}} {{\/if}}\n\n\nMore about her Create a profile to see what you share in common \u00bb\n\n\u00a0 Her What she is looking for\nHeight: 5'8\" (172cms) 5'6\" (167cms) to 6'8\" (203cms)\nBody type: About average Slender, About average, Athletic and toned, A few extra pounds\nEyes: Green Blue, Brown, Grey, Green, Hazel\nHair: Dark brown Auburn \/ Red, Black, Light brown, Dark brown, Blonde, Dark blonde\nSmoke: No Way No Way, Yes, but trying to quit\nDrink: Social Drinker Never, Social Drinker\nOccupation: Retail \/ Food services No preference\nI'm a certified STNA and would like to work in a hospice setting if I continue with it.
