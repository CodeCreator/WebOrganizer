The Collective Honduras USA Resistencia = Libre Party\u00a0in the city of New York show in this document that on Nov. 18, 2012, our country Honduras was a victim of the \u00a0worst electoral fraud in its history, while carrying out primary elections, where the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE, for its initials in Spanish) implemented the computer \u00a0system of Transmission of Preliminary Electoral Results (TREP), the same system that was used during the coup to \u201celect\u201d Porfirio Lobo Sosa as president, and inflated the figures when it was obvious that the polls were deserted. The same system has now been used in the recent primaries, a computer system costing millions that also uses cell phones to call the TSE from the polling stations and communicate the results of the voting.\n\n2. We express our rejection to all forms of manipulation of mass media and polling agencies during the electoral process, and reject the lack of commitment to democracy and civil rights by the government institutions headed by Porfirio Lobo Sosa.\n\n3. We reject that in the name of democracy they try to impose fictitious results, with the claim that this is to revive bipartisanship, which received its death sentence the very moment of the military coup on June 28, 2009, and received its epitaph with the resounding triumph of Xiomara Castro de Zelaya and the Libre\u00a0Party\u00a0(Freedom and Re-foundation), even while the bipartisanship system has altered the results of the Libre\u00a0Party, trying to minimize its \u00a0success by subtracting votes it had obtained legitimately.\n\n4. We reject all forms of fraud, including computer fraud, implemented by the TSE, which lacks all credibility by failing to ensure the security of the elections and allowing them to be an instrument of social domination and subjugation of the Honduran people, who since the coup have been inundated by a wave of killings: peasants, workers, teachers, youth, leaders of the National Popular Resistance Front and the libre\u00a0Party.\n\n5. We invite the citizenry to defend their vote in the general elections of November 2013. We demand the dismantling of the TREP system, and all rigged and obsolete forms that only help to commit fraud.\n\n6. If you are a good teacher, teach students what happens in our Honduras: who are the traitors, thieves, and murderers, those who cheat and kill the people. Fill in along with the children the missing pages in textbooks, change what is false. Build a new conscious and courageous citizen, a human being concerned about their country and humanity.\n\n7. We call on the international community: United Nations, Organization of American States, CELAC, and International Commission on Human Rights, not to abandon Honduras and be alert to developments there. \u00a0We demand for future elections the maximum number of observers at a worldwide level.\n\n8. We Condemn: the fraudulent practices of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal of Honduras, through the TREP system, which would like to impose candidates on the Honduran people and, in turn, to minimize the ascension of the emerging Libre\u00a0Party\u00a0(Freedom and Re-foundation) and finally, we demand that those responsible for this electoral crime be brought to trial and be subject to the full force of law.\n\nNew York Dec. 3, 2012\n\nSimple Share Buttons\n\nShare this\nSimple Share Buttons",

Rebecca Lenn, Director of Outreach for Media Matters, did a fabulous presentation on how to combat myths about SNAP in the media. For example, she taught us to \u201cminimize the myth, familiarize the fact.\u201d Too often, when we hear something negative about SNAP, our response is to repeat it and then try to negate it (\u201cSNAP does not have a high fraud rate!\u201d). While admirable, Rebecca explained that this simply reinforces the myth in the mind of the reader or listener. Instead, you want to retell it. Here\u2019s an alternative frame Rebecca provided:\n\nMyth: SNAP has a high rate of fraud and abuse.\n\nRetold Fact: SNAP is doing exactly what it is supposed do and what a democracy would ask of it. It is helping people who need help in hard times. Pundits and politicians who make this claim are turning a blind eye to not just the numbers that show that fraud and abuse are rare, but the seniors, children, and working families for whom SNAP is helping.\n\nAdvice like this is invaluable and only helps us to better educate lawmakers and the public about the truth. This is only one of the many tips Rebecca provided us during the meeting. The call also included shares from volunteers in Iowa, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Washington State about media successes and face-to-face meetings this month. If you were not on the call or want to review it again, please listen to the recording of the call and download the slides and summary of the call from our National Conference Calls page.\n\nRESULTS greatly appreciates Rebecca and Media Matters for appearing on our call. We look forward to working with them again in the future.\n\nQuick News: Invite Staffers to Witnesses Event; Learn Where Your Taxes Go\n\nInvite Congressional Staffers to Witnesses to Hunger Event.

        "text":"Stop the Download Tax on Facebook\nDownload Fairness Coalition\n\n\n\nDownload Fairness Coalition: e-commerce bill highlights need for consumer protection from duplicative taxation on digital goods and services\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Today Senator Durbin reintroduced the Marketplace Fairness Act, a bill that addresses online sales tax collection. The following statement should be attributed to Sam Whitehorn, executive director of the Download Fairness Coalition:\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s introduction of the Marketplace Fairness Act highlights the need for clarity for all tax policies around e-commerce. And, nowhere is uncertainty more prevalent than in the tax policies surrounding the purchase of digital goods and services.\n\n\u201cUnlike their tangible counterparts, digital goods can be sent to anywhere from anywhere, making tax policy extremely difficult. A consumer living in one state may purchase an MP3 from a company in another state while he is traveling in a third state. Today, consumers face a scenario where all three states may tax this purchase.\n\n\u201cLast year our coalition supported the Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act which would provide a framework for how these goods and services are taxed. We are optimistic that this bill will again be introduced. As debate around the Marketplace bill continues, policymakers must ensure that protecting consumers from duplicative taxation on digital products remains a priority and that the focus of any legislation is to foster continued innovation and growth of e-commerce and a the app economy.\u201d\n\nAbout The Download Fairness Coalition\n\nThe Download Fairness Coalition is an organization that educates policymakers about the benefits of the digital economy. The organization is committed to policies that increase access to digital goods and services for all consumers. As an organization formed within the meaning of section 501(c)(4), contributions to the organization are not tax deductible as a charitable contribution for federal income tax purposes.\n\nFor more information visit our web page at dfc01.wpengine.com.\n\n\nLeave A Reply",

        "text":"Dodd and Frank asked to repeal FinReg FOIA exemption\n\n\nThe Sunlight Foundation joined ten organizations today in expressing concern over a provision of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that may hinder the public\u2019s access to SEC oversight information. The full text of the letter and list of signatories is below and on POGO\u2019s website. I wrote about Sunlight\u2019s concerns on Sunday, which focus on FOIA exemptions and subpoena compliance carve-outs.\n\nThus far, two bills have been introduced in Congress to respond to the perceived lack of transparency in the FinReg bill.\n\nFirst, Representative Paul introduced HR 5970, \u00a0which focuses specifically on undoing section 929I, which contains the provision in question.\n\nSecond, Reps. Issa, Towns, and Bachus introduced HR 6038, which establishes data standards for a wide variety of entities affected by the FinReg bill.\n\nAugust 3, 2010\n\nSenator Christopher Dodd Chairman Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs 534 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510\n\nRepresentative Barney Frank Chairman House Committee on Financial Services 2129 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515\n\nDear Chairmen Dodd and Frank:\n\nWe, the undersigned organizations concerned with government accountability and transparency, are writing to express our concerns about Section 929I of the recently passed Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). If interpreted broadly, this provision has the potential to severely hinder the public\u2019s ability to access critical information related to the oversight activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), thereby undermining the bill\u2019s overarching goals of more transparency and accountability.\n\nAs you know, Section 929I states that the SEC cannot be compelled to disclose records or other information obtained from its registered entities\u2014including entities such as hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds that will now be regulated by the SEC\u2014if this information is used for \u201csurveillance, risk assessments, or other regulatory and oversight activities\u201d outlined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.[1]\n\nSEC Chairman Mary Schapiro wrote to you last week defending this provision. She argued that registered entities need to be able to provide the SEC with access to sensitive or proprietary information \u201cwithout concern that the information will later be made public.\u201d She further explained that, prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, \u201cregulated entities not infrequently refused to provide Commission examiners with sensitive information due to their fears that it ultimately would be disclosed publicly.\u201d She also claimed that investment advisers routinely refuse to turn over personal trading records of investment management personnel, \u201cinstead requiring staff to review hard copies of the records on the adviser\u2019s premises,\u201d which \u201cmaterially impacts the staff\u2019s ability to detect insider trading activity.\u201d[2]\n\nThese arguments do not adequately describe the SEC\u2019s existing regulatory authority, and they fail to acknowledge that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) already provides sufficient exemptions to protect against the release of sensitive and proprietary information. Furthermore, the SEC has a troubling history of being overly aggressive in withholding records from the public. For these reasons, we strongly urge you to repeal Section 929I, or to at least curtail the SEC\u2019s broad authority to withhold critical information from the public.\n\nFirst, we are not convinced by Chairman Schapiro\u2019s claim that \u201cexisting FOIA exemptions were insufficient to allay concerns [about public disclosure] due in part to limitations in FOIA.\u201d For instance, Exemption 8 protects matters that are \u201ccontained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.\u201d Chairman Schapiro argues that this exemption may not apply to all registrants, but it\u2019s worth noting that the courts have broadly construed the term \u201cfinancial institutions,\u201d holding that it is not limited to depository institutions and can also include investment advisers.[3] In addition, Exemption 4 protects \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person [that is] privileged or confidential.\u201d The Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) FOIA guide states that this exemption \u201cencourages submitters to voluntarily furnish useful commercial or financial information to the government and it correspondingly provides the government with an assurance that such information will be reliable,\u201d[4] calling into question Chairman Schapiro\u2019s claim that additional exemptions are needed in order for the SEC to collect information from its registered entities.\n\nSecond, the SEC\u2019s track record with FOIA raises additional concerns about giving the agency even more authority to withhold information from the public. Last year, an audit conducted by the SEC Office of Inspector General (OIG) uncovered a wide range of problems related to the SEC\u2019s FOIA operations. We were particularly troubled by the OIG\u2019s finding that the SEC Chief FOIA Officer was not operating in compliance with Executive Order 13392 or the OPEN Government Act; that few FOIA liaisons have written policies and procedures for processing FOIA requests, increasing the risk that the agency is unnecessarily withholding information from the public; and that there is an insufficient separation between the initial FOIA determination and the appeal process. The OIG concluded that the SEC\u2019s FOIA release rate was \u201csignificantly lower when compared to all other federal agencies.\u201d[5]\n\nThe OIG put forth a number of recommendations for correcting the glaring deficiencies in the SEC\u2019s FOIA operations, such as ensuring that accurate searches are made for responsive information, providing guidelines or written policies for all FOIA-related staff that address the concerns raised by the OIG, and ensuring that all FOIA-related staff has access to sufficient legal expertise to process requests in compliance with FOIA. But according to the OIG\u2019s most recent semiannual report to Congress, the SEC has not completed final action on any of these recommendations.[6] Rather than giving the SEC any more leeway to improperly withhold information from the public, we urge you to hold Chairman Schapiro accountable for the excessive delays in implementing the OIG\u2019s recommendations.\n\nThird, we notice that Chairman Schapiro is \u201casking the Commission to issue and publish on our website guidance to our staff that ensures [Section 929I] is used only as it was intended.\u201d The solution for addressing the uncertainty surrounding this provision is not additional guidance. The solution is clarification in the law that public access is vital to accountability and that the existing FOIA exemptions can adequately protect confidential business information provided by regulated entities.\n\nFourth, Chairman Schapiro neglected to mention that the SEC already has the authority to compel registered entities to provide information and records. Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC has the authority to subpoena witnesses and require the production of any records from its registered entities. If these entities fail to comply, the SEC has the authority to suspend these entities, impose significant monetary penalties, and refer cases to DOJ for possible criminal proceedings.[7] But instead of using these existing authorities, Chairman Schapiro seems to think that Congress needs to provide blanket FOIA exemptions in order to convince the SEC\u2019s registered entities to cooperate. We think such a blanket exemption fosters an environment that defers to the entities it regulates and is unadvisable.\n\nFinally, it is unclear what Chairman Schapiro\u2019s plans are for implementing other blanket FOIA exemptions in the Dodd-Frank Act, such as Section 404, which exempts the SEC from FOIA with respect to any \u201creport, document, record, or information\u201d received from investment advisers to private funds.\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, the need for greater transparency in our financial system is all too apparent. The SEC\u2019s ongoing effort to withhold vital records from the public undermines the spirit of the transparency reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act, and flies in the face of President Obama\u2019s guidance instructing agencies to adopt a \u201cpresumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher in a new era of open Government.\u201d[8]\n\nWe call on you to repeal the unnecessary FOIA exemption in Section 929I, examine the SEC\u2019s current record on withholding information, and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the SEC isn\u2019t given any additional authority to keep its records under a veil of secrecy. We welcome an opportunity to discuss this issue with you further.

        "text":"An Informed Discussion on Combating Abuse\n\nAs part of the the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence, the Brantford-Brant Women\u2019s Liberal Club hosted a discussion on combating abuse and programs available for men and women facing abuse. We were fortunate to have a special guest speaker from Nova Vita Domestic Violence Prevention Services to lead the discussion.\n\nIn 1991, the Center for Women\u2019s Global Leadership convened the first Women\u2019s Global Leadership Institute (WGLI).\n\nThe 23 participants came from different countries in all of the world\u2019s regions and were drawn from a variety of fields \u2013 lawyers, policymakers, teachers, health care workers, researchers, journalists, and activists.\n\nThese women were local civil society leaders with at least two years of experience in women\u2019s organizing who were also interested in building the global women\u2019s human rights movement.\n\nDuring the WGLI, participants discussed different aspects of gender-based violence and human rights, learning from one another\u2019s experiences and consequently developing strategies to increase international awareness of the systemic nature of violence against women and to expose this violence as a violation of women\u2019s human rights.\n\nWhile violence against women takes different forms according to its cultural context, the problem exists everywhere and working on the issue offers unique opportunities to build bridges across cultures, to learn from both similarities and differences, and to link strategies globally.\n\nThe Liberal Party of Canada and Justin Trudeau have been encouraging all Canadians to think about how their actions matter and to stand up against gender based violence.\n\nThis is why we have decided the most fitting local program to raise awareness is Nova Vita.\n\nNova Vita is a local women\u2019s shelter that offers programs that help women build confidence and self reliance through transitional hoping and support and referrals to other community resources.\n\nThey also offer assistance to women and children trapped in an abusive home through outreach visits and educational workshops held at schools, libraries, churches and other community gathering places.\n\nOur special guest and speaker for the evening was Brianna Kerr, who educated us on Nova Vita, their programs, and the need for more funding and assistance to those who are victims of abuse.\n\nThank you to all who attended, all who brought donations, and a special thanks to Brianna!\n\nFor more information on Nova Vita, please like their Facebook page or visit their web site.\n\n\n2017-01-03T09:44:09+00:00December 6th, 2016|Community Outreach, Events, Roundtable, Women's Club|",
