Never a stranger to provoking controversy, Brand has been fired or suspended from show business jobs throughout his career. That hasn't stopped him from always speaking his mind and trying to get reactions out of audiences. With an appearance that's equal parts gothic, glam-rock and drag queen, Brand is both the Mick Jagger and the Keith Richards of comedy.\n\nIn the Beginning:\n\nRussell Brand was born and raised by a single mother in Grays, Essex, England. A lifelong performer and budding young actor, Brand didn't make his stage debut until age 15 when he starred in his school musical. He attended several prestigious drama schools, including Italia Conti Academy and Drama Centre London. While attending the latter school, Brand developed a substance abuse problem and became addicted to heroin. He was expelled from the school in his final term there.\n\nA New Stand-up:\n\nIn 2000, Brand finished fourth in the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year comedy finals, announcing his arrival as a stand-up comic. The same year, he made his first appearance at the Edinburgh Festival, where he would return to several times over the next decade.\n\nIn 2004, Brand returned to Edinburgh with his first one man show, Better Now, which chronicled his struggle with heroin. He brought his next show, Eroticised Humor, in 2005.\n\nRussell Brand Tours and Comedy Releases:\n\nIn 2006, Brand embarked on his first nationwide tour of England with his show Shame, which was later released on DVD under the title Russell Brand Live. He toured again in 2007 with the show Russell Brand: Only Joking, released on DVD as Russell Brand: Doin' Life.\n\nConquering the U.S.:\n\nIn 2008, Brand gained mainstream recognition in the United States with a major role in the romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Later that same year, he garnered even more attention when he hosted the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nBeginning in 2006, Brand hosted a BBC radio show called The Russell Brand Show. In October of 2008, Brand and his co-host, DJ Johnathan Ross, made phony phone called to a British actor as a prank. The BBC, deeming the calls obscene, suspended Brand from his show. He resigned shortly thereafter.\n\nBrand continues to record a weekly podcast.\n\nIn March of 2009, Comedy Central premiered Brand's first U.S. stand-up special, Russell Brand in New York. The same month, his autobiography My Booky Wook was released in the U.S. (having been released in the U.K. in 2007).\n\nIn 2010, Brand headlined the comedy Get Him to the Greek, in which he reprised his Forgetting Sarah Marshall role as rock star Aldous Snow.\n\nAdditonal Russell Brand Facts:\n\n  \u2022 Brand has been a vegetarian since age 14.\n  \u2022 He suffers from bipolar disorder and has struggled with bulimia in the past.\n  \u2022 Brand was hired as a VJ for MTV in England in 2000, but was fired after showing up dressed as Osama Bin Laden one day after September 11, 2001.\n  \u2022 He has hosted at least a dozen different shows in the UK, including several Big Brother spinoffs, the Brit Awards and part of Comic Relief.\n  \u2022 In 2006, he was named Best Stand-up by Time Out and won Best Newcomer at the British Comedy Awards.\n  \u2022 In 2007, Brand was named as one of the 100 best stand-ups by England's Channel 4.\n  \u2022 He had his own FX talk show, Brand X, beginning in 2012. The show was canceled in 2013.\nRelated Video\n  1. About.com\n  2. Entertainment\n  3. Comedians\n  4. Current Comedians\n  5. Comedians A - L\n  6.

A supporting character in the The Fast and the Furious series, Bilkins was involved in the undercover operation to expose a series of thefts in Los Angeles connected to illegal street racer Dominic Toretto and later, the capture and arrest of Miami drug lord, Carter Verone.\n\n\nThe Fast and the Furious\n\nBilkins was assigned to oversee the LAPD-FBI task force in charge of apprehending Dominic Toretto and his crew, local street racers they suspected were behind multiple semi-truck hijackings in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAgent Bilkins supervised Brian O'Conner's activity during his undercover operation regarding Dominic Toretto. Despite Sergeant Tanner's confidence in Brian's ability to maintain his cover and focus on his objective, Bilkins was up front about expressing his doubts about Brian's ability to complete the operation.\n\nBrian's repeated stalls during the operation frustrated Bilkins, who was ready to take Dominic down. Despite the reveal of Dominic's violent past, Brian failed to produce the evidence Bilkins and Tanner needed. Though Brian manages to arrange an arrest for Johnny Tran, Tran is found not guilty of any crimes.\n\n2 Fast 2 Furious\n\nAgent Bilkins reappears once more, now overseeing a U.S Customs-FBI operation attempting to take down Argentine drug lord Carter Verone. Using an undercover Customs agent, Monica Fuentes, Bilkins is able to locate Brian in Miami, who is now participating in illegal street races for a living. Following Brian's arrest, Bilkins and Markham try to convince Brian to help them expose and take down Verone. Bilkins used the multiple felonies Brian committed in Los Angeles to bring him onto the case, but with the request that he got to choose the partner who'll go undercover with him.\n\nBilkins agreed to Brian's terms and accompanied him to Barstow, California to recruit Roman Pearce, his childhood friend. Bilkins willingly sat and watched Brian and Roman's fight until Roman was convinced that helping them would be worth his time. When Roman asked, Bilkins confirmed that his helping the FBI catch Verone would end with his and Brian's criminal records being erased. Bilkins monitored Brian and Roman's progress in the company of Verone and Fuentes, and was informed of the situation whenever the two checked in to report their progress.\n\nWhen the time came to arrest Verone, Bilkins monitored Markham's sting at the airport and Roman and Brian's situation from Customs HQ. Roman and Brian's chase leads the police to a warehouse. During the racers scramble, Bilkins assumes that Brian and Roman are still driving the Spyder and Evo. However, when the cars are cornered, Tej Parker and Suki are found instead.\n\n\n\nBilkins is a veteran agent in the FBI with the rank of Special Agent. During the events of The Fast and the Furious, Bilkins is openly mistrustful of Brian's loyalty to the LAPD and his undercover mission, despite Tanner's faith in the cop. Bilkins is willing to get the job done through whatever means he possibly can, and spares little sympathy. He is seemingly proven right when Brian lets Dominic Toretto go free and abandons the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nIn 2 Fast 2 Furious, Bilkins's opinion of Brian appears to have shifted. Bilkins is more than willing to go along with Brian's way of handling his assignment with Verone, placing more trust in his abilities despite Agent Markham's severe doubts in his Brian's loyalty.\n\n\nTransparent Gallery Button\nThe The Fast and the Furious Wiki has a collection of images and media related to Bilkins.\n\n\nAd blocker interference detected!\n\nWikia is a free-to-use site that makes money from advertising.

        "text":"primarily a form of ovation; usually by the act of clapping, or striking the palms of the hands together, in order to create noise\n\nApplause is the sound made by an audience who are clapping their hands (applauding) to thank someone for a performance. People at a concert usually applaud when the performers come onto the stage. This is a way of welcoming them. At the end of a performance people applaud again to thank the performers.\n\nPeople may applaud after someone makes a speech or at a sporting match. They will applaud after a play in the theatre or at the end of an opera. The length of applause (how long they applaud for) may depend on how much they liked the performance. If they liked it very much they may also shout \"BRAVO!\". When an audience applauds with really wild excitement it is called an \"ovation\". Very occasionally (in English-speaking cultures) an audience might all stand up as well. This is called a \"standing ovation\".\n\nRelated pagesEdit",

Cheek.) The firm designed the Highland Park Village Shopping Center, which was established in 1929 and gradually expanded. Cheek\u2019s friend, artist Reveau Bassett, painted the murals in the Village Theatre. I\u2019m not sure if any of the murals have survived.\n\nrivest266 on October 23, 2013 at 3:32 pm\n\nNovember 15th, 1935 grand opening ad uploaded here.\n\ndallasmovietheaters on October 28, 2013 at 6:01 pm\n\nOne of the original murals is hung at the TXCN headquarters downtown and all survived.\n\ndallasmovietheaters on November 3, 2013 at 7:33 am\n\nThe Highland Park Spanish Village Shopping Center was an ambitious and many say the second ever shopping center created in the United States. The $1.5 million center started construction in 1930 with a theater in its original planning. In May of 1931, the Hughes-Franklin Theatre Circuit led by Harold B. Franklin and Howard Hughes which had built the Texas Theater drew up a 1,400 screen theater at a cost of $250,000 that was to be that theater. However, Franklin left the company and plans dissolved.\n\nThe Village shopping center opened in 1933 without a theater. Those same plans were picked up by Flippen-Prather Stores which leased the theater to the Interstate Theater Circuit which did cost-cutting reducing the 1,400 seat theater to a $150,000 house. The theater\u2019s Spanish architectural style perfectly matched the shopping center\u2019s design. Inside, the lobby had large murals depicting the history of Texas to present by James Buchanan \u201cBuck\u201d Winn Jr. Blue walls and ceilings, terrazo floor and heavy oak doors with leather panels gave the interior its look at its grand opening on November 15, 1935 with the film, \u201cThe Dark Angel.\u201d\n\nInterstate ran the theater as a second-run suburban and did a remodel of the theater reducing seat count to 1,164 wider seats and new wall treatments. It repositioned the theater as a first-run house in 1957. That policy continued into 1960 when it played a Disney film that was outgrossing the larger downtown houses. Interstate ran family-oriented fare to huge profits throughout the 1960s. A 1966 fire ruined the theater\u2019s original spire and the building now in the hands of Henry S. Miller spent $85,000 to make the repairs.\n\nInterstate successfully ran the theater for 40 years but decided not to renew its lease and dropped the theater. In 1976, the B&B Circuit took over under Fred Beirsdorf and Harold Brooks. They made two decisions that extended the Village\u2019s life: 1) they twinned the theater creating a balcony screen and a main screen and 2) they added midnight shows in 1976 starting with \u201cGimme Shelter.\u201d The latter moved proved beneficial because the theater booked \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\u201d in 1977. Locals protested to the theater owners and Henry S. Miller about the types that were coming to the show to no avail. \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\u201d ran a nine year engagement into the summer of 1986, unprecedented to that point. B&B had declared bankruptcy in 1985 and there was some finger pointing over the closing of the Village in July 1986. Rumor had it that the days of theatrical were over as the theater would become retail space and that the relator were to blame; others pointed the other direction.\n\nThings settled down in 1987, AMC created a four-plex in the Village signing a lease with Henry S. Miller with one stipulation: there would be no showing of \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show.\u201d All screens were up a short escalator flight up through the concession area with the largest screen now 250 seats and the other three had 110 and 120 seats for 600 total seats. AMC successfully operated it for more than 13 years.\n\nRegent Entertainment took over when AMC left the Village in 2001. Operating one of the most unusual venues in Dallas film history, the Regent Village set a box office mark that was seen as quite remarkable when the film Zzyzx Road took in just $30 during a run in 2006 made worse by refunding of $10 to two people who had worked on the film. Regent played many Dallas exclusives that either played nowhere else in the United States or at just its Regent screen in Los Angeles. For independent film lovers, the Regent offered an eclectic mix along with general first-run fare. On its last day in 2009, you could choose to see a film called $9.99 or The Hangover.\n\nWhen the Regent closed in 2009, the shopping center was under new ownership and there was concern that the theater might not continue. But the owners found a new operator and the theater was gutted and reopened Dec. 18, 2010 by Twomey Concepts. As of the 2010s, Twomey operated the theater as a high end restaurant\/bar with screens and viewing lounges mixing predominately family fare with some independent films.\n\nJackCoursey on November 3, 2013 at 8:19 am\n\nTo be clear, nothing of the original interior remains in place. The theater was completely gutted, top to bottom. The four conventional auditoriums on the second level are architecturally on par with just about every mall multiplex designed between the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is a rather basic venue at best and a real shame nothing could have been done to keep the place intact. Still, it does have a nice exterior.\n\nfrank gagliano\nfrank gagliano on August 25, 2014 at 1:11 am\n\nThanks for the extensive history on the Village Theater. I saw The Natural at this theater in 1983 in the converted balcony theater. On my way out I peaked into the main auditorium which was still in original form at the time, it was exquisitely 1930s and had a great feel.\n\nIt was a real loss that this theater was gutted and its original architecture lost, but at least it can be said that people have been enjoying cinema in this building for nearly 80 years, that\u2019s quite a run.\n\nObviously, the theater\u2019s spanish mission architecture was inspired by architect S. Charles Lee who designed such theaters all over Southern California. In fact, this Dallas theater is similar in many, many ways to the Village Fox in Westwood next to UCLA, which was built in 1930. Check out its photos on this site to see the resemblance.\n\nThe value of theaters like the Village, when preserved in their original state, is immense. They provide a sense of character to a community that no multiplex will ever provide, no matter how fancy or large. Just tonight, I saw a showing of Frozen at the El Capitan in Hollywood, an incredibly beautiful movie palace that is leased and operated by Disney. The theater was as much an entertainment as the movie. See photos of it too on this site.\n\nDavidZornig on January 29, 2016 at 5:23 pm\n\nCirca 1960 photo added courtesy of the AmeriCar The Beautiful Facebook page.\n\nYou must login before making a comment.\n\nNew Comment\n\nSubscribe Want to be emailed when a new comment is posted about this theater?\nJust login to your account and subscribe to this theater",

        "text":"Monkey News\n\nFrom [[Main_Page|Pilkipedia]], the Karl Pilkington encyclopaedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nFor the blog created by Ricky Gervais see Monkey News (blog)\n\n\n\"What we're doing here, right, is just giving you a bit of monkey news that's gone on, where a monkey's been involved in it. Good little story an' that.\" - Karl Pilkington (The Ricky Gervais Podcast, 5 December 2005)\n\nMonkey News (originally Chimpanzee That) was a regular feature of the Xfm radio shows, and some podcasts, in which Karl re-tells a story he has read about a monkey or an ape. The stories are usually very loosely based on a factual report he has read on the Internet where monkeys (or more often, chimpanzees) have done something very unusual or human-like. Ricky Gervais introduces this section with a jingle: \"Ooooh, Chimpanzee That! MONKEYNEWS yerff-cc--grr\", as is usually the case with other features of the show. On the final show of the first series of The Ricky Gervais Show podcasts, Karl announced he would no longer be doing \"Monkey News\" as he believes all news featuring monkeys has been covered.\n\n\nHairy Chinese Kid and other hirsute children were mentioned by Karl many times in Series 1 and early in Series 2 of the Xfm shows; many people see this as the precursor to Monkey News. In episode 22 of series 2 Karl tells Ricky and Steve of a chimpanzee with human traits (such as drinking brandy and flirting with women!) - this is his first telling of the story of Oliver the Humanzee. The following week (Series 2, Episode 23) sees this become a proper weekly feature of the show for the first time (called Chimpanzee That) complete with its own jingle, performed by Ricky (\"Ooooh, Chimpanzee That!\"). In Episode 30 of series 2 the feature is referred to as Monkey News for the first time, rather than Chimpanzee That, but the Monkey News jingle is not used.\n\nFactual Accuracy\n\nThroughout the history of Monkey News, the factual accuracy of the stories reported is consistently questioned by both Ricky and Steve. They are sometimes so incredulous of the Monkey News story, they take it as accepted that the story is false and proceed to question how Karl can even believe the story is possible. Karl consistently denied that Monkey News was inaccurate, however in Series 1, Episode 3 of the The Ricky Gervais Show podcasts, Karl defends his newest Monkey News stating, \"I'm telling you what, I know sometimes I step over the mark and [the Monkey News stories] are made up-\". This is the first time Karl has admitted that some Monkey News stories have been false. It was not clarified whether this was an admission that he, himself, had made up the Monkey News stories or whether he had merely reported stories that were later proved to be untrue.\n\nList Of Monkey News Items\n\nXfm Shows\n\nRadio 2 Shows\n\nThe Ricky Gervais Show Podcast\n\n  \u2022 Podcast - Series 1\n    \u2022 Series 1 Episode 1: Monkey in space (visits the Moon), wasn't allowed to go back in space, ends up commiting suicide because couldn't reach \"the buzz\" similar to space traveling any other way\n    \u2022 Series 1 Episode 2: Monkey bargain hunter\n    \u2022 Series 1 Episode 3: Monkey Sanctuary where women workers were encouraged to bare their breasts to the gorillas.

He is often credited as Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.\n\nJohnson was a college football player. In 1991, he was part of the University of Miami's national championship team. He later played for the Calgary Stampeders in the Canadian Football League, and was cut two months into the 1995 season. This led to his decision to become a professional wrestler like his grandfather, Peter Maivia, and his father, Rocky Johnson. He gained mainstream fame as a wrestler in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), originally known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), from 1996 to 2004, and was the first third-generation superstar in the company's history. Johnson was quickly given a push as a heroic character in the WWF, originally billed as \"Rocky Maivia\", and then as \"The Rock\". He would subsequently turn into a villain as a member of the Nation of Domination in 1997. Two years after he joined the WWF, Johnson won the WWF Championship, and became one of the most popular wrestlers within the company's history for his engaging interviews and promos.\n\nJohnson won a total of 16 championships in WWF\/E. This included nine World Heavyweight Championships (the WWF\/E Championship seven times and the WCW\/World Championship twice), two WWF Intercontinental Championships, and five times as co-holder of the WWF Tag Team Championships. He was the sixth WWF\/E Triple Crown Champion, and the winner of the 2000 Royal Rumble.\n\nThis article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.\nIt uses material from the Wikipedia article \"Dwayne Johnson.\"",

Produced by Studio Rikka and DIRECTIONS, Inc., the series streamed on Yahoo! Japan from August 1, 2008 to September 18, 2009, with simulcasts by Crunchyroll. The official website mentions the series as \"first season\", leaving the second season a possibility, but it has not since been confirmed. A theatrical version of Time of Eve premiered in Japan on March 6, 2010.\n\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, androids have come into common usage. Rikuo Sakisaka, who has taken robots for granted for his entire life, one day discovers that Sammy, his home android, has been acting independently and coming and going on her own. He finds a strange phrase recorded in her activity log, \"Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?\". He, along with his friend Masakazu Masaki, traces Sammy's movements and finds an unusual cafe, \"The Time of Eve\". Nagi, the barista, informs them that the cafe's main rule is to not discriminate between humans and androids. Within the cafe, androids do not display their status rings, and, when patrons depart, the door is automatically locked for two minutes to prevent someone from following them to discover their true nature.\n\nThe first few episodes involve conversations between Rikuo (usually accompanied by Masaki) and the cafe regulars: the bubbly Akiko, child Chie and her elderly guardian, the lovers Koji and Rina, and others. These conversations make frequent allusion to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, often highlighting surprising interpretations of those laws, some of which form apparent loopholes. The overarching plot involves the beginnings of independence displayed by the androids, what they do with that independence within the bounds of the three laws, and what motivates them. Secondary plots involve the individual stories of each android the protagonists encounter in the cafe, and how they come to discover which patrons are androids and which are not.\n\n\nMain characters[edit]\n\nRikuo Sakisaka (\u5411\u5742 \u30ea\u30af\u30aa Sakisaka Rikuo?)\nVoiced by: Jun Fukuyama (Japanese), Yuri Lowenthal (English)\nRikuo is a high school student and a very talented piano player. After winning the grand prize at a competition where a robot was the guest pianist, he decides to give up playing, since the robot played so well that he was moved by the performance. Like most other people, he treats robots and androids like appliances. He becomes curious of Sammy's activities when he notices that she comes and goes from the apartment at odd times. While reviewing her activity and GPS log, he finds an entry that says, \"Are you enjoying the Time of EVE?\" Retracing her steps, he discovers the cafe, Time of Eve, where humans and robots are treated as equals.\nInitially fearful of Sammy's independence, he begins to learn that she is more human than he first thought. This enables him to let go of his former prejudice against androids and take up the piano once more.\nMasakazu Masaki (\u771f\u5d0e \u30de\u30b5\u30ab\u30ba Masaki Masakazu?)\nVoiced by: Kenji Nojima, Y\u016bko Sanpei (child) (Japanese), Michael Sinterniklaas (English)\nHis father consistently calls him Masakazu or Masa, although Akiko once refers to him as Masa. Everyone else simply calls him Masaki. Masaki is Rikuo's best friend and an honors student. Masaki claims not to have robots at home but in fact has a household robot designated THX, whom he calls Tex. He distrusts robots and helps Rikuo to investigate Sammy's covert activities. His distrust of robots stems from feeling betrayed by Tex as a child. Tex was Masaki's primary source of emotional support at a time when his mother and father were separating. However, Masaki's father, an anti-robot activist, commanded the robot never to speak again. Masaki blames Tex for being undependable at a time he needed him the most and believes they are incapable of emotions and empathy.\nAt the film's conclusion, Tex was able to defend Masaki from an android sent by the Ethics Committee. At the same time he was able to relay his true thoughts and emotions that he was holding back for several years. This resulted in Masaki accepting androids once more.\nSammy (\u30b5\u30df\u30a3 Samyi?)\nVoiced by: Rie Tanaka (Japanese), Elizabeth Boyle (English)\nSammy is the Sakisaka family's household android, who has the appearance of a young woman. At home, Sammy's behavior is passive and emotionless. At the Time of Eve, she refers to Rikuo, Naoko, and their parents as her family. She wishes to make the members of her family happy, but is aware that demonstrating independence, even for their benefit unsettles Rikuo who is the only one aware. Sammy therefore lies about doing anything out of the ordinary when Rikuo questions her activities.\nWhile Sammy appears emotionless as an android, she is very insecure and afraid of hurting others, especially Rikuo. She would therefore do things covertly such as taking detours during her regular schedules or attempting the piano late at night when no one is awake.\nNagi (\u30ca\u30ae?)\nVoiced by: Rina Sato (Japanese), Stephanie Sheh (English)\nNagi is the barista at the Time of Eve. She carefully manages the coffee shop and enforces the rule that there must be no discrimination between humans and robots. Nagi is occasionally unsure of how to handle some of the situations that occur in the cafe, leaving open the question as to whether she is an android for most of the series. It is eventually revealed that, as a child of five, she is the human that the Ethics Committee injured in the notorious Tokisaka Incident 8 years prior to the series.\nAfter the credits, Nagi was seen entering a house (assuming hers, because she said \"Tadaima\", which means \"I'm home\" in English). She was then shown talking to Shiotsuki, her father, who was the original creator of androids. She told him he should be happy because his \"children\" (androids) are laughing along with humans out there, and soon it'll extend beyond the cafe.\n\nTime of Eve regulars[edit]\n\nAkiko (\u30a2\u30ad\u30b3?)\nVoiced by: Yukana (Japanese), Cassandra Lee Morris (English)\nAkiko is the first customer whom Rikuo and Masaki meet at the Time of Eve. She talks very fast, asks a lot of questions, and jokes around. While at first thought to be human, Akiko is later revealed to be an android when she goes to greet her master at Rikuo's school. Like Sammy, outside the cafe she is passive and emotionless, even to Rikuo and Masaki. Although passive to the duo, Akiko is aware of them as she is seen secretly smiling after walking past their window.\nKoji (\u30b3\u30fc\u30b8 K\u014dji?)\nVoiced by: Michio Nakao (Japanese), Derek Stephen Prince (English)\nAlong with Rina, Koji is a customer that Rikuo and Masaki formally meet after Akiko. He is a male-form android whose master is a woman who prefers his company to that of human men. Believing that Rina is a human woman very similar to his master, he befriended Rina at the Time of Eve in order to learn how to be a better boyfriend to his master. Koji would later grow to like Rina for herself. He conceals his nature from Rina because he believes that she would leave him if she were to find out that he is an android.\nKoji was initially thought to be a human dori-kei for almost half the film as he carries their characteristics. This was later revealed to be false which opens up the possibility that love can form between androids the same way it does between humans.\nRina (\u30ea\u30ca?)\nVoiced by: Miki Ito (Japanese), Lisa Ortiz (English)\nRina is a female-form android bodyguard who has been illegally modified by her former master, an unidentified VIP, to be capable of sexual activity. Her right leg was damaged during an assassination attempt on her master, at which point he abandoned her. Her leg malfunctions periodically, threatening to reveal her identity as an android. Since she's been illegally modified, she cannot go back to her manufacturer for repair without embarrassing her former master. Without a current master, she is technically on the run from the authorities. She befriends and falls in love with Koji as he is both kind and thoughtful. Rina believes that Koji is human and fears that he would abandon her if he were to find out that she is an android.\nShimei (\u30b7\u30e1\u30a4?)\nVoiced by: Motomu Kiyokawa (Japanese), George S. Cole (English)\nShimei is the foster parent of Chie. He is a prototype android designed to act in place of a human parent, undergoing a secret public test. Presumably, as an android being publicly tested in secret, he would not display a halo in public. However, he freely admits that he is an android, but only when Nagi (and Chie) cannot hear him do it. Shimei has yet to reveal his nature to Chie.\nChie (\u30c1\u30a8?)\nVoiced by: Miyuki Sawashiro (Japanese), Alice A. Johnson (English)\nChie is a young girl of about four years old, although her age is never revealed. She loves to steal and hide the belongings of others in order to get them to play with her. Rikuo meets her, along with Shimei, when she becomes fascinated with Rikuo's glasses and soon steals and hides them. She is fond of declaring herself to be a cat. She does not understand why Shimei leaves her in the care of others once a month for his regular maintenance check and does not even suspect that he is an android.\nSetoro (\u30bb\u30c8\u30ed?)\nVoiced by:...

The screenplay based on a 1929 play of the same name by Martin Flavin was written by Fred Niblo Jr. and Seton I. Miller, who were nominated for Best Adaptation at the 4th Academy Awards.\n\nThe film is the first of three film adaptations released by Columbia Pictures that adapted from the play The Criminal Code. It was followed by Penitentiary 1938) and Convicted (1950).\n\n\nSix years of stress and hard labor working in the prison jute mill has taken its toll on young Robert Graham. The penitentiary's resident doctor and psychiatrist recommends that Warden Brady see him and proposes that he offer him a drastic change of environment and duties before his psychological damages become irreversible. When the warden realizes who the inmate is, or rather was, and recalls that it was he that helped put him behind bars (as with many of the prisoners), he agrees to give him a chance and offers him a job as his valet. Graham enjoys his new employment, especially since he is frequently in the company of the warden's pretty young daughter, Mary. He improves in general character and demeanor and regains his morale.\n\nMeanwhile, one of Graham's cellmates tries to escape at night with two other prisoners. One turns out to be a stool pigeon, breaking the Prisoner's code of silence and lures the men into a death trap. The guards brutally shoot down and kill Graham's cellmate. Ned Galloway, Graham's other cellmate, vows to avenge this death and, more importantly, punish the violator of the unwritten code. He develops an elaborate plan secretly to murder the culprit and carefully warns Graham to stay away from the man. Ill-fated Graham, of course, walks in on the crime no one was supposed to witness.\n\nUpon finding Graham with the dead body, the perspicacious warden again knows that Graham is not the murderer. He does however clearly see that Graham knows who committed the crime. Promising him a speedy parole, though his sincerity is somewhat doubtful, the warden pushes Graham to reveal the name of the killer. He is morally torn. Still an inmate, Graham cannot bring himself to go against the Prisoner's Code and remains loyal to Galloway and the other inmates, who in this case represent the Hawksian group, an ever-present theme in the director's films. The situation also deeply troubles Brady, who feels impelled to send Graham to \"the hole,\" hoping it will change his mind.\n\nA week or so later, after a short trip, Mary returns home to the penitentiary and is surprised not to see Graham working as valet. Her surprise turns to shock when she finds out where Graham has been sent. She urges her father to release him. The warden criticizes his daughter for her na\u00efvet\u00e9, but reconsiders her plea once she proclaims her love for Graham. Along with Gleason and a few guards, he descends into the prison dungeon to let out the devastated prisoner. The other inmates logically think that Graham has spoken the name of the killer. Having previously smuggled a pocket knife down to another man in the hole, they hope Graham will be punished for squealing.\n\nGalloway, on the other hand, understands what is really happening. He purposely insults a guard in the jute mill and is promptly sent downstairs faithfully to protect his cellmate and loyal friend. Once in the dungeon, he kills the other prisoner and, in addition, cuts Gleason's throat. (The Yard Captain was, in fact, the man responsible for Galloway's lengthy incarceration). The other guards finally shoot him down. Graham, safe and unharmed, is immediately sent up to see Mary Brady. The two lovers embrace passionately for the first time.\n\n\n\nThe Criminal Code was adapted for the screen by Seton I. Miller and Fred Niblo, Jr., son of director Fred Niblo. The original play by San Francisco Bay Area native author and playwright Martin Flavin was produced on Broadway in 1929 at the Belasco Theater. Boris Karloff, who delivered a strong performance in the stage play, is recast here as Galloway. This film served as the vehicle which would essentially launch his career. Though appearing in dozens of pictures during the 1920s, he had mostly bit parts.\n\nThe Criminal Code was the first of Hawks' four collaborations with Harry Cohn, the others being Twentieth Century, Only Angels Have Wings and His Girl Friday. It is Hawks' only picture with Frank Fouce, who produced only five films, all in 1931. Hawks worked with screenwriter Seton Miller several times in the late 1920s and early 1930s. This is the only occasion he worked with Niblo, Jr. Stock footage from the film was used by Columbia in the following year's Behind the Mask, which also featured Cummings and Karloff, but in different roles.[citation needed]\n\n\nThough an early talkie, The Criminal Code makes a sophisticated use of sound. The intercourse is at times rapid and Hawks seems to be experimenting with overlapping dialogue.\n\nLike other prison films of the 1930s, such as San Quentin and Each Dawn I Die, The Criminal Code encouraged its viewers to question the contemporary American legal and penal systems.\n\nHawks easily exploits the prison genre to illustrate the male friendship and 'group as an organic force' themes often present in his works (cf. Only Angels Have Wings, Rio Bravo). This is most apparent in the scene in which Brady starts his first day of work as warden, greeted by a prison yard full of men booing him as if they were but one man. The warden (and the camera) peer down on them from the office window.\n\nConstance Cummings is a far cry from, say Lauren Bacall, and has little to work with here, a small part with lackluster lines. Nonetheless, she does not fail to represent the typical Hawksian woman. Her character is strong and, to a certain degree, stoic. She inhabits an utterly masculine world. Yet, although she can leave, she prefers to stay and live at the penitentiary (cf. Mary Rutledge in Barbary Coast).\n\n\n\nThe Criminal Code was presented on Philip Morris Playhouse March 2, 1952. The 30-minute adaptation starred Dane Clark and University of Minnesota student Peggy Baskerville.[1]\n\nForeign language versions[edit]\n\nA Spanish language version entitled El c\u00f3digo penal was directed by Phil Rosen, which stars Barry Norton, Mar\u00eda Alba, and Carlos Villar\u00edas. It had its world premiere in Mexico City on February 19 1931, followed by its American opening in San Juan, Puerto Rico on March 14, and the New York opening on April 14 1931.\n\nA French version entitled Criminel was produced in 1932 by Forrester-Parant Productions, and directed by Jack Forrester. It stars Harry Baur and Jean Servais, and made use of certain scenes from the English-language version.[2]\n\n\nIn 1938, Columbia Pictures remade the picture, and titled it Penitentiary. It was directed by John Brahm and starred Walter Connolly and John Howard.[3]\n\nIn 1950, the film was again remade as Convicted, directed by Henry Levin, and starring Glenn Ford and Broderick Crawford.[4]\n\n\n  1. ^ Kirby, Walter (March 2, 1952). \"Better Radio Programs for the Week\".

        "text":"Marion Burns\n\nAge: 107\nBirthplace: Los Angeles, California\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMarion Burns (9 August 1907 \u2013 22 December 1993) was an American film actress of the 1930s. She is best known for having starred opposite John Wayne in the 1935 film The Dawn Rider and opposite him again that same year in Paradise Canyon.\n\nBurns was born in Los Angeles, California, making her way to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting. She received her first film role in 1931, starring opposite Bill Cody in Oklahoma Jim. That film started her on the path of starring in western films as a heroine. In 1932 she starred opposite George O'Brien in The Golden West, followed by Me and My Gal that same year. 1934 and 1935 would be her biggest years, with her appearing in six films, three each year, two of which were uncredited, and the most notable being the two John Wayne films. Her first film in 1934 was The Devil Tiger.\n\nIn The Devil Tiger, Director Clyde E. Elliott allowed his hero, Kane Richmond, to fight a 25 foot python. Richmond hated doubles and had insisted. The actor, on his feet, on the ground, on his feet again, succeeded in holding the snake's snapping mouth away from his face, while struggling to free himself from the triple coils around his body. At the height of the struggle, the heroine, Marion Burns, runs in and saves the hero from the python. Miss Burns had to fight the snake too, in order to get at Richmond's pistol, with which she was supposed to shoot the python. She played her own scene, as well.\n\nIn the 1934 film Born to Be Bad Burns starred alongside Cary Grant and Loretta Young. In her last film of 1935 she starred opposite Lloyd Hughes in the crime drama Rip Roaring Riley. It would be her last film for a span of ten years. She married twice during her career. . Her first marriage was to actor Bruce MacFarlane which ended in divorce. Her second marriage was in 1934 to actor Kane Richmond, She returned to acting three times and only briefly following 1935.The first time was in a stage appearance in \"Leaning on Letty\" in January of 1936 at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles. The second time was in 1945 alongside her husband in Brenda Starr, Reporter, which starred Kane Richmond and Joan Woodbury. The third time wasn't until 1961 when she appeared on one episode of the television series My Three Sons. She eventually settled in Laguna Niguel, California, where she was living at the time of her death on December 22, 1993.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Marion Burns, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\n\nMovie Character Year\n3ebnrep7xj7euwddye0qjhwdq3v Paradise Canyon Linda Carter alias Princess Natasha 1935",

His presentation of the early country blues styles in a contemporary band setting is unique in Michigan. Although he has taken his blues singing, guitar playing, and harmonica playing to Washington, D.C. and on European tours, Eddie is the only pure blues musician to live and perform continuously in Michigan.\n\nEddie grew up in the small Mississippi Delta towns of Wells and Dublin, where he heard country blues recordings in his grandfather's juke joint and listened to his father play blues on harmonica, guitar, and piano. His greatest influences from country blues recordings came from Tommy McClennan, Memphis Minnie, and Big Bill Broonzy on guitar and from John Lee \"Sonny Boy\" Williamson on harmonica. The harmonica was Eddie's first instrument as a boy. Playing \"one string guitar\" on the side of the house led Eddie to playing the six-string guitar.\n\nAfter teaming up with blues guitarist John T. Smith in Davenport, Iowa, Eddie moved with John to Detroit in 1948. They played blues at house parties and eventually began to back up John Lee Hooker in performances and on recordings. When Hooker began touring nationally, he groomed Eddie to fill in for him at clubs and in recording sessions. Eddie moved toward the modern blues guitar style of T-Bone Walker by the early 1950s, and he adapted to the R&B sounds coming out of Motown and Staz labels. As blues gained a worldwide revival in the late 1960s, Eddie began touring European countries, playing blues throughout the 1970s.\n\nEddie's album Detroit on the U.S. label Blue Suit shows his deep roots and originality. The recording features country blues standards like \"Bottle Up and Go\" and \"Blue Jay (Fly Down South For Me)\" performed with fresh band arrangements. Eddie acknowledges the shared repertoire that is the mark of country blues: \"There ain't no notes that never been played before, you just rearrange them, in your own way.\" (1)\n\nHis maintenance of blues tradition while contributing new compositions and effects on the guitar and harmonica makes Eddie Burns a key bearer of the living blues tradition.\n\n(1) Burns, Eddie.
