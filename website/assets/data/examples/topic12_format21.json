Welcome to the Balanced Bites podcast, episode 39, I think. Adrenal Fatigue, Part 2. And apparently, my ghetto, you know, phone is not serving its purpose at this point, according to Diane. [laughs]\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:Yeah, we need to upgrade your phone situation for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that I\u2019m pretty sure the battery life of your phone is about, like 36 minutes. So\u2026.\n\nLIZ WOLFE:[laughs]\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:Like every time I\u2019m trying to talk to Liz, she\u2019s like, sorry, my phone\u2019s dead. I\u2019m like, so this is either Liz trying to avoid talking about anything with me or\u2026\n\nLIZ WOLFE:I\u2019m just like, I don\u2019t want to talk to you. That\u2019s all.\n\n\nLIZ WOLFE:Yeah, it\u2019s bad. My phone\u2019s like the old school phones that are shaped like candy bars, and they have those old ringers that are bwa-na-na-na- bwa-na-na-na. [laughs]\n\n\nLIZ WOLFE:I don\u2019t have text messages, so\u2026.kidding.\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:What\u2019s funny is that I remember when phones were really big. And then they got really small. Now they\u2019re kind of big again. I don\u2019t know\u2026\n\nLIZ WOLFE:I had a friend with the Zoolander phone, literally with the phone from Zoolander that was like the size of a Chiclet. [laughs] I\u2019ve got candy on the brain right now\u2026\n\n\nLIZ WOLFE:At the end of the Sugar Detox, this is really\u2026it broke the habit, but now I\u2019m thinking about it a little bit. Like I wonder if I\u2019m going to have any, you know, dark chocolate any time soon. I don\u2019t think I am. I think I\u2019m good for now.\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:[laughs] Well, that\u2019s good.\n\nLIZ WOLFE:I think the Detox broke the habit. Well, that\u2019s good. So, all right everybody, remember our disclaimer: that the materials and content of this podcast are intended as general information and are not to be considered as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.\n\nSo I might be a little bit fuzzy. I really don\u2019t know how to fix that, Diane. Let me mess around with this headphone. I\u2019m kidding. I have an iPhone.\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:Oh, that might be better.\n\nLIZ WOLFE:Is that better?\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:Yeah, I think that\u2019s a little better.\n\nLIZ WOLFE:All right.\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:Yeah, that is better.\n\nLIZ WOLFE:These are pretty crappy headphones. All right, so upcoming workshops. We are closing out our Spring\/Summer 2012 workshop season. We had an amazing run. Really grateful to PaleoKits and U.S. Wellness Meats for helping us bring this workshop all over the country for an extremely reasonable price. So if you\u2019re anywhere-well, we\u2019re booked up through Fall 2012 as well, so if you\u2019re anywhere in a several hour radius, come see us this weekend at CrossFit Amplitude in Winston-Salem, North Carolina or CrossFit Voltage in Charlotte. We love travelers, so if you do make the trip, be sure to let us know, so we can give you extra fist bumps and high fives. I mean, we know it\u2019s a challenge for a lot of people. But we\u2019d love to see you, and unfortunately, there\u2019s no guarantees that we\u2019ll be able to make it to yoru town if we\u2019re already scheduled in the general region. We try and be as logistics oriented in our travel as possible, such that we\u2019re not hopping back and forth and back and forth too much. We like to stick in one region and move on to the next, so look at that schedule and see if we\u2019re near you.\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:Yeah, I think we have mostly-what\u2019s coming up in the fall, we actually have a ton of East Coast workshops, so I think we\u2019re trying to see if there\u2019s a couple people we\u2019re talking to about some last scheduling, like one last weekend that we might get in on the West Coast this fall. But otherwise, we\u2019re mostly on the East Coast, so check out the schedule, and then definitely stay tuned for what will be coming up early 2013. I know it sounds like it\u2019s so far away, but we book these things really far in advance. Next year we\u2019ll definitely be getting back out that way to the West Coast, probably back to Texas, just kind of more in that direction. And probably not surprisingly, we\u2019ll probably not be in too many cold places this winter. [laughs] I made the mistake of going to the Midwest in March a couple years ago, and I was like, what\u2026what am I doing? [laughs]\n\nLIZ WOLFE:What were you thinking?\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:It was blistering cold. That was crazy, but anyway. We have to find out if our locations this weekend have air conditioning, just so we\u2019re aware\u2026\n\nLIZ WOLFE:Yeah, yeah. We have to plan our outfits such that\u2026we had\u2026when we were in West Houston, we give out these feedback forms. And, remember that feedback form we got that said, \u201cTell Liz not to wear a shirt that she has to yank and pull on all the time\u201d?\n\n\nLIZ WOLFE:Well, my shirt was melting off of my body, so I had to make sure that it didn\u2019t like [laugh]\u2026\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:[laugh] I know\u2026\n\nLIZ WOLFE:melt all the way off. You got to be careful. We have to pick outfits that we can sweat in with little\u2026that\u2019s why it\u2019s a fence to the general crowd.\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:I usually tell people right off the bat, yeah, I don\u2019t wear anti-perspirant so you\u2019re going to see sweat. Sorry.\n\nLIZ WOLFE:Yup, yup. Anywho, so what else?\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:I\u2019m trying to finish my book in the next week or so, so this podcast topic is near and dear to my heart right now on adrenal fatigue because I am like teetering on not wanting to just not wake up almost every day, but I have so much that I have to do. A lot of kind of back and forth work that we\u2019re getting done. I mean, I absoluitely understand how everyone who's asking these questions is feeling. There\u2019s a light at the end of this tunnel, but yeah, as far as like other places that I\u2019ll be this summer, other than sleeping in my bed, or sleeping somewhere on the beach, or possibly\u2026\n\nLIZ WOLFE:Sleeping somewhere in public?\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:Yeah, like down the Shore, I\u2019ll be at my Whole Foods buying some really good food, but yeah, mid-July, I will be at the CrossFit Games, as will you, right, Liz? Representing Steve\u2019s Club and PaleoKits will be there? And I\u2019ll just be hanging out trying to avoid the scorch on my face that happened this week at Northeast Regionals. Oh, I came home and was peeling and I had forgotten to bring that trusty zinc oxide Badger sunscreen with me, which I will not forget to bring to LA. So we\u2019ll both be out there mid-July. Definitely look for us. Again, definitely look for Liz at the PaleoKits booth, and I don\u2019t know, you can find me\u2026who knows? Maybe I\u2019ll try and wear a Bacon is Rad shirt or something. Those have sleeves. I\u2019m not really sure how that\u2019ll work in the LA sun. But then, er, it\u2019s actually Carlson, California. I just say LA.\n\nLIZ WOLFE:Oh, no, you have to be as naked as possible. I mean, it\u2019s the CrossFit Games.\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:Ugh. I\u2019m just thinking it\u2019s going to be some gnarly tan lines if you\u2019re not. Like, forget the rest of these issues, I have no idea about the shade issue. So that\u2019s mid-July. So like July 13th, 14th, 15th, I think. And then July 20th, not that probably tons of people who are listening to this will come to this event, but I\u2019m sure there are a handful. I\u2019ve actually gotten in contact with a few people. July 20th, that weekend there\u2019s a Juvenile Arthritis Foundation Conference. I think it\u2019s in New Orleans. And, so I\u2019ll be speaking there to some of the teenagers, maybe to their parents as well about nutrition, so that will be really cool. I\u2019m really excited about that. July 20th weekend. And then August 7th is the hard release date of my book, so I\u2019m really excited about that. I don\u2019t know. This home stretch is really just taking like every last bit of juice out of me. Like I\u2019m just\u2026Heh. I remember a couple of years ago, listening to Robb Wolf on his podcast talking about working on a book and teaching workshops and seminars, and you know, this last stretch of workshops we\u2019ve had, since, I would say, in May 5th, I actually planned on finishing the book by the end of March\u2026.\n\n\nDIANE SANFILIPPO:So I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be working on it right now. Yeah, yeah. The best laid plans\u2026that\u2019s why I don\u2019t really plan anything for myself. So to be like trying to finish the book and to be traveling a ton to teach? Like I love love love teaching the workshops, but it is taking everything out of me. So I\u2019ll be underground for awhile after this is done. I\u2019m not complaining I love every bit of it. I'm thrilled to be able to do all of this, but it's just been-it's been a real gasser for me, I would even say the last 6 months. So yeah, everyone whose questions I'm going to be answering today, I feel you. I absolutely feel you, so\u2026anything else you want to tell people before we roll into questions, 9 minutes in?\n\nLIZ WOLFE:I think we're good. We'll get right into it. All right, question number 1 from Margaret: \u201cHi Diane and Liz- This may be a lengthy question, but let me give you my background. I listened to your Podcast episode #15 about adrenal issues. Great information and it really helped me understand better... (truncated)",

        "text":"Charlie Deets\n\n\nHey man!\n\nI was just thinking about the time you asked me to take a walk with you because you were having a panic attack\n\nDo you still get them?\n\n\nalmost back to normal. like 95%\n\nit's been like a year and a half of brainwashing. but it's working.\n\n\"Back to normal\" meaning that there was a time when you didn't get them?\n\nthere was a time when I had them under control so they weren't interfering with my life in a destructive way.\n\nThat's what you mean by \"normal\"?\n\nyeah. I've always had bad anxiety since I was 17\n\nif I can function normally and not be depressed from them, I am quite content. I've learned to accept them. since trying to make them go away completely seems impossible from what I can tell.\n\nI have such a big problem with that word, \"normal\". It's what keeps me from seeing a therapist I think. I feel like they will impose an idea of \"normalcy\" that I may or may not agree with!\n\ntherapists hate the word normal.\n\nthey don't use it. in my experience.\n\nreplace normal with 'reasonable' above.\n\nBut they most have an opinion on what's right or wrong, right?\n\nThey steer you in a certain direction?\n\nthe type of therapy I've done is called cognitive behavioral therapy. you don't focus on the past or the future. you focus only on the way your thoughts affect your feelings.\n\nfor example. I tend to have catastrophic thoughts which end up making me feel very nervous. if I can catch those thoughts as I am having them, I can have thoughts about how those thoughts aren't helpful. those thoughts will help me feel comfortable and in control. where as if I don't address them, I will feel terrified instead.\n\ncbt aims to help you address the thoughts that are not helpful to you. nothing else. they don't say what's right or wrong.\n\nThat's awesome. Sounds like \"lucid feeling\" haha\n\nit's heavily related to 'mindfulness'. being here now. being aware of what's happening. except it comes from the vein of psychology instead of eastern philosophy.\n\nConversely, I've been thinking lately how little the \"now\" means when in contrast with time\n\nI've noticed it at work, too. We've both been at Facebook for a while and I now notice the same patterns repeat over and over again.\n\nAnd it prevents me from getting excited\n\nLike, nothing is exciting until it survives the passage of time\n\nyeah. it's cause you are holding onto the past. and thinking about the future. in the Tao Te Ching there is this one awesome passage: 55 -\n\nit basically says. if you get too stuck in your ways you get brittle. and everything hurts.\n\nThings like \"He never expects results; thus he is never disappointed\" seem so impractical to me.\n\nAnd I'm not sure it's healthier even if it was doable\n\nWe need disappointment to give meaning to the better moments, you know? I'm not sure we should try to suppress it by being what it seems like a \"passive participant\"\n\ni don't follow that in a literal way. i use to to show the opposite of how i normally think. it's more about retaining a balance by being aware of the alternative.\n\ni'm generally focused on the future. i am generally filled with desire.\n\ni am generally set in my ways.\n\nbut if i'm not aware of that, i am at risk of being not self-aware. and i think that leads to the worst situations.\n\nDo you remember how you anxiety started?\n\ni was 17 years old. i had gotten into a bad situation with some friends. we took three cars and drove side by side down the highway at 55mph. which the group think thought was 'legal'.\n\ni didn't want to do it. but i did it anyway. we got caught, and arrested. they said we were going to go to jail.\n\ni was basically a totally good kid before this, and i didn't have any ill will towards society, but all of a sudden i thought i was going to jail before i graduated high school.\n\nthe stress of the experience unlocked something in me. i'd be standing in the hallway at school and like, suddenly feel outside my body. i thought i was going crazy.\n\ni became obsessed with terrible thoughts. i couldn't think anything. i constantly felt like i was losing my mind or dying.\n\ni went to a doctor, and they decided i probably had panic disorder. they put me on an anti-depressant and xanax. i had never taken a drug before at all.\n\nthe drugs just seemed to make it all worse.\n\nWow -- I got arrested when I was 17 too.\n\nwhat did you get arrested for?\n\nIt's a way dorkier story. It was the weekend my brother and I got our first Mac laptop. That very same day Doom 3 came out and we were eager to test drive it in the new computer but had spent all our money saving up for it. So we decided to go to Walmart and take the game without paying.\n\nWe totally thought they wouldn't care. It was that naive.\n\nyeah, i mean it was doom 3. doom 1 would have been a totally different story.\n\nI remember going into the store and overtly ripping the plastic from the box and putting it on my jacket. They obviously noticed and stopped us right after we passed the cash register.\n\nBut yeah it was the same feeling, went from a totally normal kid to a FUCKING CRIMINAL in 30 seconds\n\nKinda crazy that I work for John Carmack now actually haha\n\nyou should go messenger pay him the price of the game plus interest. and say sorry.\n\nyeah. it makes me like... scared of society? i mean. being that one thing i did that was wrong was going to define me and my life.\n\ni didn't FEEL like a criminal. but suddenly i was.\n\nI totally get you though. I had long hair at the time and I remember the cops calling me a pothead when I was just a nerdy kid who never did drugs\n\noh i had a good one like that too\n\ni had written all over my hands at school one day with a bic pen\n\nand i got pulled over by a cop wanting to know 'where i was going'\n\nhe asked me what was written on my thumb\n\nand i told him it said 'thumb'\n\nbecause i had written thumb on my thumb\n\nhe made me get out of the car and gave me a sobriety test\n\nHaha omg I've never done a sobriety test but always wondered if they really ask you to spell the alphabet backwards because I can't do that sober\n\ni'm not sure. it didn't get that far. he realized i was just a young person finding myself instead of someone who was intoxicated. he tried to figure out 'what party i was going to.' i was like, i'm just going home. i was just at school.\n\nHaha amazing\n\nSo, how did you cope with your newfound anxiety?\n\ni didn't at first. it was pretty disturbing. i thought something was hella wrong with me. i tried the prescription drugs. but i eventually stopped taking them by 21 because i had become dependent on xanax and it wasn't helping my panic attack anymore. that's basically when i started CBT. after about two years or so, i had gotten away from having multiple panic attacks a day to having one everyone once and while\n\nSounds intense. Does that play a big role in what you've chosen to do (or not to do) since then?\n\ni never wanna take prescription drugs for my mental health again. and i will do anything i can to avoid that.\n\nI imagine that level of anxiety can be pretty paralizing, yet you chose to get t on a stage and perform music in front of people in spite of that. How come?\n\nsome things i do are partially to gain experience overcoming anxiety. but as far as music, i just like it. i like the music i make and i want to share it with people.\n\nHas anxiety ever stopped you from doing something you like?\n\nbeing comfortable in meetings...\n\ni've gone through periods of agoraphobia when it's gotten really bad.\n\nduring those times, i literally don't want to leave my house. because i'm scared of people and everything. but...when that happens i know something is way wrong, so i just start thinking about what thoughts i'm having.\n\nbut yeah, it makes me shyer than i'd like in certain situations. more tentative.\n\nYou watched Alex Cornell's talk from valiocon right?\n\nSo interesting that we all go through different levels of anxiety\n\nI wonder if theres something in this industry that attracts that kind of people -- or maybe it's just creative people\n\nyeah, alex's talk was awesome.\n\ni think most everyone faces anxiety. and something like 10% of people have an anxiety disorder.'s pretty common.\n\nAnd yet it's so hard to be transparent about that\n\nwhy? it's not that hard. i think it's a lot easier now than it's ever been. people might judge me as weak or something. but i'm not. they'll figure it out.\n\nYou mean for you or in general?\n\nI think for me. it's pretty easy to talk about my anxiety. I get relief from it. I don't think people should feel they can't talk about it. I want to believe society is beyond stigmatizing mental health issues.\n\nMe too\n\nRead by 4,332 others\n\nCharlie Deets\n\n\nCharlie is the Lead Product Designer on Groups at Facebook.

        "text":"Our Blog\n\nA Model for Successful Engagement and Support through Virtual Connections\n\nBy Joanne Lee on June 23rd, 2021\n\nVirtual platforms have become a lifeline for many during the COVID-19 pandemic to disseminate timely information and resources, and stay connected with partners. Since 2012, County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) has been a national leader in utilizing virtual connections to support community leaders and practitioners across the country. Their monthly webinars remain one of the organization\u2019s highest profile services. The webinars feature respected leaders discussing a variety of community health improvement topics and reach community practitioners nationwide. Each webinar is followed by a virtual discussion group which is facilitated by Healthy Places by Design. The discussion groups promote cross-community sharing about the topic and encourage practitioners to think about how they may apply strategies presented in the webinars in their communities. Ericka Burroughs-Girardi is a Senior Outreach Specialist and lead producer for the CHR&R webinars. She shares her perspectives about virtual platforms and connections, and their value in supporting communities striving to achieve health and racial equity.\n\n\nJL: How did the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) webinars begin, and how have they evolved over the past eight years?\n\nEBG: Webinars are a regular part of CHR&R\u2019s suite of outreach to communities. We consider webinars a tool to reinforce the message that there are many factors that influence how long and how well people live. The content is designed to help audience members take steps to improve the health of their community. Early webinars focused on introducing the public to the Rankings Model and steps to improve health in CHR&R\u2019s Action Center. They featured more downstream, or programmatic, solutions to health challenges.\n\nOver time and as the community health improvement field evolved, we recognized a need to shift to more upstream, or policy-focused, solutions. In 2017, we began to intentionally incorporate health equity into the webinars, with a specific focus on helping community practitioners translate it into action. We also added special topic series to support communities in their efforts to address timely issues as they emerged. We began co-producing webinars with other national organizations, such as NeighborWorks America and UnidosUS, to increase their reach and impact. Over the years, we have discovered what I like to call the \u201csecret sauce\u201d of our webinars \u2013 the key ingredients being teamwork, relatability, and follow-up support. To host a successful webinar, it takes a team of people, both on camera and behind-the-scenes, with clear roles.\u00a0 Our webinar production team includes a lead producer, an assistant producer, an audience engagement (chat) manager, a Q&A manager, and a technologist. Additionally, we\u2019ve adopted a tone resembling that of a podcast so audiences feel like they are part of an intimate conversation with webinar presenters. We encourage the audience to engage with us, using chat prompts and live polling. Since our objective is to help community practitioners learn about and apply community health improvement strategies, we follow up with the audience. They receive a customized resource guide that includes links to tools and strategies.\n\n\nOur organizations (CHR&R and Healthy Places by Design) have an eight-year partnership, and it has been mutually beneficial for Healthy Places by Design to lead the planning and facilitation of the discussion groups that follow each CHR&R webinar. Describe the discussion groups and how they fit into the strategy to support communities.\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more that our partnership has been mutually beneficial! Our organizations share the same vision to advance community-led action and proven, place-based strategies to ensure health and wellbeing for all, and our capacities are complementary.\n\nAs the CHR&R webinar content became more equity-centered, audience questions revealed their need to \u201cunpack\u201d the content. We knew we had to offer a deeper learning experience than a 60- minute webinar if we wanted participants to feel confident taking steps to create equitable health solutions. Through our partnership with Healthy Places by Design, we launched the post-webinar discussion groups in 2017.\u00a0 Feedback from participants showed them to be successful in helping attendees process what they heard and talk with others about challenging and complex issues. We have seen how the smaller virtual meeting format enables discussion group participants to be more actively and intimately engaged, sharing local solutions and presenting challenges to resolve with peers. Healthy Places by Design\u2019s expert facilitation of these groups creates a safe learning environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their vulnerabilities. This often bolsters learning. There is authenticity, laughter, and even tears shed when the dialogue gets real and raw. It\u2019s been rewarding to see discussion group participants self-organize by sharing contact information and tools they have developed. The discussion groups have emerged as a key ingredient in the success of CHR&R\u2019s community outreach and support.\n\n\"...because growth never happens in a space of comfort. Expect the CHR&R webinars and discussion groups to challenge status quo thinking and solutions.\"\n\n\nAs you reflect on the evolution of the CHR&R webinars, what are you most proud of?\n\nPersonally, I am most proud of the Health Equity and Social Solidarity in the Time of the Pandemic: Strategies for COVID-19 Response and Recovery webinar series (May-August 2020). It focused on inequities magnified by the pandemic and highlighted equitable recovery strategies. While it featured veteran equity champions, such as Dr. Camara Jones, it primarily highlighted unsung heroes deeply committed to equity. And this year, the Declaring Racism as a Public Health Crisis webinar (May 2021) drew 1,000 participants for the first time in the program\u2019s history! That confirmed we are responding to our audience\u2019s learning needs. I credit the increase in attendance to our organization\u2019s willingness to be courageous in addressing topics that are timely and aligned with the root causes of health inequities, such as structural racism.\n\nThe webinars are one of our best outreach tools in our efforts to support communities. I am excited that average webinar attendance has grown from 150 participants in 2014 to over 500 in 2020. And discussion group attendance has grown, too, cresting over 100 in recent months!\n\n\nAnd what key lessons have you learned as the webinars and discussion groups have grown over time?\n\nI have learned that communities are incredibly resilient. Creating equitable communities is a collective effort, one that requires all of us to be committed to its achievement. We must support each other by sharing of resources, tools, and even words of encouragement. We must be inclusive and share power with those who are most impacted by health inequities. These values have weaved their way into the CHR&R webinar production process. We recognize that communities own their stories. We are simply sharing our national platform for their experiences to be heard. In this way, we are choosing inclusivity and to share our power.\n\n\nWhat can we look forward to as you build upon the past successes of the CHR&R webinars and discussion groups?\n\nI am excited to say that you can look forward to more CHR&R webinars and discussion groups! We\u2019ve seen that communities are ready to engage in upstream solutions, so you can expect our webinars to dig even deeper into roots of health inequities. The content may feel uncomfortable at times. When it does, I hope the audience will have faith that it is a sign of growth because growth never happens in a space of comfort. Expect the CHR&R webinars and discussion groups to challenge status quo thinking and solutions. We want community leaders, residents, practitioners, and decision makers to leave our webinars and discussion groups feeling equipped to create equitable solutions.\n\nJoanne Lee\n\nCollaborative Learning Director\n\nAdventurous strategist, cross-cultural explorer, and human and animal welfare champion.",

        "text":"Blog & Resources\n\nRecognizing the Signs of Fibromyalgia\n\nPosted by:\n\nBy Larisa Goldin, MBA, LMP\n\nAn interview with Margaret Mulroney, RN\n\n\nFibromyalgia Syndrome, or FMS, is a condition that involves significant pain in the muscles and joints of the body.\u00a0People suffering from fibromyalgia often seek out massage therapy as a means of temporary relief from pain.\u00a0 Dreamclinic sat down for an interview with client Margaret Mulroney, a registered nurse and advocate for greater understanding and information about FMS.\n\n\nFibromyalgia Points\n\nDC: You hear the term fibromyalgia a lot lately. \u00a0For those not familiar, what is this condition?\n\n\nFibromyalgia is a syndrome rather than a disease, because the doctors don\u2019t know the cause of it yet. \u00a0It is a disorder of the central nervous system where there is perceived pain without any obvious thing causing the pain: no visible signs or inflammation. \u00a0The pain involves the ligaments, tendons and muscles of the body. \u00a0The most common symptoms are fatigue and muscle pain all over the body. \u00a0Other conditions often go along with it, such as irritable bowel syndrome and numerous hormonal imbalances, adrenal gland or thyroid being the most common.\u00a0Another common condition that goes along with fibromyalgia is an underlying sleep disorder.\u00a0FMS is diagnosed by a rheumatologist who will check along 18 common tender points and will also rule out other conditions that mimic FMS, such as hepatitis or thyroid condition.\n\nDC: One of the things you hear about Fibromyalgia is it often goes undiagnosed for years.\u00a0Why is it so hard to diagnose?\n\n\nThe onset can be very slow. \u00a0It can take years for the symptoms to become so clear-cut that they can be properly diagnosed. \u00a0Sometimes fibromyalgia develops as a post-traumatic condition: if a person has a car accident and a lot of pain that never full goes away. \u00a0Then, because the symptoms can be vague, health professionals will attribute them to other causes: viruses, menopause in women or anxiety.\u00a0Often, doctors downplay the condition: they can\u2019t find an organic or physiological cause for the pain or fatigue and so they focus on the patient\u2019s psychological outlook and they decide the causes of the illness are psychosomatic. \u00a0In my case, I had depression for many years, so the fibromyalgia symptoms were ignored. \u00a0I was treated as a person with depression rather than a person with a physical condition.\n\nDC: In your case, what symptoms were you experiencing and how did you discover you had fibromyalgia?\n\n\nI\u2019ve had insomnia since high school and also 20 years of muscle pain. \u00a0My first job was in nursing, and after 10 years I had to quit because nursing is very physical and I had a lot of pain in my neck and shoulders. \u00a0Chiropractics helped partially, but I always felt something was wrong with my neck. \u00a0The pain was never fully gone. \u00a0Then, after 10 years of seeing a chiropractor, I developed low back pain. \u00a0I went to see a physical therapist and, instead of improving, I began to experience neuralgia (a pins and needles sensation in the hands and feet).\u00a0An MRI ruled out multiple sclerosis so my next stop was to see a neurologist. \u00a0The neurologist said my symptoms were caused by anxiety. \u00a0Then I saw another chiropractor. \u00a0But, in all these years of seeing different health professionals, there was no answer to why I always had pain.\n\nFour years ago, I started seeing a massage therapist for the low back pain and there were spots on my body so tender they could not be touched. \u00a0So the massage therapist told me about her mom who had been diagnosed with FMS and the symptoms were very similar to mine. \u00a0So I went to my primary doctor and said I think I have fibromyalgia and he sent me to a rheumatologist. \u00a0As it turns out, I had 17 out 18 tender points that are used to diagnose fibromyalgia.\n\nDC: You have had a number of related conditions. \u00a0How are they linked to fibromyalgia?\n\n\nAll we know is that fibromyalgia is a disorder of the central nervous system but not the root cause. \u00a0Whatever is responsible for fibromyalgia could be causing other multiple disorders. \u00a0A lot of people with fibromyalgia have multiple autoimmune conditions.\u00a0They have low thyroid, lupus or chronic fatigue syndrome. \u00a0Also, ninety percent of those diagnosed with fibromyalgia are women who are pre- or post-menopausal. \u00a0After many years of trying to deal with the pain and fatigue, isn\u2019t it normal our bodies are going to show the signs of all this stress?\n\nDC: Based on your personal journey with fibromyalgia, what would you recommend if someone suspects they have this condition?\n\n\nListen to what your body is telling you rather than what the doctor is telling you. \u00a0If I had paid better attention to what my body was telling me, I would have quit my nursing graveyard shift much earlier. \u00a0The fact that I didn\u2019t really took a toll on my body.\u00a0To be a better advocate for yourself start keeping a journal and get specific.\u00a0When you talk to a doctor, try to keep your emotions out of the explanation so the doctor is less likely to write off your concerns as psychosomatic. Doctors don\u2019t like self-diagnosis, but if you think you have Fibromyalgia, speak up and ask to see a rheumatologist.\u00a0 Don\u2019t let the system intimidate you.\n\nThere are some good resources I should also mention:\n\n  1. A good website in Seattle is\u00a0\n  2. There is also the Fibromyalgia Personal Support Center at\u00a0through which you can locate a number of support groups\n  3. The Arthritis Foundation at has some good information about Fibromyalgia\n  4. Pacific Rheumatological associates are doing some interesting research with FMS.\u00a0 Their website is\n\u00a0 Related Blogs\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.",

        "text":"Mar 25, 2019\n\nNursing Journeys: Assess, Diagnose, Plan: She Followed the Nursing Process to Succeed\n\nLaura Reichhardt, MS, APRN, NP-C at the U.S. Mexico border\n\nLaura Reichhardt at the 2006 D\u00eda del Campesino health fair in San Luis, Arizona. Reichhardt started her career in community health, focused on U.S.-Mexico border health. Here, she hands out lead screening tools and bandanas, which are used by migrant farmworkers for protection from sun and the elements.\n\nNursing Journeys is a profile series featuring Action Coalition leaders discussing their career paths and reflecting on the lessons they\u2019ve learned.\n\nLaura Reichhardt, MS, APRN, NP-C, is the director of the Hawaii State Center for Nursing and an adult-geriatric nurse practitioner.\n\nHer answers to the questions below show her path from being a public health and health care administration professional to her work today advocating for nurses through national, state, and local initiatives and partnerships with schools of nursing, nursing employers, interprofessional health care partners, and policymakers across the state.\u00a0\n\nWhy did you decide to become a nurse?\n\nI started my career in public health, focusing on U.S.-Mexico border health, and then moved to health care administration and quality metrics for a large health care insurance company. After developing large population health interventions, I realized I would find it more fulfilling to become a clinician. I felt nursing was closest to my personal values and the values I acquired as a public health professional. I applied to a master\u2019s entry program in nursing with an emphasis in an adult-gerontology nurse practitioner curriculum.\n\nDescribe the journey you took to get from that decision to where you are today.\n\nHawaii Senator Mazie Hirono, fellow University of Hawaii School of Nursing students Gregory Gee and Elizabeth Alonzo, Laura Reichhardt, and Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz in Washington DC in 2014 after the AACN Student Policy Summit Institute.\n\nWhen I applied to nursing school, we were in the largest economic recession in decades. In my community, the hospital-based jobs available to new graduate nurses were sparse. Through a nursing policy fellowship, I had a unique opportunity to work with the dean of University of Hawai\u2018i at Manoa School of Nursing, and the Hawai\u2018i State Center for Nursing. And they secured a policy internship for state Sen. Rosalyn Baker, who at the time was the chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and the vice chair of the Senate Committee on Health.\n\nThese opportunities, coupled with my public health background and my new nursing knowledge, positioned me to have a new population focus for my work: nurses! It is rewarding working for nurses and ensuring they are considered in policy and workforce planning efforts.\n\nWhat impact did the Institute of Medicine\u2019s\u00a0Future of Nursing\u00a0report have on you?\n\nThis report, published the year before I began nursing school, was a guiding principle to the work we were endeavoring to do. Today, I consider it a foundational piece of my work. It is a tool I use as validation for our local work and the priorities our stakeholders identify. It remains relevant and it serves as a benchmark for the progress we have made in our state and in the nation.\n\nHow have you been involved with the\u00a0Campaign for Action?\nReichhardt in 2017, two years into her tenure as director of the Hawai\u2018i State Center for Nursing.\n\nReichhardt in 2017, two years into her tenure as director of the Hawai\u2018i State Center for Nursing.\n\nAs director of the Hawai\u2018i State Center for Nursing, I have the pleasure of being a co-lead and the administrative organizer for Hawai\u2018i Action Coalition activities. Our state received an Academic Progression in Nursing grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which provided us resources to increase our BSN percentage considerably. We also engage in efforts to remove barriers to advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) practice, secure nursing student intern positions in our state legislature, support and engage in interprofessional education efforts, expand access to health care with school-based health initiatives, and have a robust nursing workforce research and statewide nurse residency collaborative within the Center. The work done at the Center for Nursing represents the Campaign\u2019s goals, and also has broadened to include Culture of Health initiatives.\n\nOf all you have accomplished, what are you most proud of?\n\nIn 2017, a meeting that I organized of health profession deans led to legislative support to increase the number of health care preceptors\u2014work that has also opened our eyes to the needs of preceptors and their critical role in health care education.\n\nAt the meeting, we were able to demonstrate through data a true crisis in access to preceptors and the impact it had on the ability to admit students into health care programs. The following legislative session, this group asked the state legislature for help. What resulted was an interprofessional health care professional preceptor tax credit.\n\nStarting in 2019, APRNs, physicians, and pharmacists licensed in Hawai\u2018i who precept in-state APRN, medical, or pharmacy students can receive up to $5,000 in state income tax credit.\n\nWhat is the most important action that nurses can take to lead the way to improve health and health care in America?\n\nCommit to action and follow the nursing process, which is assessment, diagnosis, outcomes\/planning, implementation, and evaluation.\n\nNurses are the largest population of health care professionals. From leading unit-based quality improvement initiatives to neighborhood voting registration campaigns, to systems improvement efforts, we are well prepared for leading change. Further, our preparation to follow the nursing process can be applied everywhere: from patient management to policy.\n\nWhat advice do you have for the next generation?\n\nI\u2019m a millennial, so I think my generation is still often considered \u201cthe next generation.\u201d My generation, and the one that is only now in nursing school, is quick to identify systemic calcifications\u2026 workflows and processes that perhaps once worked but today are stiff and need some intervention. My advice is to identify practical, feasible solutions where improvements are warranted. I also would advise that we take to heart the #KonMari method and apply it to nursing. We need to simplify our process and used evidence-based practice to create the opportunities for advancements in care.\n\nMy greatest hope is that we apply our \u201cmillennial brains\u201d that are primed for multitasking, technology, and collaborative work to achieve health equity, improved health care quality, and innovation so that one day our society\u2019s needs are no longer outpacing our capacity to provide needed care.",

        "text":"60-Second Health\n\nHow Yoga Might Relieve Stress-Linked Ailments\n\nYoga may increase parasympathetic nervous system activity and neurotransmitter levels, helping to decrease symptoms of some stress-related illnesses. Katherine Harmon reports\n\nYoga and relaxation practices have been around for thousands of years. And modern research suggests that yoga could have a very real impact on many stress-related illnesses, including anxiety, depression and heart disease.\n\nAnd here's another reason to be down with downward-facing dog. Stress can make symptoms of chronic pain and depression worse. But yoga might be able to help, in part by stimulating the cranial nerve and an important neurotransmitter called GABA. The new theory is in the journal Medical Hypotheses. [C. C. Streeter et al., \"Effects of yoga on the autonomic nervous system, gamma-aminobutyric-acid, and allostasis in epilepsy, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder\"]\n\nPrevious research had found that people who did yoga for 12 weeks had lower anxiety and reduced chronic pain than those who went for walks or had standard medical care alone. The yoga-ers also had higher levels of GABA.\n\nThe researchers are now testing just how well yoga, combined with conventional treatments, can actually improve symptoms of real medical and psychological conditions, including epilepsy, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. And that might generate news you can take sitting down. Preferably in a lotus pose.\n\n\u2014Katherine Harmon\n\n[The above text is a transcript of this podcast.]\n\nShare this Article:\n\n\nYou must sign in or register as a member to submit a comment.\nScientific American Dinosaurs\n\nGet Total Access to our Digital Anthology\n\n1,200 Articles\n\nOrder Now - Just $39! >\n\n\nEmail this Article",

She says Ellie has an eating disorder, is suicidal, cuts herself and has overdosed on prescription drugs. She also says Ellie lashes out at her in anger on a daily basis, forcing her husband, Rob, to play referee between them. What\u2019s at the root of the teen\u2019s behavior? Ellie admits she has low self-esteem but says her mom is overreacting. How does she explain her choices? Dr. Phil digs deep into the teen\u2019s past to find the source of her pain. Can she turn her life around, before it\u2019s too late?\n\nMore than 16 million kids in the United States are at risk for hunger each day. Fortunately, you can help.

She overdosed on Lortab, Xanax, Lunesta and most recently, she tested positive for Oxycontin. I am so fearful of another overdose or possibly even suicide.\"\n\nKelly says her daughter, Ellie, also cuts herself to numb her pain. \"She recently got mad at me and brought the knife out of her room and said, \u2018Look what you made me do.\u2019 She has zero impulse control,\" Kelly says. \"My daughter has created total chaos. It\u2019s such hostile anger.\"\n\nRob, Kelly's husband and Ellie's stepdad, says he has become a referee for their fights.\u00a0\n\nAnother concern Kelly says she has is that Ellie has gained 50 pounds during the last year. \"My daughter\u2019s weight is an extremely sensitive subject with her,\" she says. \"She has been emotionally eating. She binges on junk food.\"\n\nDuring a video that Kelly recorded, Ellie can be heard saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never been this fat. I just want to die!\u201d\n\nKelly fears for her daughter's life. \"I\u2019m losing my daughter. I feel like she\u2019s slipping away. She\u2019s broken, and I can\u2019t fix her,\u201c she says, fighting back tears.\n\nKelly and Rob join Dr. Phil onstage. \u201cThere\u2019s so much danger involved in this situation,\u201d Dr. Phil says to them. \u201cAre you concerned for your daughter\u2019s life or just her emotional development?\u201d\n\nKelly says both. \u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned she could be suicidal,\u201d she says. \u201cShe is willing to do anything she can to numb the pain, and she cares about nothing in her life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a girl here who\u2019s being very self-destructive,\u201d Dr. Phil says. \u201cWhat is it that\u2019s driving all of this?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been in counseling since almost 2. We went through a horrible divorce with her father when she was 2,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cShe goes berserk \u2014 zero to 100 in 20 seconds. And then she will turn into, \u2018I\u2019m charming. I have this halo around me,\u2019 and master manipulator.\u201d\n\nEllie's Side\n\n\"I don\u2019t have a really great relationship with my mom. I lie about stuff. I usually blame most of the fighting on her,\" Ellie shares. \"I do, sometimes, say I hate her, because I know that that will cut deepest. I\u2019ve called her a bitch and said, 'Go to hell.' I\u2019m just trying to hurt her in the moment, because I feel like she\u2019s hurt me.\"\n\nEllie admits that after she broke up with her boyfriend a year ago, she was very upset and took numerous medications, causing her to overdose. \"It was not a cry for help. I just, in my own words, wanted to, \u2018Get out of things.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to face reality,\" she says. She denies taking Oxycontin and having a drug problem. \"They definitely have no reason to be concerned about my drug use,\" she says. \"I have not taken Xanax. My mother said that I took those things, and she is lying.\"\n\nThe teen reveals that she has cut herself. \"I feel the physical pain, and so I forget about the emotional pain, but afterward, you feel both. It\u2019s really stupid,\" she says.\n\nEllie joins her parents onstage. She tells Dr. Phil that last year, she went down the wrong path, hung out with a questionable crowd and didn\u2019t have the best grades, but she says she\u2019s changed.\n\nEllie opens up to Dr. Phil about what's driving her behavior.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s not working for you in your life?\u201d Dr. Phil asks.\n\n\u201cMy relationship with my mom is not working in my life,\u201d Ellie says, fighting back tears. \u201cMy relationship with my father is not working, because he\u2019s not healthy for me. He just doesn\u2019t help me. And, my relationship with others, because I can\u2019t put myself out there because of fear of rejection from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat gets overwhelming for you at times, and so you look for a way to escape that,\u201d Dr. Phil says.\n\n\u201cI want to know what it takes for you to not just be at peace, but to be happy.\u201d\n\nDr. Phil asks Kelly, \u201cWhat\u2019s your reaction to what you\u2019re hearing her say right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s leaving quite a bit out concerning her real emotional pain,\u201d she says.\n\nEllie and Kelly argue about the events that occurred before they came onstage.\n\n\u201cShe was basically trying to control what I was going to say out here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the problem here; This is a family problem,\u201d Dr. Phil tells Ellie. And, Dr. Frank Lawlis, Chairman of the Dr. Phil Advisory Board and author of Not My Child: A Progressive and Proactive Approach For Healing Addicted Teenagers and Their Families, weighs in.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to give her what she needs,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cI can do this. I can do that, but it\u2019s not good enough \u2026 There\u2019s no winning. I\u2019ve tried everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing you do exactly the same thing here as you were doing on tape,\u201d Dr. Phil tells Kelly.\n\nDr. Phil turns to Ellie and offers her advice.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let what somebody else does determine how you feel about who you are.\u201d\n\nHelp for Ellie\n\n\u201cThis girl\u2019s life is in danger,\u201d Dr. Phil tells Kelly and Rob. \u201cShe is very, very lonely. And, she truly believes that there\u2019s a better place than where she is now, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s used escape mechanisms, like drugs, and that\u2019s why suicide would make sense to her.\u201d\n\nDr. Phil continues, addressing Kelly. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost connection with your daughter,\u201d he tells her. \u201cWhen she started the screaming, yelling, bullying, out-of-control impulse erratic, you [threw your hands up], because you don\u2019t know how to deal with that, and you come across to her as uncaring and very cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very overwhelmed, and I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Kelly says, fighting back tears.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re disconnected from this girl, and she\u2019s feeling lonely,\u201d Dr. Phil tells her. \u201cShe lost her dad. Now, she\u2019s feeling she\u2019s alienated her mother, because you\u2019re so cold and judgmental, in her eyes.\u201d\n\nDr. Phil introduces Dr. Matthew Polacheck, program director at the Center for Discovery, a structured, therapeutic residential treatment center that works with troubled, out-of-control teens and their families. He tells Kelly and Rob that the Center is willing to work with Ellie. They agree that Ellie needs to go.\n\n\u201cUntil she values herself, she won\u2019t stop putting herself at risk,\u201d Dr. Phil says.\u00a0\n\nAfter the Taping\n\nAfter the show, Kelly and Rob tell Ellie that they've decided to send her to the Center for Discovery \u2014 but will they stick with their decision?\n\n\"I am going to hate you forever if you make me go.\"",
