        "text":"Apple assesment over the past decade\n\nWalt Mossberg, the renowned and highly respected technology columnist for the Wall St. Journal and The Verge, briefly came out of retirement to write an insightful analysis of the past decade of Apple with Tim Cook at the helm. It was a fascinating take \u2013 well balanced, knowledgeable, and perceptive, especially considering how supportive his views have been about Apple under Steve Jobs. It\u2019s well worth reading here\u00a0on The Verge.\n\nApple has always been of interest to those that love tech hardware such as myself, because it\u2019s been the world leader and has raised the level of hardware design and innovation for appearance, quality and ease of use. Apple\u2019s products in the late 90s set the standard for mechanical fit and finish that was picked up by its competitors and significantly raised the standards of the public\u2019s expectations.\n\nBut with Jobs departure due to his illness and death, things have not gone so well and, In that context I want to add to Mossberg\u2019s analysis and expand on several points he wrote relating to Cook\u2019s impact on Apple\u2019s products:\n\nBut Cook does bear the responsibility for a series of actions that screwed up the Macintosh for years. The beloved mainstream MacBook Air was ignored for five years. At the other end of the scale, the Mac Pro, the mainstay of professional audio, graphics, and video producers, was first neglected then reissued in 2013 in a way that put form so far ahead of function that it enraged its customer base.\n\nSome insiders think Cook allowed Ive\u2019s design team far too much power and that the balance Jobs was able to strike between the designers and the engineers was gone, at least until Ive left the company earlier this year.\n\nThe design-first culture that took root under Cook struck again with the MacBook Pro, yielding new laptops so thin their keyboards were awful and featuring USB-C ports that required sleek Macs to be used with ugly dongles. Apple has only recently retreated back to decent keyboards on the latest MacBook Pro, and it issued a much more promising Mac Pro. But dongles are still a part of the Apple experience across its product lines.\n\nOver the past decade I\u2019ve observed much the same, and have written about it here and on other sites. As someone that\u2019s developed and reviewed products professionally for many decades, I\u2019ve cringed to see so many unforced errors. Finding and criticizing was not fun, but Apple brought it on by the expectations they set, amplified by often over-the-top PR. It was the company that led the way in creating some of the best tech products in the world that so many loved. So when they faltered some were eager to criticize, while others, as myself, wanted to point out their mistakes in the hope of fixing them.\n\nOnce Cook took over, Apple made mistakes relating to its products frequent enough to wonder what was going on and what were they thinking. Some of the reasons have become more apparent in recent months as inside information leaked out.\n\nThe first product CEO Cook personally announced, Apple Maps, turned out to be a total embarrassment. \u00a0After personally praising the product as he personally introduced it, it immediately became apparent that Cook had never used the product, because most of us experienced embarrassing navigation issues. I remember how it directed me in the wrong direction to a restaurant in San Francisco, miles away from the correct location, Heads rolled as a result and Cook had to apologize.\n\nWe then saw a succession of bad hardware decisions over the years.\n\n  \u2022 Removing useful ports from computer notebooks and phones and replacing them with dozens of optional dongles. While Apple said this was necessary because of size constraints, most of the Windows notebooks managed to be as thin and light as the new MacBooks, while retaining all of the ports.\n  \u2022 Using smaller batteries than competitors use in their iPhones, making it difficult to get through the day and causing sudden shutdowns to the phone as the batteries aged. While most wanted longer battery life, Apple opted for thinness.\n  \u2022 Bendgate, the situation where many iPhones began bending in the pocket because the product was so thin.\n  \u2022 Replacing the well-sproven, reliable keyboard with the unreliable butterfly version to make the MacBooks a bit thinner. That led to five years of recalls and repairs and notebooks without a dependable keyboard.\n  \u2022 Designing Apple MacBooks so they were impossible to repair or replace defective parts. The subassemblies were all glued together and the products became throwaways. iFixit\u2019s repair ratings for MacBooks plummeted to a 1 out of 10, where 10 was easily repairable.\n\nThese were all decisions that were made for aesthetics and not for function. It was what became known Apple\u2019s obsession with thinness.\n\nAs Walt noted, Jony Ive, the head of design, who worked closely with Jobs, was now untethered. He became Apple\u2019s new product visionary and he ran wild. Cook ceded product responsibility to Ive.\n\nThe results would have been catastrophic for most companies, but Apple had so much goodwill and its products were generally so much better than competitors, that Ive\u2019s impact was less visible for a long time, aided by Apple\u2019s PR machine lauding every new design tweak, from the \u201cspecial aluminium\u201d to the \u201camazing new crown\u201d on the watch .\n\nNow, a decade later after this transition, the evidence is clear. Apple has squandered their advantage and has created products that have greatly diminished its leadership in the notebook arena and has saddled its iPhone users with a myriad of problems because of an obsession with thinness.\n\nWith Ive just recently departing, we\u2019ve seen the first MacBook in five years with a reliable keyboard, the MacBook 16\u2033. Fans are hoping it\u2019s the harbinger of a wave of new notebooks that will solve the keyboard issue on all models.\n\nWhat I remember about the last decade is that Apple entered it with the most innovative, beautiful, and well-designed products ever, and is leaving the decade with line of unreliable notebooks and underpowered phones, both just now being addressed.\n\nIn other areas Apple has had better success. It tool Apple three years to fix a lot of Watch problems, but now that it\u2019s in its 3rd incarnation, its an excellent product with no serious competition. \u00a0Apple has also had a big success with its Earpods accessory headphones.\n\nThe next big announcement for Apple is this Spring and many are hoping for a new line of notebooks with keyboards that finally work.\n\n\n\n\n\nby Phil Baker",

        "text":"No company in the computer industry generates more intense emotion on the part of its customers than Apple Computer, which celebrates 30 years in business tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Elsewhere on the site we have a recap of PC Magazine's coverage of Apple\u00a0\u00a0and I've done a lot of writing about the history of the PC industry that covers Apple and the other early players, so instead I thought I'd write a bit about my use of Apple products over the years.\n\nApple was founded on April 1, 1976 but the company didn't make too much of a splash until the West Coast Computer Faire in April 1977, when the Apple II was unveiled.\u00a0 I wish I could say I was there, but I wasn't.\u00a0 I was living on the East coast Evolvingmacsat the time. In fact, when it came time to buy my first personal computer, I admit it:\u00a0 I chose the Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 1 over the Apple II, largely because I knew I could get it serviced.\n\nIn retrospect, of course, the Apple II had a number of key benefits.\u00a0\u00a0 One was hardware - notably the first mass-market floppy disk drive, which Steve Wozniak legendarily designed, and which entered the market in 1978.\u00a0 Another was software, specifically Visicalc, created by Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston.\u00a0 And the third was passion:\u00a0 not only the passion of Jobs and Wozniak and the folks who worked for Apple, but also their recognition and encouragement of the passion of Apple customers, who went off to evangelize the system.\n\nIn the early 1980's, I moved out to the West Coast to work for Popular Computing, and I did spend a lot of time with later Apple IIs, notably the IIe (probably the most successful model of the line) and the IIc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And of course, there was the Lisa, which came out in 1982.\u00a0 It was an absolutely gorgeous machine that had two main problems:\u00a0 almost no third-party software and a price tag near $10,000.\u00a0\n\nStill, it led to Apple's big success: the Macintosh.\u00a0 I can still remember Steve Jobs ushering me into a room where he showed me the first Mac, which was still not quite final.\u00a0 And I remember taking it home and spending days just using it, just because it was so different from anything that came before it.\u00a0\u00a0 (Yes, the Lisa had a lot of the same UI, but it was designed as a corporate machine - the Mac was a machine for all of us.)\n\nThat original Mac looks painful to use in retrospect.\u00a0 It had 128K of memory and a single drive, so often you'd find yourself inserting one disk, taking it out and putting in another, over and over again.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But those early applications set the look of applications pretty much to this day.\u00a0\u00a0 If you ever used Word 1.0 for the Mac, you'd be pretty much at home in today's versions of Microsoft Word.\n\nI remember the 128K Mac fondly, as well as the later 512K version and of course the external floppy drive and later a 5MB hard disk that I shared with 3 Macs.\u00a0\u00a0 Later came machines with internal hard disks.\n\n\u00a0But perhaps the Mac I remember most fondly was the Macintosh II, which came out in 1987.\u00a0 It supported external color monitors, and I remember using it with a dual display back when that was really unusual.\u00a0\n\nAnd it was on a Mac II that I really started using some of the applications that defined computing for me for a long time:\u00a0 Pagemaker, Powerpoint, Filemaker, and More.\n\nApple continued to improve Macs, and the first Mac Portable came out in 1989, followed by the PowerBook in 1991.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And Apple made the switch to the Power PC in 1995.\n\nBut let's face it:\u00a0 the 90's were defined by Windows, which gained in market share as lots of computer makers, peripheral designers, and software companies focused their efforts on that platform.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Apple went through a series of strategies (licensing the Mac OS, then not) and a series of CEOs.\n\nThe one really unique machine of that era was the handheld Newton, which had all the right concepts, but just didn't work all that well.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It paved the way for the Palm Pilot and today's Smartphones, but Apple didn't make it in any of those markets (at least not yet)\u00a0.\n\nIt was only after Apple aquired Next in late 1996 and Steve Jobs returned to Apple as CEO in 1997 that the company began its resurgence.\u00a0\u00a0 After many attempts to update the core Macintosh operating system, Apple finally succeeded with OS X, which took the Macintosh user interface and moved it on top of a Unix base with a lot of new features.\u00a0\u00a0 And the design of Macintoshes improved dramatically, from the first multicolored iMacs to the new white all-in-one design that continues to this day; to sophisticated desktops like the PowerMac Quad; to cool looking notebooks.\n\nIn recent months, Apple has made the transition to Intel chips, with new models of the iMac, MacBookPro and MacMini\u00a0 all supporting the new processor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI currently have a G4 tower at the office and a Mac mini at home (along with lots of Windows machines), and the Macs continue to stand out for their elegance and great design.\n\nIf there's one area of concern, it's software.\u00a0 Apple's own applications are quite elegant:\u00a0 iLife for the basic home applications; Final Cut for video editors; Aperture, etc.\u00a0\u00a0 But I worry a bit that its focus on its own applications has driven away some of the third-party support.\n\nOf course, what most people associate with Apple these days is not the Macintosh, but instead the nearly ubiquitous iPod.\u00a0\u00a0 Apple wasn't the first company to introduce a portable digital music player, but the iPod's introduction in 2001 changed the industry.\n\nI remember my first iPod, and I've been using new models ever since.\u00a0\u00a0 It has been by far the most successful digital music player, and its integration with the iTunes application on both Mac and Windows and the iTunes store is still heads and shoulder above what anyone else yet offers.\n\nIn the future, I hope to see Apple continue to set the bar for both hardware design and elegant integration of software.\u00a0\u00a0 Apple has been a key player in making computers and related technology a part of our lives; and no other company has done so much to make computers look so cool.",

        "text":"May 2010 Issue  Volume 11  Number 2\n\nProduct Reviews\n\nCan an Android Make Your Mobile Phone Accessible?\n\nIf you're like me and you watched countless hours of this spring's March Madness NCAA college basketball tournament, you probably heard plenty of promotions for the Droid cell phone. The Droid is one of several new phones using Google's new Android operating system. If you have been wondering what an android can do for you as far as cell phone accessibility, you've come to the right place. Along with my fellow lab rats at AFB TECH, I've been investigating a couple of phones with the Android operating system, and this article will discuss the accessibility that is being developed for this new line of cell phones and provide our initial thoughts on the line's progress.\n\nThe Phones\n\nGoogle launched the Android operating system in 2008. Android is an open-source operating system for cell phones in the smartphone category. Android phones compete with many of the smartphones we have reviewed in AccessWorld that use the Blackberry, iPhone, Windows Mobile, or Symbian OS operating systems. In January 2010, Android had 7.1 percent of the U.S. smartphone market, and its share has been rising steadily.\n\nSeveral manufacturers are building Android-based smartphones, and they are available from all U.S. carriers. Besides the Droid, which is manufactured by Motorola and available from Verizon Wireless, we also looked at the Nexus One, an unlocked smartphone from Google that can be used on AT&T and T-Mobile networks. The focus of this article is the software, so I don't want to spend a lot of time describing the hardware, but here are the basics. Android-based smartphones all feature touch-screen interfaces with virtual keyboards, and many also have physical QWERTY keyboards that slide or flip out. They each have a track-ball or directional pad (D-pad) type navigational control, as well as a volume toggle, headphone jack, and power button. Some, but not all, also have physical send and end keys for handling phone calls, something I will address later in this article.\n\nThe Droid phone showing icons on its touch screen interface.\n\nCaption: The Droid Phone\n\nThe Droid phone showing icons on its touch screen interface and its slide-out QWERTY keyboard\n\nCaption: The Droid phone and its QWERTY keyboard\n\nThe Nexus One has a track-ball for navigation, but it does not have a physical QWERTY keyboard or send and end keys. It is very similar in size and shape to the iPhone; in fact, my iPhone case fits the Nexus One perfectly. The Droid is similar, but a bit thicker because it has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard with a D-pad on the right side of the keyboard, but it has no physical send or end keys. In addition to all of the virtual buttons that can appear on the touch screen, these phones also have four touch buttons on the touch screen that are always there, and they are labeled \"Back,\" \"Menu,\" \"Home,\" and \"Search.\" The Droid runs Android version 2.0 and the Nexus One runs version 2.1.\n\nWhat About Accessibility?\n\nFor people with vision loss, the interesting work at Google is being done by the Eyes-Free project, led by blind scientist T.V. Raman and his colleagues Charles Chen and Svetoslav Ganov. Working to accommodate people with vision loss, as well as sighted people in situations where they cannot look at their phones, the Eyes-Free project began with a collection of Android applications aimed at making it easier to interact with the phones non-visually. Examples include the Talking Dialer, Talking Caller ID, and Talking Compass applications (apps). Building on this, they announced the TalkBack screen reader in October 2009 to provide spoken feedback when using the various apps available on Android phones and at the Android Market. This is enhanced by the SoundBack and KickBack apps that provide non-spoken feedback, such as beeps and clicks, and haptic\/vibratory feedback as you interact with the phone. You will need sighted assistance to go to the menu and choose settings and then accessibility to enable these apps, but they will then stay enabled as long as you don't go back and disable them.\n\nBecause the Android Market is a growing source for a wide array of third-party apps for these phones, the Eyes-Free team is also making it possible for designers to make their apps compatible with Eyes-Free functionality. They have resources available on the Google Resources page, and there is another page for developers.\n\nBringing it all together is the Eyes-Free Shell, which they are calling Marvin, after the paranoid and depressed robot in Douglas Adams' novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. You can make Marvin your home screen and make it your launching point for Eyes-Free apps. A video available on the Google Resources page notes that Marvin pulls together the various aspects of Eyes-Free for a more consistent and well-integrated interface. These accessibility features come at no extra cost, and they are available out of the box on all phones running Android version 1.6 or later.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nWith TalkBack, KickBack, and SoundBack enabled, you can move around the grid layout of the home screen\/desktop of your Android-based phone using the track-ball or D-pad. TalkBack will speak the names of the various items and applications, and SoundBack will emit a ding sound when moving from item to item. You cannot navigate to the touch buttons at the bottom of the screen that I mentioned earlier; these must be touched to activate. KickBack provides a short vibratory burst to indicate you have found the buttons, which also helps in learning how to find them non-visually. If an app has been designed properly, these features will allow a person with vision loss to use them independently.\n\nMarvin, the Eyes-Free Shell, allows you to use these features to more efficiently use your Android phone. With Marvin's home screen up, you can think of the touch screen as a 3 by 3 grid of controls, much like a dialing grid on a standard phone. You can move your finger around the screen and it will speak the action under your finger. You then simply lift up and it activates that action. However, you don't have to know exactly where the buttons are because Eyes-Free employs what they call \"relative positioning.\" Wherever you touch the screen will be the 5 position, and then you can move relative from that position to the other positions in the grid. Moving from 5 in a northwestern direction up to the 1 position, you will hear it say \"signal strength,\" and if you lift your finger, it will tell you how strong your connection is. The 2 position is for time and date and 3 is for battery level. Although it certainly helps to begin as close to the center of the screen as you can, the nice thing is you don't always have to hit a precise position to begin.\n\nI won't get into all of the other controls on Marvin's home screen, but the 6 position is interesting. It is for location information, and Android uses Google Maps along with cell towers and satellites to tell you your general location, usually accurate to within a block.\n\nThe 8 position is for launching applications, and when you activate that control, Marvin has a unique way of quickly launching the app you want. Using what they call the \"stroke dialer,\" you can type the first letter of the app you want and then choose from a list of apps starting with that letter. Here's how it works. Starting again near the middle of the screen and moving in a northwestern direction toward the top left corner, you will hear it say the letter A. Moving your finger in a circular clockwise direction, you will hear B, C, D, all the way to the letter H. For I through P, begin by moving straight up in a northern direction. For Q through X, start by going in a northeastern direction to the top right. For Y, Z, a series of punctuation marks, and the backspace key, start by moving in an eastern direction. When you hear the first letter of the app you want, just lift your finger and you can then use the track-ball or D-pad to navigate and choose the app you want. For example, you could go to the letter C and launch contacts and begin scrolling through your contacts. Note: the punctuation marks were not spoken by TalkBack.\n\nHow Do You Dial a Phone Number?\n\nAlthough most of us who use smartphones usually place calls from the contacts list or the call log, we still occasionally have to dial a phone number directly. The Talking Dialer app, which is integrated into Marvin, is activated by touching the button labeled \"Search\" on the lower right corner of the screen. The KickBack app gives vibrates to indicate you have found the button, and you are now ready to enter the digits. Again, this app uses \"relative positioning,\" so wherever you place your finger is the 5, and the rest of the dialing grid is positioned relative to that spot.\n\nLet's say you want to dial an 800 number. Start by placing your finger in the middle of the screen; slide down one position and lift your finger and you will hear it speak the number 8 and an 8 is placed into the number you are dialing. SoundBack emits a tick sound to indicate when you have passed into the area of the screen for an 8. For the 0, you again place your finger in the middle of the screen and this time move down two ticks and lift your finger to enter a 0. When finished with all the digits, touch the Search button on the bottom right corner and you will hear the digits you have entered. Touch it again to place the call.\n\nYou shake the phone once to delete a character you have misdialed, and twice to clear all digits. To end a call, you have to touch a virtual button that appears on the screen about a third of the way up from the bottom. With advice from T.V. Raman of Google's Eyes-Free project, I placed a stick-on dot on the back of the phone to help me orient my fingers to the right spot. That also helps with finding the correct place to swipe your finger to answer or ignore a call. One drawbac... (truncated)",

        "text":"Here comes 8Gig Fibre Channel\n\nNew 8Gb\/sec host bus adapters (HBAs) and switch devices have started arriving. But with storage arrays incorporating the new, higher speed technology still months away, end-to-end 8Gb storage infrastructures are still in the planning stages. Storage managers can get a jump on their 8Gig configurations by upgrading switches and HBAs now, or by considering networking gear that supports Fibre Channel over Ethernet.\n\nThis article can also be found in the Premium Editorial Download: Storage magazine: Exploring the solid-state storage advantage:\n\nSwitches and host bus adapters are available, but 8Gb\/sec arrays won't be released until next year.\n\nUNLIKE THE PREVIOUS Fibre Channel (FC) specification transition from 2Gb\/sec to 4Gb\/sec in 2004, there may be a legitimate enterprise need for 8Gb\/sec FC.\n\n\"There are some select applications that require 8Gb\/sec FC right now, like high-definition video,\" says Tim Lustig, solutions architect at QLogic Corp.\n\nHowever, \"the key driver for 8Gb\/sec is virtualization and server consolidation,\" says Kyle Fitze, director of SAN marketing at Hewlett-Packard (HP) Co. Large companies are adopting virtualization to consolidate thousands of servers. Bob Gill, managing director, servers at TheInfoPro, a New York City-based research organization, says \"95% of respondents [to our latest survey] state that virtualization is critical to achieving their business objectives.\"\n\nNot like 4Gb\/sec\nWhen Storage first wrote about the transition from 2Gb\/sec to 4Gb\/sec FC, the big question was what organizations would do with the extra performance. At that time, almost no organization, regardless of size, was saturating its 2Gb\/sec pipes, said Tony Asaro, then a senior analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), Milford, MA.\n\nThe transition promised to be transparent and painless, and there was no price premium attached to 4Gb\/sec components. At the time, Framingham, MA-based IDC Corp. predicted that after the industry began 4Gb\/sec FC general shipments in 2005, it would achieve 90% market penetration within two years.\n\nToday, 8Gb\/sec FC products are being announced or released. By virtualizing three, four or more servers within a single physical server, organizations will generate considerably more I\/O. \"In that case, you'll need more ports and more bandwidth,\" says ESG analyst Bob Laliberte.\n\nVirtualization can benefit from bigger network pipes, just as it benefits from increased memory. However, \"even with virtualization, you're not automatically going to saturate your pipes,\" says Greg Schulz, founder and senior analyst at StorageIO Group in Stillwater, MN. Most of the apps virtualized aren't high I\/O database transaction apps that would benefit from the performance kick of 8Gb\/sec FC.\n\n\"We tested four applications on one processor and we hit an HBA [host bus adapter] bottleneck at 50,000 IOPS,\" says QLogic's Lustig. With 8Gb\/sec, the HBA bottleneck could be pushed off until 200,000 IOPS.\n\nEnd to end\nAt this point, 8Gb\/sec FC is available for the server and switch components of the SAN. Here's the rub for the storage architect: \"Behind the switch, you still have 4Gb\/sec storage,\" notes Lustig. Even with HP, which has been actively cheerleading 8Gb\/sec FC, the storage arrays remain at 4Gb\/sec. \"For complete 8Gb\/sec throughput end to end, you'll need 8Gb\/sec to the disk array,\" says the firm's Fitze.\n\nThere's usually a lag between when new technology components are introduced and when they're built into general-purpose storage arrays. HP expects to release an 8Gb\/sec EVA array in 2009. Other vendors will probably follow in the same timeframe.\n\nThe industry will follow what it did with the previous FC speed transition; the 8Gb\/sec components will automatically sense slower components and ratchet down the speed. As a result, the best an organization can do, end to end, today is 4Gb\/sec--unless it wants to aggregate pairs of 4Gb\/sec array ports.\n\nSpecialty storage vendor Facilis Technology Inc. demonstrated an end-to-end 8Gb\/sec FC SAN for use in the high-resolution video industry in April using 8Gb\/sec FC components from Atto Technology Inc. But like general-purpose storage vendors, Facilis is taking time to do the final engineering. \"We're waiting for boards so we can do more testing and benchmarking,\" says Kathy Kane, director of business development.\n\nNew SAN offerings\nBrocade Communications Systems Inc. recently announced the availability of 8Gb\/sec FC switches and HBAs. Beyond speed, Brocade is promising to build in advanced capabilities for QoS and support for virtual server mobility through dynamic state migration of link and port personality profiles.\n\nIBM Corp. has announced three new 8Gb\/sec switches: IBM System Storage SAN24B-4, SAN40B-4 and SAN80B-4. Pricing starts at $5,360, and the switches have higher port counts (up to 24, 40 and 80 ports, respectively) and, according to IBM, consume less power than previous models. IBM is also releasing three new 8Gb\/sec switch blades for the IBM TotalStorage SAN256B director. And Cisco Systems Inc. will offer a \"transparent\" upgrade to 8Gb\/sec for its MDS 9500 Series directors in Q4.\n\nInfiniBand update\n\n  \u2022 InfiniBand is an industry standard, channel-based, switched-fabric interconnect protocol for servers and storage. Today, it offers three levels of performance: 2.5Gb\/sec, 10Gb\/sec and 30Gb\/sec for low-latency, high-aggregate throughput.\n\n  \u2022 InfiniBand is deployed primarily between servers in clusters for the purposes of high performance or failover. It's positioned to be complementary to Fibre Channel and 10GbE. The InfiniBand Trade Association envisions storage networks connecting into the edge of the InfiniBand fabric to communicate with the high-performance compute resources found there.\n\n  \u2022 \"InfiniBand is mainly for high-performance computing. It has limited opportunities in enterprise storage,\" says Mike Karp, senior analyst at Boulder-based Enterprise Management Associates. \"How many protocols do you really want to support in your data center?\"\n\nPrice premium\nThe move to 8Gb\/sec FC will entail a price hike, at least initially. \"The 8Gb\/sec components require new optics. The price won't drop to 4Gb\/sec levels until the volumes ramp up,\" says Scott McIntyre, VP of software and customer marketing at Emulex Corp. Adds Mario Blandini, Brocade's director of product marketing: \"There will be a 20% to 30% price premium over 4Gb\/sec components initially.\"\n\nFor the extra money, 8Gb\/sec components will bring some new capabilities. \"These involve how data corruption is handled and how you authenticate the host to the FC fabric,\" says McIntyre. For example, there'll be more Cyclic Redundancy Checks (usually a mathematical checksum), which detect data alteration during transmission or when stored by comparing the data stream going in and coming out.\n\nOne upshot of the transition to 8Gb\/sec FC may be improved energy conservation. \"You may be able to turn off lanes on the PCI bus and power off lanes in the HBA and ports,\" says QLogic's Lustig. These green capabilities, however, will come from new firmware and software, not from the 8Gb\/sec HBA alone.\n\nAlthough 8Gb\/sec FC doubles FC performance, it still comes up shy of 10Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE). However, FC enterprises can achieve 10GbE speed through Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE). With FCoE, the FC protocol and FICON run native on a premium lossless, low-latency and QoS-enabled Ethernet. FC becomes just another network protocol running at 10Gb\/sec alongside IP on the 10GbE network.\n\nFCoE also allows convergence at the cabling level through a single Ethernet cable handling both FC and IP. FCoE will appeal to enterprises with FC SANs but with no plans to migrate to iSCSI and Ethernet. \"It lets organizations with FC and FICON preserve their FC skills and tools,\" explains StorageIO Group's Schulz. They can converge their network to a fast 10GbE backbone and reap savings by running and maintaining only one set of cabling for all traffic. (For more, see \"FCoE: Coming to a data center near you\".)\n\nBecause FCoE doesn't use TCP\/IP, it isn't routable. In addition, at this point FCoE is considered local technology only. \"FC shops that want to follow strategies requiring long distance, such as remote mirroring, should look to FCIP [Fibre Channel over IP] or other protocols,\" says Schulz.\n\nTo use FCoE, organizations will have to deploy a Converged Network Adapter (CNA) that will look to the server as both an FC HBA and an Ethernet NIC. A number of vendors have declared support for FCoE, including switch makers like Brocade and Cisco and component makers like Emulex and QLogic. Despite industry support, \"this technology is still in its infancy,\" adds Schulz. \"It will be 2010 before FCoE is ready for use by anyone except early adopters.\" (See \"Fibre Channel over Ethernet roadmap,\" PDF below.)\n\nFibre Channel over Ethernet roadmap (PDF)\n\nClick here for the Fibre Channel\nover Ethernet roadmap\n\nBeyond 8Gb\/sec FC\nThe Fibre Channel Industry Association, which manages the FC roadmap (see \"Fibre Channel roadmap,\" PDF below), is signaling the next performance jump to 16Gb\/sec. Work on the 16Gb\/sec FC specification is underway with completion slated for 2009. Actual products should be delivered by 2011. After that, the future gets murky with development of 32Gb\/sec, 64Gb\/sec and even 128Gb\/sec FC dependent on market interest.\n\nFibre Channel roadmap(PDF)\n\nClick here for the Fibre Channel roadmap (PDF).\n\nWith storage arrays incorporating 8Gb\/sec technology still months away, there isn't much for a storage manager to do right now. If an organization needs the performance of 8Gb\/sec FC, it can begin upgrading to available switches and HBAs, or it can ponder a future jump to FCoE. When the time comes to finally make the move to end-to-end 8Gb\/sec FC, prices should have dropped. Otherwise, sit tight.\n\nThis was last published in July 2008\n\nDig Deeper on Fibre Channel (FC) SAN\n\n\n\nFind more PRO+ cont... (truncated)",

        "text":"Will The Galaxy Note 9 Be Worth The Wait?\n\nWhile the Galaxy S9 is the phone on everyone\u2019s mind due to the launch in just a few days, there are many fans of the Note line that are looking forward to the Galaxy Note 9. What exactly can we expect from the Galaxy Note 9, and will it deliver something more exceptional than the Galaxy S9?\n\nThe Galaxy S9 is the latest and greatest from Samsung, and there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s an upgrade over the Galaxy S8. The question is, however, whether it\u2019s enough of an upgrade to deserve all of the hype surrounding the launch of a brand new Samsung flagship. In truth, there were not a lot of upgrades with the Galaxy S9 that warrant buying a new phone if you\u2019re already the owner of a Galaxy S8. Sure, there are power upgrades and some tweaks to the camera to produce even more beautiful pictures, but many people were disappointed with the lack of new features coming with the latest entry to such a popular lineup.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9 Concept Bixby 2.0\nImage Source: Concept Creator \/ YouTube video (screenshot)\n\nMany are looking forward to the Galaxy Note 9 as a release that will reinvigorate the Samsung line and bring something new to the table. With a release that is pretty far away at this point, it\u2019s difficult to pin down what exactly we can expect from the launch of the Galaxy Note 9, but considering the extra time Samsung has for development, there\u2019s certainly a possibility we could see something more revolutionary from the upcoming phone.\n\nSamsung has played it safe the past few generations, offering iterative upgrades over the previous phones that are a clear improvement while failing to offer anything new or exciting. The Galaxy Note 8 was a clear upgrade over the Note 7 \u2013 a phone that Samsung had to completely write off as a loss due to the issue of an exploding battery. As such, the Note 8 sold incredibly well as it offered the same features that many people look for with the Note line \u2013 a large \u201cphablet\u201d of sorts with the signature stylus that offers a unique way to use the phone. Samsung has proven that they have a winning formula, with excellent sales with each generation. There\u2019s always room for improvement, however, and they stand to make a massive profit with the launch of the Galaxy Note 9 if they can offer something we haven\u2019t seen before.\n\nThe two major players in the smartphone scene are Apple and Samsung, with the two companies neck and neck as they compete for the attention of an increasingly fickle smartphone market. With the release of the iPhone X, Apple managed to dominate holiday sales \u2013 shipping the fastest selling iPhone in history. With a revolutionary FaceID technology that adapts to changes in appearance while maintaining important security features, we saw something brand new that kept people talking and buying \u2013 despite the $1000 price tag that made it one of the most expensive phones in history. While the iPhone X has failed to meet sales expectations by a slim margin, it was still a major force in the smartphone industry that brought something new to a table \u2013 proving that innovation and departing from a formulaic approach to smartphone design can pay off in a big way.\n\nWith the Galaxy S9, we got a phone that was pretty similar to the S8. With the Galaxy Note 9, there are a number of things that Samsung can do in order to make the phone stand out from its predecessor. With a fall release, it will be competing closely with the trio of iPhones expected around the same time. With close attention to the needs of the market, the company has a chance to introduce something novel and get people talking about the Galaxy Note 9 in the same way they were talking about the iPhone X.\n\nAs far as features we might be able to expect from the Galaxy Note 9, we\u2019d first like to see some more refinements of their current design formula. As screen sizes get bigger and bezels continue to shrink, Samsung had to relocate their fingerprint scanner to the rear of the device. There are rumors that an under-display fingerprint scanner is in development, and that would be a way to further refine their formula while offering something new. Further improvements to Bixby might be able to bring it in line with Siri, giving a unique virtual assistant that can outclass the competition. Perhaps some sort of facial recognition advancement would make it harder to choose an Apple phone as well, with Samsung phones generally having more powerful specifications than the iPhone.\n\nSamsung has proven that they are capable of innovation with the ongoing development of the world\u2019s first foldable flagship \u2013 the Galaxy X. While adding something as drastic as a foldable screen to the Galaxy Note 9 may be a little extreme \u2013 at least for now \u2013 we hope to see at least some sort of departure from what the Korean tech giant has been doing for the past generations. At the end of the day, we have a bit of a wait until we know what exactly we can expect from the latest revamp of the Note line.",

        "text":"New PC Hardware Review \u2013 The Nvidia RTX 2080\n\nNvidia RTX 2080 reviewIf there is one piece of hardware everyone has been expecting for some time now, it\u2019s the Nvidia RTX 2080, and it\u2019s finally here. The graphics card is finally opening a door for many people out there to experience new graphics in a way that only high-end gamers were able to.\u00a0 The GPU is a 20-series mainstream component that lacks a budget-conscious price tag, but it packs quite a punch since it retains the special silicon that allows entry into ray-traced grounds with no problems. It\u2019s also an open GTU that has the ability to work with older components.\n\nIt can process six Giga Rays per second of RT Core. Most of the performance resides in the Turing GPU while scraping minimum rated specs for real-time ray tracing. There are still very few games out there capable of challenging this new GPU, but this certainly hasn\u2019t stopped Nvidia from pursuing a big marketing strategy and the announce of third parties embracing the specs of the RTX 2080 to make it attractive to the market in the short run. The official announcement was released in the CES 2019 convention held in Las Vegas.\n\nSpecs \u2013 What we know so far\n\nMake no mistake; this brand new GPU is undoubtedly a work of art by itself. Before the RTX 2080 came along, very few components managed to pull off the five billion rays per second to achieve entry-level ray tracing. To hit those numbers gamers had to blow at least four figures in state of the art technology. Nvidia just changed all that by offering a GPU capable of retaining 30 SMs worth of ray trace silicon in a full-fat TU106 GPU. If we take the word of Nvidia on these numbers, it means that it can handle 1,920 CUAD Cores, 30 RT-Cores, and 240 Tensor Cores. If you compare this performance with past achievements, the company has managed to create a GPU that can show off better graphics at increased 50% increased better quality than the old GTX 1060.\n\nThe power of the silky silicon components is stored in a 445mm2 GPU that is kept cool very noticeable twin axial shroud cooler. This fan cooler is the same one used in most of the 20-series First Edition cards. If there was some room from improvement from previous designs, making the GPU slicker certainly could have helped. This is the first 20-series graphics card that comes with no pre-overclock from the factory. Most of Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX cards come with it, so it certainly feels like a fresh change of pace for customizers and builders. The card has been tested with a 1,680MHz GPU boost clock that works perfectly fine for the TU106 GPU inside. So far the lowest combination that has run the card properly is a build featuring 6GB of GDDR6 delivering 14Gbps with an aggregate 192bit bus. The resulting 336GB per sec bandwidth is enough to keep that GPU running at full power.\n\nYou might be interested:\n> PS4 Emulator for Android, iOS, Windows & macOS\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe RTX 2080 is not a budget GPU by any means, but there is nothing quite like it in the market either. At $350 a unit, you certainly expect a lot out of it, and you will probably get it if you have the right parts to go with it. Nvidia has certainly taken one step forward in the graphics department by offering state of the art tech at prices that doesn\u2019t hurt the wallet. It doesn\u2019t help much that the company is competing with itself by releasing a similar model of a product they still have in stock such as it happens with the Nvidia GTX 1070 Ti that was launched back in the day priced at $460. If you are wondering if the RTX 2080 has good value, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d Graphics enthusiasts will surely feel delighted at the sharpness of most images coming out of their screens. The only issue right now is that only designers and renderers can get the most out of it. Gamers will need to have a little more patience as more developers make their games compatible with it.",

It's a natural way to navigate around virtually, especially in Safari. But the new motion has some side effects -- you can't swipe from left to right any longer to delete an email message. I almost cried when I realized this. Seriously. A grown man sobbing over his iPhone. Ok, I don't do tears, but I did swear.\n\nBy Chris Maxcer MacNewsWorld ECT News Network\nSep 23, 2013 5:00 AM PT\n\niOS 7 is available from Apple for free.\n\niOS7 iPhone iPad\n\nI am simultaneously excited and saddened by iOS 7 on my iPhone 5. My first impression? All over the freaking map. iOS 7 is at once a fantastic and fresh update, while it's also full of maddeningly stupid icons, buttons and colors. It has better customization, a more intimate and lively feel -- and yet, you're stuck with a palette of soft-but-too-bright pastel-ish colors.\n\nThe red? That's not red. It's a travesty, and I'm not color blind. Imagine the color palette applied to your car. If you like that idea, iOS 7 is for you. For the rest of us, we're stuck with it, and we have to look at Apple's new colors every day we remain iOS users.\n\nThis represents a fundamental flaw in Apple's vision of iOS -- an inability to tone down stupid colors or change them altogether. You would think Apple would know this -- after all, Steve Jobs started the whole thing with the first iMacs. The tradeoff is device-to-device usability. I can look at anyone else's iPhone and immediately know how to navigate, how to use it, and how to show them how to do something. That's important, and I get that there's a trade-off between customization and cohesion among all iOS users -- but Apple is not hitting the sweet spot with iOS 7 customization. Sorry. Not even close.\n\nSo what would be welcome? The ability to saturate or desaturate the color palette, to tone it up or even make it all black and white -- just as if you were editing a photo. This kind of setting would give consumers a better sense of control while maintaining a consistent look and feel. Instead of a neonish green color for your Messages, FaceTime and Phone apps, you could adjust the color to make it use a darker, richer green for your Phone app, for example.\n\nInstead, we get a very slight ability to change the tone of your phone through background images. If you set your wallpaper to a photo of a green lawn, a green tone will bleed into the transparent layer above -- the background color for your bottom row of apps will appear greenish. Use blue sky, you get a blue tone. iOS 7 takes the dominant color from your home screen photo and uses it for you. That's cool, but it's just a start.\n\nStill, Awesomeness Abounds\n\nDespite the lackluster controls for color and customization, there's a lot to like about iOS 7. The sense of layers and animated transitions does make your iPhone feel a little more alive. In fact, in some cases the new transitions make my iPhone 5 seem faster and snappier. Mail, for instance, seems much faster than before -- and I'm not sure if this is truly the case or if it's just an illusion based on the transitions among my various in-boxes and messages. Either way, I like it.\n\nOverall, I like the new airy and modern feel of the new font, which seems to be some variation of Helvetica Neue. But then again, this sense of airiness gets taken too far in some places so that \"buttons\" are now simply text with maybe a thin < or > to indicate direction. Understandable? Pretty much always -- but not always at a glance. The button motifs were cues for your eye to recognize the activity you wanted, and clearly, iOS 7 will force you to pay more attention to your iPhone than you have in years -- and retrain your brain in the process.\n\nThe question is, will I learn to recognize the flashlight icon in Control Center? The funky little clock icon in Control Center that doesn't match the Clock app icon? Yes. But I can tell you this: It's going to take more than 48 hours before I can work my phone with the autopilot ease I enjoyed with iOS 6.\n\nSo what are the best new features?\n\nControl Center. If you swipe from the bottom of your screen up, you'll bring up the Control Center layer, which sports frequently used controls like Airplane mode, the clock, camera, screen brightness, and WiFi, among others. The basic feature is not new to other smartphones, but it's new to iOS users.\n\nMultitasking. Multitasking in the new iOS 7 is really a hidden gem -- you don't realize how much improved it is until you use it. Double-tap the home button and you'll get a row of active app icons as well a horizontal scrollable thumbnail view of your open apps. Swipe an app thumbnail up, and boom, you close the running app. Tap the thumbnail or the app icon and you'll rise up into the app in full screen. Not only does it look fantastic, it works fantastically well, too.\n\nCamera App. The new Camera app lets you swipe between modes across the full main screen of the app -- so, to switch from photo mode to video mode, all you have to do is swipe. That's right, there's no painfully small little toggle switch to find and mess with while you're trying to capture a moment. You can also swipe to a square photo frame or a panoramic mode. If you want to look at a scene through a filter while you decide to capture it, you can apply a handful of filters with a new button option. All goodness here.\n\nPhotos. The new Photos app is one of my favorites now. Before, I used it all the time but found it a clunky pain. The iOS 7 Photos app breaks up all your photos into Years, Collections and Moments. It makes it so much easier to find your photos and videos to edit them, share them -- everything. Plus, you can share an entire moment -- a whole set of photos and videos.\n\nTap a \"share\" word (not a button anymore) and you can AirDrop them via WiFi or Bluetooth (cool) or message them or even copy them to the clipboard to paste them into email or elsewhere. Very nice. Oh, and you can create Albums, too, if you so desire. The bottom line is, the Camera app received a massive redesign that simply sings.\n\niTunes Radio. Built into the Music app, iTunes Radio is a free streaming music service that lets you listen to channels by genre or create your own via artists that you like. It rocks. It's easy to use, works great, and if you hear a song you want to buy, you can snap it up from iTunes super fast. The interface isn't particularly amazing, but the functionality? Love it so far. Groundbreaking? Not so much. But it's a good implementation that's built into your iOS experience.\n\nSafari. While you don't get tabbed browsing on an iPhone 5 -- no horizontal room -- you do get a new page option that stacks the open and recent Web pages that you have visited in a sort of file-folder sort of way. At first glance, it looks clunky and dumb, but after using it, it feels alive and handy. I'm sold.\n\nPlus, when you scroll down through a Web page, the top control bar shrinks and the bottom bar disappears. The quick animation of the move is perfect. And you can now swipe to go back. And use a unified URL\/search field. It all adds up to a Safari that will continue to be the most-used mobile browser around.\n\nFeatures That Will Get Better With Time\n\nThere's lots of little goodies tucked away into iOS 7 -- for instance, time stamps for each message in the Message app. If you slide your finger to the left -- a grab and pull, really -- you'll pull the text messages to the left to reveal a list of time stamps along the right side. Teenagers, take note. Sometimes you need a better sense of time than what was shown in iOS 6.\n\nAirDrop may very well turn out to be quite useful with your colleagues, friends and family. Instead of bumping phones, iOS 7 lets you see other nearby phones via WiFi or Bluetooth, and lets you send and receive files. Pretty cool. But you have to remember to use it -- otherwise, you'll just be emailing or messaging through your old-school habits.\n\nSwiping from left to right to go back is starting to get my attention. It's a natural way to navigate around virtually, especially in Safari. I expect to see it used more frequently throughout iOS in the future, as well as in more apps. But the new motion has some side effects -- you can't swipe from left to right any longer to delete an email message. I almost cried when I realized this. Seriously. A grown man sobbing over his iPhone. Ok, I don't do tears, but I did swear.\n\nThen I remembered that you can now swipe from right to left, which gives you a big red Trash button, along with a More button that lets you do things like forward, reply, or move a message. This feature is actually really cool -- I'll just have to retain my brainstem over the next few days to learn to take advantage of it.\n\nThings That Will Take Some Getting Used To\n\nThe new Reminders app lost its old leather-bound notebook paper skin, and while the new iOS 7 version is snappy fast, it's full of Apple's new color palette, and the main set of lists seems too bulky vertically. My question is, will I learn to love it? Or ditch it for a third-party app? It's 50-50 right now.\n\nThe Calendar app is much whiter -- with smaller text -- and hard to follow and read at first, but it's getting progressively better for me. I'll probably stick with it. The Notes app? No more yellow-lined paper. The new Notes app is white, fast and tidy, but I sort of miss the horizontal lines for lists. I like the blank canvas for notes in paragraph form, though. Win some, lose some.\n\nAll-in-all, I've got other quibbles and have found other little delights, too, but the point is this: iOS 7 is a great leap forward. It's free and easy to install, but there's no easy way to go back to iOS 6 if you don't like it. This is one of the sacrifices you make as an Apple enthusiast -- keep up, get left behind or walk away. No matter what, though, when you run into the inevitable... (truncated)",

        "text":"Ray tracing is the big topic in graphics cards industry in these days. In a past half of a year actually. And it's just starting.\n\n\nNvidia said they are going to enable DXR real time ray tracing on GTX 10 and 16 series graphics cards. So you will be able to RTX ON on your GTX 1070 GPU. So RTX ON, GAME ON, let's play!\n\nPlay what? And when?\n\nWhat do you want to play first? A shooter? An RPG? How about some RTS game? Well, you and I both know it's really simple choice because there are still only two games you can play with DXR - Battlefield V and Metro Exodus. Not bad choices, but also not for everyone. My choice will be Metro as soon as the new driver comes out.\n\nNvidia will enable a DXR option for GTX cards in April driver update. The exact release date is unknown, but we expect it around the half of the month. There are probably going to be also updates of those two games to fully support this. Game developers tightly cooperate with Nvidia engineers and this is reason to believe that if there would be a game update, it'll be around the same date.\n\n\nThe thing is, if Nvidia spent 10 years of developing tensor units so they can provide a real time ray tracing, how they can just enable this function on CUDA cores graphics cards?\n\nIt's not \"just enable\", that's how it appears to us, consumers. Tensor cores are made for this purpose and they are still hotter than Titan X in its calculating prime time, that's why many need a triple slot cooler design. But they are still computing units like CUDA, only more powerful. So there is nothing that would prevent to use a DXR on them.\n\nNothing but a raw power. Simply put - tensor cores are more powerful than CUDA cores so they can calculate the light paths faster and are more efficient.\n\nIn reality we expect very functioning real time ray tracing, just not very playable experience. You know how are games that everybody complains about how not optimized they are? It could be like that, just in this case it's not about optimization, but about addition - you add the ray tracing.\n\nWhy do that?\n\nIt the experience is not supposed to be playable? Why? Ray tracing is a future in gaming graphics. You may not like it but it's not changing the fact. Nvidia put a lot of effort and even more money to develop this technology, to put it inside something this small and now they market the sh*t out of it. Next generation of RTX cards is going to be even more into it.\n\nThey want to show consumers how the ray tracing looks in games. Yes, it's probably because they want you to buy an RTX card, but for me it's doing something else - showing even more of their effort, that they want this trend to continue and that is worth investing in the new RTX video card because they keep working on it.\n\nIn April I'll get back to this and tell you about the real experience from DXR on GTX 1080 Ti.\n\nPublished 25.03.2019 17:17\nAbout author\nTom J.\n\nTom is a founder and CEO of Profit Visions company.

Over the years, a Windows and Mac PC have proven too complicated for most regular consumers. There are so many things you have to think about, from viruses to updates and configurations. Too many things to manage. Who has time to do it properly, even if one knew how?\n\nIt starts when you unpack a Windows or Mac PC from the box. Just getting it set up can take 30 minutes or more, depending on your individual situation. Over the last 25 years, every time I got a new laptop I probably spent the better part of a weekend getting it set up to my liking.\n\nI know some aspects of Windows 8 and the latest Macs have gotten better about the initial setup time, but it still pales in comparison with a Google Chromebook. Why? Because on a Google Chromebook you are fully set up in barely 30 seconds. After that initial set-up, you boot up from cold in approximately 10 seconds.\n\nThat's for one user. What if you want lend your laptop to someone else, say a child or a friend or a co-worker? Getting set up for that takes some effort on a Windows or Mac PC.\n\nMust Read: Carl Icahn Is at It Again, Attacking eBay\n\nOn a Chromebook? No effort at all. You can have anyone use your PC on a moment's notice, without co-mingling any data or other files. That's a key reason Chromebooks are taking over the education market: Several kids can share one laptop without risk or bureaucracy.\n\nThe key point is this: A Chromebook is the right kind of device for a child or elderly person -- or just someone who isn't a full-time computer geek or expert -- because it makes the whole experience around basic maintenance into a big zero.

There are a growing number of companies dedicated to nothing but this purpose, but adapting that content over time can be even more of a challenge without the right approach.\n\nIn order to provide your clients with digital signage that will continue to be relevant, engaging, and profitable over time, integrators should be delivering content in a way that is easy to update and manage, that is interactive, and that provides feedback.\n\nIf you have been in the digital signage arena for any amount of time, you are aware that there are many ways to deliver content to the screen. As integrators, you have seen everything from stand alone solid state media players, to webbased HTML pages, to dedicated PCs, to cloud-based streaming and everything in between. The challenge for many integrators is that there is not one de facto standard to learn and train technicians on. Many integrators have not yet developed the IT skillsets to manage remote PCs or server\/client networks and many are still uncomfortable with solutions that rely on internet connectivity for real time streaming of the content.\n\nFor this reason, I argue that integrators should be looking for content management systems that utilize dedicated hardware at each screen that plays the content locally to avoid potential issues with web-based page loading or cloud-based video streams. The hardware should have the ability to be updated over the web or via the cloud periodically to adjust and update the messaging as needed. Choosing a system with an intuitive portal that manages the screens and content deployment is ideal if you wish to avoid managing an FTP site and a list of Mac and IP addresses. Finally, integrators should be looking for systems that actively manage the addresses of the player devices in dynamic IP environments, to avoid having to set up static IP addresses or web server protocols for each device.\n\nIf we accept that \u201cContent is King\u201d, then \u201cContext\u201d is definitely its Queen. Content can be developed in a way that it provides both a breadth and depth of knowledge or information. However, we all know that some of that content will be more relevant to one person than to another. The days of looping content in a constant playback reel are fading fast. Most people will not stand and watch a content reel waiting to see if there is something relevant that they need to consume. If they catch a portion of content they deem relevant they may stop, but odds are they will not linger while the digital signage makes a lap through the reel to get back to the information that they want.\n\nTo truly be a useful tool, digital signage has to be interactive. Interactive digital signage allows the viewer to select the content they wish to consume, and by doing so, to create more engagement and a higher chance that the call to action will be responded to. Interactivity is another reason that dedicated hardware at the screen is a must, as each screen will be interacted with simultaneously in a different way. Providing headroom for new applications, by including multi-touch hardware upfront can also be valuable, as it provides future opportunities for a more engaging interface and to allow multiple users to work in tandem, creating a community around the client\u2019s brand.\n\nImplementing an interactive digital signage solution that provides feedback can take the clients\u2019 investment from a leap of faith to a proven return on investment. Integrators should be looking for systems that can gather metrics remotely, showing what content users interact with (another reason interactivity is a must). This allows the integrator to provide continual information to their clients that is invaluable in tailoring their message and updating content over time. It provides confirmation of what content is relevant to the audience at each screen, and allows the client to address each screen\u2019s audience in a different way to maximize the return on investment in the system. Providing feedback on how people utilize the screen and what content they consume makes you, as the integrator, a true partner in your client\u2019s business and helps them drive revenues.\n\nAbout the author\n\nMark Coxon - Sales, Mark\nMark started his technology career at IBM in 2000 before migrating into AV integration in early 2002.

        "text":"Bel Canto eVo 200.2 power amplifier Followup\n\nKalman Rubinson wrote a Followup in November 2001 (Vol.24 No.11):\n\nHow do you know when your system is really loud? If you don't have a sound-level meter, you can wait for your neighbors to complain or for your ears to bleed. But long before that point, a system will begin to give telltale signs\u2014like dynamic compression and increased distortion, which are often misinterpreted as meaning \"loud\" rather than \"distorted.\"\n\nWell, I don't generally get to that point with my regular equipment and musical preferences, and when I auditioned the $2395 Bel Canto eVo 200.2 power amplifier for the March 2001 Stereophile, I found nothing lacking in its ability to drive my speakers as loud as necessary. I was shocked when John Atkinson's test results showed that our review sample could not output its rated power because, according to Bel Canto's \"Manufacturer's Comment,\" the set-point of the protection circuitry was too conservative.\n\nBefore I learned any of this, I had already requested another eVo 200.2\u2014not because I felt I needed more power, but to set up the pair of them as bridged monoblocks. The amp's design invites bridging because the two channels in each eVo are connected to the power supply in opposite polarity. Feed in one signal, push a button, and bridged output is available without having to add any signal-inversion circuitry. It was no surprise that, in view of JA's results, Bel Canto sent me two spanking-new 200.2s, which I promptly bridged and biwired to my Revel Ultima Studio loudspeakers. I waited until no one was around, put on Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops' recording of the Polka and Fugue from Weinberger's Schwanda the Bagpiper (Telarc CD-80115), and let 'er rip.\n\nAll went gloriously well until the end, when, with the orchestral forces already in full cry, Telarc's infamous bass drum and a pipe organ pile on. Burp! The protection relays in the left-channel eVo clicked on and off, totally destroying the musical continuity. I reversed channels and, lo and behold, now the eVo on the right choked. Sure, the system had been turned up to 11\u2014something I almost never do\u2014but the problem was clearly related to the musical power demands of the left-channel signal. But with an estimated 800Wpc on tap, this should not have been happening.\n\nBoth EVos recovered from the ordeal just fine, and as I pondered whether to chalk up their burping to excessive expectations or to ask Bel Canto to take them back, the phone rang\u2014Bel Canto's Mike McCormick wanted to know how it was going. Before I could tell him the bad news, he volunteered that these amps, too, had had their protection cutoffs set too low. The fix was simple: Just open the amps and snip out one resistor from each. The entire process took less than five minutes; the hardest part was finding the right-size hex key for the chassis screws.\n\nAfter I'd snipped out the resistors, the EVos were unflappable. But without that suggestion from Bel Canto, there's no way to know from the outside what's going on inside the 200.2. If your experience of the amp has been anything like mine, give Bel Canto a call.\n\nThe bridged-and-snipped eVo was a bear of an amp. With the aforementioned Weinberger re-heated, the drum and organ bellowed forth on top of the orchestra, and nothing faltered. Except, perhaps, my resolve to do it again\u2014neighbors I'd never before spoken with complimented me on the music. Because no additional circuitry is required to bridge the 200.2, it was no surprise that, used as a monoblock, the eVo sounded much like one of its own stereo channels, but with seemingly limitless power. The midrange dryness and slightly analytic HF character that I'd noted in my original review with a single stereo 2000.2 were much reduced, but that perception is possibly related to my long use of and adaptation to them.\n\nOn the other hand, with continued exposure, a device with a characteristic flavor is just as likely to become annoying. But the eVo reminded me of Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat: The longer I listened, the more my concerns faded, until only my smile remained. I'll underscore this by saying that I wrote my effusive encomia (Stereophile, September 2001) about the sound quality made possible by the TacT RCS 2.0 room equalizer while the monoblock eVo 200.2s were doing the heavy lifting.\n\nThe monoblock EVo, however, was just as picky as the stereo eVo about getting the level just right for each recording. Finding this level became a regular but unstrenuous ritual for classical music\u2014a single tweak at the beginning usually served for the rest of the disc. With pop and jazz discs, whose miking and performers can change from track to track, a bit more involvement and work was required. The remote control of my Sonic Frontiers Line-3 preamplifier made this easier; the results were their own reward.\n\nHowever much I loved the eVo 200.2s, they exist in a complex context. Bel Canto has recently introduced eVo amplifiers with 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6 amplifier modules. I don't think you can go wrong with any of these options, as they all seem to be based on the same \"Tripath\" amp module. With the resistor snipped, the unleashed stereo 200.2 was even better than the original I auditioned, and had quite enough power for all but headbangers, or those with very inefficient speakers.\n\nWhen a single 200.2 will do, of course, there's no need for two. However, the multichannel EVos are blessed with a 1500VA power transformer rather than the 538VA transformer in the 200.2. And for those who need the muscle, a four-channel 200.4 is less expensive and less bulky than a pair of two-channel 200.2s. To use bridged EVos for each of my two stereo channels, I'd have to decide if the potential value of the 1500VA transformer in a 200.4 outweighed the advantage of using very short but very excellent speaker cables with a pair of 200.2s. While I lean toward the latter, what really intrigues me is a lateral move to a 200.5 for my multichannel system.\n\nYeah, that's the ticket\u2014EVos all around!\u2014Kalman Rubinson\n\nEnter your username.\nEnter the password that accompanies your username.",

The \"green\" side, if you will.\n\nDespite the animosity between NVIDIA and Intel surrounding their chipset business (think ION), the two are still very much partners in other aspects. Recently, NVIDIA demonstrated the willingness to reconcile differences by licensing their SLI technology for use on Intel's latest X58 and P55 chipsets. This eventually led to NVIDIA's current ongoing \"Power of 3\" campaign.\n\nYou might be scratching your heads and wondering what's this \"Power of 3\" campaign. Quite simply, it refers to the combination of Intel's P55 chipset, Lynnfield processors and NVIDIA's GPUs. SLI used to be exclusive to NVIDIA's nForce chipset, making multi-GPU configurations on an Intel motherboard impossible. But now that SLI is licensed for use on the new X58 and P55 chipsets, multi-GPU setups with NVIDIA graphics cards are now possible on Intel's newest boards. And with this, NVIDIA is positioning it as a better solution to a comparable all AMD platform.\n\nHence today, we are going to explore the potential the Power of 3 brings, and whether it is truly the better solution for users.

        "text":"Apple TV\n\nMonday's Apple event was full of Apple TV news, from Apple TV+ and Apple TV Channels to star-studded, Apple-backed original streaming content. But one critical thing was missing, though: no new Apple TV set-top box.\n\nThis would have been the ideal time to announce a new Apple TV device to go with these new features, but instead we're still stuck with the overpriced, two-year-old Apple TV 4K and it's even older, non-4K Apple TV for 1080p streaming. That's because Apple TV, as we know it, is dead or dying.\n\nOpinionsFor years, Apple TV has primarily been a media streamer, a physical device connected to your TV to let you watch iTunes movies and TV shows on the big screen. That changed this week as Apple started framing Apple TV purely as a service platform. While plenty of new features were described, Apple TV as a device was hardly mentioned. It was shown in a pile with the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook as just another platform that can use the service. Not a peep on hardware.\n\nIf that isn't enough of a hint that the physical Apple TV is on its way out, the announcement of Apple TV apps for smart TVs is another nail in its coffin. LG, Samsung, Sony, and Vizio TVs, along with Amazon Fire TV and Roku devices, will get Apple TV apps that provide access to Apple's iTunes video library later this year. We saw a hint of this at CES when Samsung announced it would be getting an iTunes app, but seeing such a wide selection of devices that will get Apple TV apps is shocking.\n\nApple TV\n\nAt $150 to $180, Apple TV hardware has long been too expensive when compared to Amazon Fire TV, Google Chromecast, and Roku TV devices, which start at $30 and offer 4K options beginning at $50. If you aren't deeply committed to iTunes and Apple's content ecosystem, that's a huge premium for a media streamer. Even the feature-laden Amazon Fire TV Cube, which streams 4K video and supports hands-free Amazon Alexa voice controls, costs significantly less than either Apple TV.\n\nIf you can access iTunes content on your smart TV, Roku, or Fire TV, what possible reason could you have to spend that much money on an Apple TV? iOS and macOS screen mirroring over AirPlay and perhaps button-press remote-bound Siri access are the only two options, and neither is very compelling (and AirPlay will also be separately added to several smart TVs later this year).\n\nIt's a smart move for Apple. Widening the availability of iTunes to other devices takes away its sense of exclusivity, but it means far more people will be able to spend money on movie and TV show rentals and purchases. That's a lot of revenue with no need for manufacturing or distribution of hardware. It's also hardly a loss for Apple fans, whose current Apple TVs will continue to work and also receive the new features, and who will be able to enjoy their iTunes library on their TV even if they don't have an Apple TV device.\n\nThis doesn't mean Apple is completely done with streaming hardware, though. As I mentioned, AirPlay is one of the few reasons to have an Apple TV. This is the perfect opportunity for Apple to reinvent the Apple TV as a streaming dongle like a Google Chromecast. Maybe call it an AppleCast or iCast. Make a smaller, simpler streaming device with no remote or on-screen interface that you control with your iPhone or iPad. Then set the price at less than half that of the 1080p Apple TV, to make it more competitive with at least the Chromecast Ultra, if not the standard Chromecast.\n\nYes, Apple would be coming to the streaming stick party several years late, but that's nothing new for Cupertino. It took far too long for the Apple TV to get a robust app store to access streaming services besides iTunes, and far too long after that for the 4K version of the device to come out. An Apple Chromecast equivalent that doesn't cost eight times as much would still be very compelling.\n\nThis is pure speculation, and Apple could simply let the Apple TV fade away. But whatever happens, it's clear the Apple TV media streamer is dying. And if you don't believe me, go to the Apple TV section on Apple's own website. Then start scrolling down, and consider how long it takes before you actually see the Apple TV 4K itself. It's just above the accessories.",

        "text":"comment on this article\n\nSpeed, density and connectivity\n\nIt\u2019s a given that designers of electronic products are under pressure to develop new, or look to the evolution of, products.\n\nBut whatever their approach they have to address key trends such as the need for higher densities, greater speeds, expanded connectivity and improved power management.\n\nThese pressures are just as acute for those involved in the development of industrial connectors and who find themselves under pressure to provide solutions that ensure that data is delivered more quickly and securely, or deliver more power, while at the same time ensuring connectors take up less space.\n\nThe impact of Industry 4.0 digitalisation processes on existing production plant environments, as companies look to use technology to raise productivity levels and reduce costs, is proving challenging.\n\n\u201cIndustry 4.0 has led to more complex set-ups. Large quantities of low latency data, acquired from sensing or monitoring devices, has to be distributed throughout the system and, of course, the factory floor presents an extremely challenging environment for any form of electronic component that is incorporated into the equipment being utilised - including connectors,\u201d says Wendy Jane Preston, Technical Marketing Engineer, at Harwin.\n\n\u201cA direct consequence of this approach is that we are seeing a more modular approach to production platforms,\u201d explains Howard Forryan, a product marketing specialist at Harting. \u201dThis can involve either the application of new modular machines into a production line or the retrofitting of existing installed equipment, to support a more modular and decentralised interconnected control system solution.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, it\u2019s an approach being used in even the harshest environmental plant conditions e.g. very high operating temperatures.\n\n\u201cConnectivity in industrial applications is a critical element and so the components providing this aspect need to be rugged enough to function accordingly. In this context there is the potential for not only on-going exposure to elevated temperatures, but heavy shocks or strong vibrational forces,\u201d says Preston.\n\n\u201cIn the past, limitations in the operating performance of a connector have often meant that equipment has had to be hard-wired in such situations,\u201d Forryan explains. \u201cHowever, new types of connectors are able to support greater flexibility in such conditions. As a result, reduced wiring complexity means that such an installation can be optimised and maintenance costs reduced.\u201d\n\nHarting has developed a range of special connectors for providing reliable solutions for such high-temperature environments. In the case of a bulkhead-side connector, seals must not melt or adhere to other integrated component parts over the full operating temperature range.\n\nMany hood and housing coatings and lacquers that are currently available on the market are not suitable for long-term use at high temperatures as they can cause melting which can, in turn, lead to mated parts sticking together.\n\n\u201cIn response Harting has developed a special surface treatment of the aluminium die-cast hoods and housings, meaning that we have been able to dispense with any potentially detrimental additional protective coating finish,\u201d Forryan explains.\n\nThe insulating body and contacts must be able to withstand the high ambient conditions of the location and the additional heat generated inside the housing when under mated load. Harting uses a high-temperature-resistant copper alloy contacts that maintain constant electrical properties when heated. In addition, high-temperature LCP plastic insulators ensure long service life.\n\nHigher density an issue\n\n\u201cWith ever more sophisticated systems to deploy, but less and less room in which to deploy them, higher density arrangements need to be utilised,\u201d suggests Preston.\n\n\u201cNot only will the constituent components have to fit into the confined space available, but they should also not create an obstacle that impinges on the system\u2019s thermal management activities (by obstructing the airflow passing over the boards on which they are situated).\n\n\u201cThough 2mm pitch connectors were quite acceptable a few years back, now lower profile connectors with much narrower pitches are being mandated.\u201d\n\nA durable plastic construction is also normally recommended, explains Preston, in order to maximise mechanical robustness.\n\n\u201cIt also, almost, goes without saying that a wide working temperature range will be considered obligatory,\u201d she adds.\n\nIn response to the changing needs of the industrial space , Harwin has come up with the Archer Kontrol series.\n\n\u201cSuited to a broad array of heavy industrial tasks, these 1.27mm pitch interconnect solutions exhibit a high degree of mechanical robustness, while at the same time delivering substantial flexibility.\n\n\u201cThey have a current rating of 1.2A per contact, and a choice of 12, 16, 20, 26, 40, 50, 68 or 80 pin versionsfor edge-to-edge, parallel board-to-board or right-angle mother-to-daughterboard orientations,\u201d explains Preston. \u201cAn extensive variety of different stacking heights are available for design flexibility, so that boards can be stacked together at spacings that are suitable for the rest of the equipment layout.\n\nWith a fully shrouded design, these connectors have strong resilience to vibration and other mechanical forces, while polarisation of the shroud and lead-in chamfers facilitate blind mating procedures.\n\n\u201cThey support 500 mating\/un-mating cycles, possess an insulation resistance of 1000M\u03a9 (minimum), can deal with 500V AC and have a working temperature range that spans from -55\u00b0C to +125\u00b0C,\u201d says Preston.\n\nWind power\n\nOne area of considerable change has been in the development of wind energy, which has now become a genuine economic alternative to fossil fuels.\n\nHarting supplies connectors with high-performance plastic and corrosion-resistant aluminium housings.\n\nThese include innovations within the Han-Eco series which includes a plastic connector that is fully compatible with the industry standard Han B while at the same time combining all the advantages of a plastic connector.\n\nImpervious to external environmental influences, the Han-Eco B allows rear mounting of the contact inserts in the bulkhead mounted housing, which can save considerable costs in the manufacturing process.\n\nIn addition, the Han-Eco Snap was designed for indoor applications and, with its separately detachable upper housing part, not only facilitates installation, but also enables potential measurement in an installed state.\n\nHarting has also developed an overvoltage module that can be integrated into the connector, so an applied overvoltage potential can be safely dissipated within the connector even before entering the switch cabinet.\n\nThe Han Configurator enables engineers to produce a design that can be viewed in 3D\n\n\nIn a move designed to aid and speed up the selection of heavy-duty industrial connectors Harting has also created what it calls the Han Configurator, an interactive tool that helps in the selection of heavy-duty industrial connectors.\n\nIt allows engineers to access all the necessary information and relevant data on the individual interface components prior to producing a design that can be viewed as a 3D model in real time. It helps generate solutions from an extensive portfolio, without the user having to be or become a component specialist himself.\n\nThe designer starts by selecting three inputs (contacts, voltage and current) to generate the first possible solution. At each stage of the process the user can receive suggestions for alternative interfaces and via the \u201csmart assistant\u201d feature the configurator will only allow valid configurations to be implemented, saving valuable design time.\n\nDespite increasingly complex requirements and a high level of product diversification, the smart configurator makes the connector selection process much more manageable.\n\nAn \u201cexpert\u201d mode, enables user who already know the product numbers or names they are looking to set up their interfaces in the configurator, making them easily manageable for subsequent processing. The choice of housing (top\/bottom) or insert (pin\/socket) is all that is necessary to begin the configuration process.\n\nAn on-screen 3D visualisation of the configuration, allows the design to be viewed from a range of angles. Each configuration is assigned its own number, allowing it to be saved for revision at a later date.\n\nChallenging as the industrial space can be, solutions and tools are on hand to aid engineers in their designs.\n\nNeil Tyler\n\nRelated Downloads\n\nComment on this article\n\nThis material is protected by MA Business copyright See Terms and Conditions.

        "text":"The Energy-Efficient Data Center\n\nWhen it comes to cutting customers' utility costs, it's solution providers that have the power\n\nPrinter-friendly version Email this CRN article\n\nGoogle is proud of its energy efficiency.\n\nAccording to the search and SaaS giant, its servers and data center support infrastructure consume on average about the same amount of energy as the servers of a typical data center alone. What's more, nearly half of the energy used by the typical data center is spent on systems that provide the power and cooling to servers, storage and related equipment, while the cost of Google's data center support equipment is less than 20 percent of its overall energy spend.\n\nLike any cloud-based service provider, energy is among Google's greatest expenses. So it's understandable that the company has always been energy-conscious. But recently it began sharing its data center best practices for lowering utility bills, and the company estimates that if all data centers were as efficient as Google's, the electricity savings in the U.S. alone would be enough to power \"every household within the city limits of Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C.\"\n\nHow does Google do it? Google discovered that data center infrastructure -- the power distribution units, battery backups and other data center gear -- wastes as much as 20 percent of the power it is in charge of providing. Further, as much as 70 percent of data center power is spent on keeping things cool. So these were the first areas targeted when Google developed its energy-efficiency plans. In short, it uses evaporative cooling towers to carry away heat at a fraction of the cost of chillers.\n\nMoreover, Google's custom-built servers were designed from the ground up to conserve energy. This is primarily accomplished in three ways: by using more efficient AC\/DC power converters and regulators than those in systems costing less; by running fans only as much as necessary to keep temperatures below certain thresholds; and by eliminating graphics chips and other components not necessary for Google applications.\n\nWith these changes, Google claims to have saved 500 kWh per server, or about $30 per box, per year when combined with savings related to water usage and carbon emission. Similar savings might be possible for many of your customers, particularly those maintaining large data centers. For the reseller, who is already looked upon as a trusted adviser, the energy audit is not only within your means and ability today, it's also a sure-fire way to lower your customers' utility bills.\n\nSo, say a call comes in to your IT department from a customer whose data center is running hot. Your IT manager says that the call is in sync with an e-mail received a few minutes before indicating that temperatures are above critical thresholds. Option 1: Send someone from your staff to the customer's site to take a look. Option 2: Point a browser to the data center's power distribution units to see if anything is out of the ordinary, cycling power as necessary.\n\nOption 2 is only available if you're using one of today's managed power distribution units (PDUs) from companies such as APC by Schneider Electric or Raritan. The CRN Test Center looked at offerings from both companies, and we present a review of the Raritan Dominion PX PDU as well as APC by Schneider Electric's Infrastruxure management software, both of which optimize energy usage through efficient management and reduce consumption by reducing wasted field trips. We'll also suggest some of the power-saving capabilities of Windows 7 that should be built into your standard deployment policies. Finally, we take a look at a new keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) extender from Icron Technologies.\n\nNEXT: Raritan Dominion PX\n\nRaritan Dominion PX\n\nThe aptly named Dominion line of PDUs from Raritan gives IT managers and MSPs authority over outlets in the data center. Absolute powers include the ability to turn on or off, cycle power or set thresholds for usage -- both high and low -- and to be notified by e-mail or SNMP event when reached or crossed.\n\nThe Dominion PX software also permits outlets and their users to be grouped for easy identification and policy setting and to aid in capacity planning. One or more PDUs can be controlled using a single IP address. A temperature and humidity sensor is included and can set off SNMP TRAPs, SETs and GETs to alert administrators of conditions that if corrected could avert actual power outages. For testing, Raritan sent CRN Test Center reviewers an eight-outlet DPXR8-15, which lists for $649. The sturdy unit set up in minutes and, backed by Raritan's solid channel program, is strongly recommended as a time- and energy-saver.\n\nNEXT: APC By Schneider Electric Infrastruxure\n\nAPC By Schneider Electric Infrastruxure\n\nThat's not a typo, Infrastruxure Central is the name of APC by Schneider Electric's power management software, and is a Test Center-recommended product that your energy-conscious customers may want to consider. Unlike Raritan's browser-based Dominion PX software, Infrastruxure is desktop software that presents a graphic representation of a blank data center, ready to populate with the customer's server, storage, power and cooling assets.\n\nThis centralized management tool simplifies planning of power distribution, hot- and cold-aisle isolation, monitors and reports power consumption and can send alerts when levels reach critical thresholds. Setting up a new server, electrical or storage room or infrastructure space is simply a matter of selecting \"New ...\" from the File menu, choosing the room type and shape, whether or not is has a raised floor, its carrying capacity and the size of its tiles. While in the Planning module, drag components from the predefined lists in the left-side pane to the right-side floor plan layout. Once racks, power and cooling units are in place, computing and storage equipment can be added to those racks. The software keeps track of power usage and capacities, and warns you if you've overloaded anything.\n\nOnce the data center is set up, the Operations module presents a multipaned window and point-and-click interface that enables quick visualization of components for moves, adds and changes to rack equipment and power distribution units. Right-clicking on individual components in a \"server room\" displays data about its power connection and consumption along with some general information and specifications about its location and configuration. Fields can be populated with any information the customer chooses.\n\nFrom the aerial view, double-clicking a rack, let's say, brings up an image of the front of that rack, complete with all installed components and free rack space. A reporting module also tracks this data, and can tell you how many \"U positions\" are available on all the racks in a specific data center, for example. Rack images are easily modified using drag-and-drop from a list of available components in the left-hand pane.\n\nThe panes at left display lists of installed racks in a device tree with their installed components, which can be drilled into for further details and dragged onto other racks or into other rooms. Another pane displays network information and power dependencies. Other modules provide services for planning the data center and analytics for inventory and power consumption reporting.\n\nHere's the best part for the energy-conscious customer: A Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) report (accessed through the Operations component) displays information about current and past power usage, providing administrators with an at-a-glance view of the amount of power being used by computing assets, infrastructure assets and the organization as a whole.\n\nThis dashboard, along with much other critical Infrastruxure data, can be accessed through a browser from any machine with connectivity to the LAN that manages the assets. Energy usage information -- even of subsystems such as UPSes, PDUs and cooling equipment -- is displayed, giving not only a complete picture of usage history, but also projections into the future and suggestions on ways to save.\n\nOther Infrastruxure capabilities include alarms and the consequences to IT that would result from component failure; automatic calculations for power, cooling and network port availability and capacities; detailed inventory reporting; work order tracking and management; complete audit trail reporting, including moves, adds and changes date, time and assignee.\n\nNot tested was Infrastruxure Mobile, an optional remote solution built around the Motorola MC70 Windows Mobile handheld computer with integrated bar-code reader. The device simplifies data center inventory and work order processing, and can help keep physical data in sync with its digital counterpart.\n\nAvailable in Basic, Standard and Enterprise editions, Infrastruxure Central is sold as a 1U or 2U appliance starting at around $3,500 list for management of 20 racks, 525 devices and 1,000 IT assets.\n\nNEXT: Windows 7 Power Policies\n\nWindows 7 Power Policies\n\nWindows 7 provides more user control over component power than any prior version. And beginning with Windows Vista, Microsoft permits solution providers to modify and extend these settings using Windows Group Policy. Resellers would be wise to recommend modifications to many of these settings in desktop energy audits and Windows 7 installations and can implement them easily using centralized deployment tools.\n\nAmong the most power-hungry components is the hard drive. Fortunately, Windows by default spins it down after 20 minutes of inactivity, so there's not much need to modify that policy. The next thing to consider is disabling power to any components that are not present in a system, such as wireless Ethernet adapters and PCI Express cards. These peripherals are both set to operate at maximum performance by default, unlike the USB bus, for which selective suspend is enabled at the factory.\n\nT... (truncated)",

        "text":"Storage smackdown: Hard drives vs. SSDs\n\nSolid state drives offer substantial benefits over traditional hard drives \u2013 they are faster, more reliable, use less energy and are quieter.\n\nOn the negative side, they have lifespans that are limited to an average number of writes per cell, and they can cost up to 70 times as much per gigabyte as standard hard drives.\n\nSo, where do SSDs fit in an enterprise network? In servers? In storage systems? Somewhere else?\n\nTo address those questions, we reviewed a variety of SSD-based products from seven vendors. Three of the products were Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) boards \u2013 an Adaptec MaxIQ 5805\/512 controller, two Apricorn PCIe Drive Arrays, and a FusionIO ioDrive.\n\nIn addition, we tested two SAN systems, a Compellent Storage Center 030, and a Dot Hill AssuredSAN 3730. Plus, we tested an HP BladeSystem c-class chassis with two server blades, each equipped with a 160GB StorageWorks IO accelerator module. And we looked at a Ritek 128GB SSD.\n\nFirst, some definitions: There are two types of SSDs \u2013 single-level cell (SLC) and multi-level cell (MLC). SLC drives are faster, have longer life spans (about 100,000 writes per cell) and cost more.\n\nMLC drives are less expensive, but have typical life spans of only about 10,000 writes per cell, making then generally inappropriate for write-intensive enterprise applications.\n\nMLC drives can have a place in the enterprise for read-intensive applications such as serving videos or database lookups. They can speed throughput and access times at a lower cost than SLC drives.\n\nSSDs are being used to replace standard hard drives in servers, but this is not typically the most effective way to use the drives. SLC-based SSDs are so much faster than standard hard drives that more than a couple of drives can overrun a standard storage controller.\n\nAlso, since SSDs typically are more reliable as well as more expensive than regular drives, using SSDs in a RAID configuration may not be the best use of the drives.\n\nThese issues are leading to new and different applications for SSDs. Some manufacturers are shipping PCI-X or PCIe boards that can either have SSDs (or discrete flash memory) directly mounted on them or attached via standard SAS or SATA cables.Other vendors have created appliances that are placed between servers and storage, operating as cache to speed up access to the storage without having to add SSDs to specific storage arrays.\n\nAnd some vendors have added SSDs to their existing SAN storage systems, either as cache or as another storage tier (often called tier 0).\n\nThis test covers all the categories of storage using SSDs except the appliances that sit between servers and storage. A number of vendors in that category were invited, including Atrato, Dataram, IBM, Schooner Information Technology, Solid Access Technologies, Storspeed, Teradata and Violin Memory, but none were able to get product to us in time for the review.\n\nOur test bed included an HP ML370G5 server running Windows Server 2003 with external storage connected via Fibre Channel through a 2Gbps HP FC switch. Storage performance was tested with IOmeter running a mix of tests intended to show overall improvements in throughput, IOps and latency.\n\nEach product was evaluated in the following areas: performance (throughput, IOps and latency), installation and documentation, ease of use, flexibility of configuration to suit differing network architectures, and price\/performance.\n\nWe found that performance gains with SSDs were dramatic, with anywhere from double to 10 times the performance of hard-drive based systems. The two Fibre Channel arrays, from Compellent and Dot Hill, were limited only by the 2Gbps Fibre Channel interface and would have shown higher numbers with a 4Gbps or 8Gbps host bus adapter.\n\nInternal storage has an advantage, as the PCI bus can sustain higher throughput and IOps than some external interfaces. With read and write throughput exceeding 700MBps, the fastest of these systems can shatter bottlenecks.\n\nThe 'write cliff' effect\n\nOne issue emerged during our testing that highlights a key difference between high-performance SSDs and consumer-grade ones. The consumer grade drives (the Adaptec, Apricorn, Dot Hill and Ritek systems) showed dramatic variations in response times (latency) under sustained write conditions, which some vendors are calling the 'write cliff'.\n\nWhile performance numbers with the other systems remained constant from the beginning to the end of the test, the consumer-grade drives showed drop-offs in performance once the drive was filled for the first time and the drive's internal garbage collection and wear-leveling routines kicked in.\n\nThis only affects write performance \u2013 read performance is unchanged even with the consumer-grade drives.\n\nThese variations in response times were most marked with the single MLC-based Ritek drive and the Apricorn MLC-based array. But the other three (the Adaptec, Apricorn SLC-based array and DotHill system) showed the effect as well, with latencies varying from less than one millisecond to more than a second with the latter, and over 3 seconds with the first two.In contrast, the Compellent, FusionIO and HP systems remained under 12 milliseconds even under extended sessions of 100% writes.\n\nThe enterprise drives don't have this issue because of over-provisioning \u2013 a drive labeled as 146GB may actually have a capacity of 300GB. Some of the systems also have optimized wear-leveling algorithms that only move data around when the drives are not being heavily utilized.\n\nThe trade-off is that the enterprise drives are also more expensive \u2013 while the Ritek 128GB drive has an MSRP of $400, the FusionIO modules are $6,829.99 for a 320GB unit, and Compellent 146GB drives are $11,000 each, with a minimum of three required.\n\nThe best bargain may be the Adaptec 5805 controller with the MaxIQ package \u2013 it accelerates any internal storage in the system, not merely drives connected to the controller. While it was subject to the \"write cliff,\" adding more than one 64GB SLC SSD should help with this, and the cost for the system is quite low, at $645 for the controller and $1,295 for a single drive MaxIQ package.\n\nIf you have a write-intensive application like a database, you'll want to look at something like the Compellent array, or the FusionIO and HP system cards, which offer very high performance, though at high prices.\n\nIf you're looking for high performance in applications that are read-intensive or don't require extended writes, any of the drives will perform better than most hard drives, and some of the solutions are quite inexpensive.\n\n\nSSDs can produce higher performance than standard hard drives, though you will need to choose carefully to ensure that the SSDs you pick are matched to your application.\n\nApplications that write large amounts of data over extended periods of time will need write-optimized SSDs, which are more expensive than consumer-grade drives. All of the products we tested offered substantial benefits over standard hard drives, though also at higher prices.\n\nHarbaugh is a freelance reviewer and IT consultant in Redding, Calif.

        "text":"\nWant CNET to notify you of price drops and the latest stories?\nNo, thank you\n\nReview: iPad Mini is back and Apple's 2019 update offers new mojo for small tablets\n\nThere are a lot of iPads now, but can the smallest one spark a little joy?\n\nAngela Lang\/CNET\n\nI remember when I met the iPad Mini. It was back in 2012, when I first moved to New Jersey and began my routine of hour-long commutes into Manhattan. I loved that it was small, but not too small.\n\nIt was my favorite iPad.\n\nI now carry a lot of gear on that same train ride: A Nintendo Switch, a Kindle Paperwhite, my phone, a larger iPad and maybe a laptop. There's plenty of redundancy in my life. But it's also where we are as a culture. Busy people with their faces buried in many purpose-built portable gadgets.\n\nThe iPad Mini now lives in a land of 6-inch phones and tons of tablets, Chromebooks and convertible tablet PCs. It's another tool in the bag. Maybe I have gadget clutter. Maybe the new 7.9-inch Mini\u00a0-- starting at $399 (\u00a3399, AU$599) and available to order now -- could help Kondo things up a bit.\n\nBut here's the thing: The new iPad Mini is an incremental product update, a spec bump to a tablet that otherwise looks the same as the model from 2015. Does that spark joy? After using it for a few days... it's fine. But it's not something you need. In fact, if you have an old iPad Mini 4, you're good. Lifestyle clutter problem solved. (You're welcome.)\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Who is the new iPad Mini for, exactly?\n\nBut if you want an iPad Mini and have been waiting for a good up-to-date version, it's here: The Mini now has an A12 processor and Pencil support. I've been using one here in San Francisco while attending the Game Developers Conference, where I've been running around trying on\u00a0VR and AR headsets\u00a0and taking notes like a maniac.\n\nIs this a device you need? I don't. My phone takes notes. I jot ideas and watch movies on a larger iPad. The size of the Mini still feels really nice, but its nonupdated design -- same form, same bezels, same everything -- feels ancient compared to the future-bending foldable phone-to-tablet ideas arriving imminently. Foldables will cost a fortune, but they blow up the idea of even carrying two different gadgets.\n\nMaybe the iPad Mini is a hold-the-fort update, a spec bump to last until Apple reinvents its product lineup again. If you want to know more, read on.\n\n\nPencil support: Nice to have.\n\nAngela Lang\/CNET\n\nYes, it's fast\n\nIts A12 processor won't end up being as fast as the iPad Pro's A12X, though. Early Geekbench 4 benchmarks show a single core score of 4,810, and a multicore score of 11,559, which is basically the same speed as the iPhone XS. Meanwhile the 11-inch iPad Pro's A12X processor gets benchmarks that are somewhat faster in single-core and significantly faster in multicore. Multitasking, for the apps I've tried so far, seems to be a lot better than the iPad Mini 4 could handle, so no surprise there.\n\nPencil support is nice to have (and the Logitech Crayon too)\n\nThe iPad Mini doesn't work with the new Apple Pencil, but it can connect with the original Pencil and it works just as well as on last year's 9.7-inch iPad. It also supports Logitech's cute little Pencil alternative, the Crayon. Sketching is fun, but I'm not an artist. One problem with the Mini is that the smaller 7.9-inch screen has less real estate. The larger bezel removes a chunk of possible work area. And there's no place to store that Pencil, so you'll want a case that slots a Pencil holder in.\n\n\nThe Pencil charges via the Lightning port. But don't ever hold your iPad up via your Pencil like this.\n\nAngela Lang\/CNET\n\nTouch ID and a headphone jack are still there (which I prefer)\n\nI'm happy that the Mini lacks Face ID, and still works with headphones. Most people, I bet, will agree. The only downside here is that it has a ton of bezel at the top and bottom, which makes movies feel pretty hemmed-in and small.\u00a0\n\nIt's crazy small compared to other iPads...\u00a0\n\nIt's bigger than my Kindle, but it's easy to use one-handed and carry around like a book. For casual travel and reading, or anyone who needs one for on-the-go work, it's a solid middle-ground screen.\n\n\niPhone XS, iPad Mini, 11-inch iPad Pro. Note the bezel.\n\nAngela Lang\/CNET\n\n...But that bezel.\u00a0\n\nThe extra space on the top and bottom of the iPad Mini aren't aging well. It could easily be used for more screen space. Against the latest iPhones and the fancier iPad Pros, it feels glaring. But if Apple had added Face ID and increased the screen-to-body ratio, then the Mini might be even more expensive.\n\nThis isn't for little kids... or is it?\u00a0\n\nI mean, you could buy your little kid an iPad Mini for $399, but I wouldn't. That price (or $529 for the 256GB model) sets it out of range for a lot of parents. It's a shame, because the iPad Mini is otherwise a perfect tablet for children. The $329 9.7-inch iPad (which is often on sale for even less) isn't entirely a better bet, since it has less storage (32GB) and an older processor. But at least it's less expensive.\u00a0\n\nIf only this had a mini Pencil, too\n\nThe first-gen Pencil is still good, but it's big, and almost dwarfs the Mini. The Logitech Crayon is a little more compact, and works with the Mini, too. But it would be nice to have a smaller, custom-designed stylus instead.\n\nAngela Lang\/CNET\n\nI'd get the iPad Air instead, or the entry-level iPad\n\nI prefer typing on iPads with a connected keyboard case, which becomes tougher (but not impossible) on the Mini. The 9.7-inch $329 iPad has plenty of great keyboard options. So does the new iPad Air, which is basically the 2017 10.5-inch iPad Pro with an A12 processor and no 120Hz ProMotion in the display. The Air is an extra $100, but its extra screen size and smart connector seem worth it. But I don't have the new iPad Air to review yet, so I can't compare.\n\nYou know what this is, and whether you want it\n\nAn iPad Mini with a faster processor and Pencil support is filling a specific need not everyone will have. It's like a specifically sized screw, or a particular TV size. As Apple keeps splitting its iPad line into more variants, the Mini feels far less essential than ever, particularly as the iPhone screens creep to 6 inches or more. But if you need an efficient iPad this size and don't want a bigger iPhone for the job, well, this is what you're looking for.\n\nA missed opportunity\n\nIt would be nice if Apple had reconceived the design of the iPad Mini and the Pencil to be even better at maximizing its size and function. Is this a notepad or something more? Could it aspire to be as versatile as a Surface Go, or push further to be a perfect little full-screen device? The Mini is a spec-bumped tablet, rather than a truly reimagined product.\n\nAnd that's the thing: It's fiiiine.\u00a0But unlike the iPhone SE, which managed to be both throwback and fun, or the Retina return of the MacBook Air, the Mini doesn't feel quite as triumphant in the sea of other Apple-made alternatives.\u00a0\n\nI guess in the end, what I'm saying is it didn't spark joy.",

This is just the right thing if you just want to fill up your stomach after a long day at work without getting into debt or risking food poisoning. It is a safe bet. However, it is because of such a run-of-the-mill delivery service (note: it might be a poor analogy) in the form of\u00a0the Oppo A91 that makes us think it is great! This smartphone comes with just about enough of everything in terms of hardware, and will be able to deal with all that you throw at it.\u00a0In this review, we'll tell you what we liked about the Oppo A91 and the 'leftovers' which remain.\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Solid overall package\n  \u2022 Convincing camera with important basic functions\n  \u2022 Solid hardware with 8 GB of RAM\n  \u2022 Good fast charging capability\n  \u2022 Beautiful AMOLED display\n\n\n  \u2022 Runs on Android 9\n  \u2022 Poor low-light camera performance\n  \u2022 Low brightness display\n  \u2022 No protection against water and dust\n  \u2022 Sluggish fingerprint sensor performance\n\nFor whom is the Oppo A91 worthwhile?\n\nThis brief introduction covers the Oppo A91 target market adequately. I will recommend the handset to anyone who is currently in the market to pick up a smartphone without having to think too much into the matter. Without any protruding selfie cameras, no implementation of water cooling for improved performance, and ostentatious zoom levels to capture details of a full moon on a clear night, is this your quintessential mid-range smartphone? For a \"street price\" of \u20ac250 ($295), you will end up with a functional smartphone for the average Joe.\n\nFor our review, Oppo sent us the A91 with 8 GB of RAM. Since this version is available on the Internet at a lower price compared to the 4 GB of RAM variant, we definitely recommend the reviewed unit.\n\n\nOppo A91: What I liked about it\n\nCamera with useful functions\n\nWithout great expectations, I went for a little photo walk with the Oppo A91 and was positively surprised. This is because the quad-camera setup at the rear delivers good results almost through the entire photo walk. Armed with its 48-megapixel main camera and the ultra-wide-angle camera that delivers 8-megapixels of resolution, it covers a focal length range from ultra-wide-angle (119 degrees field-of-vision) to wide-angle (26 millimeters). In order to achieve this, Oppo included another camera for depth detection and a fourth lens with a monochrome sensor at the back. The monochrome camera cannot be controlled separately in Oppo's camera app, which makes it pretty much useless when taking pictures.\n\nOppo a91 kamera test\nWithout HDR mode the dynamic range is good (left). The HDR mode (right) makes the images look quite fake. \/ \u00a9 NextPit\n\nHowever, it could very well be that the Oppo A91 is able to perform post-processing of its images so well through the implementation of computational photography and artificial intelligence. This is especially true when taking the results of the main camera into consideration: they really are good looking and include a lot of details alongside a good dynamic range. For my taste, the HDR mode works a bit too aggressively, but it can be switched off permanently easily. Shooting in ultra-wide-angle mode with its resolution of 8-megapixels, there is\u00a0still has enough sharpness and can be used without any worry. You should keep your hands off all other zoom levels on the Oppo A91 though. While I can almost still tolerate the 2x digital magnification, I wanted to delete pictures taken with 5x zoom as quickly as possible. It is only because of our readers that I have kept and included them in this test.\n\nYou can view all our test images in full resolution here: Oppo A91 test photos\n\nPortrait shots look natural and have a precise and good bokeh, i.e. a blurred background, thanks to the depth sensor. For photography in the dark, Oppo gives the smartphone its own night mode, which actually saves many colors from dark situations. For really good results, there are still too many megapixels on the small main sensor and the pictures are too noisy. The final results are bright, but they are hardly convincing with their low level of detail.\n\noppo a91 selfie kamera\nThe front camera delivers good results and offers a software-based blur effect. The digital bokeh is quite decent. Portrait pictures with the main camera are detailed and look good. \/ \u00a9 NextPit\n\nAMOLED display\n\nThe display of the Oppo A91 measures a whopping 6.4-inches and thanks to the discreet waterdrop notch, there is a whole lot of screen to work with. The bezels are virtually non-existent, providing you with the great feeling of holding only one large screen in your hand. This effect is\u00a0especially true when watching videos. Due to the slim 20:9 format, the phone fits well in the hand and with a resolution of 1,080 x 2,400 pixels, it is also sufficiently sharp.\n\nAndroidPIT Oppo A91 front camera selfie\nThe Oppo A91 comes with a teardrop notch. \/ \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nTypical for a display with AMOLED technology, the contrast of the Oppo A91 is virtually infinite. Black areas on the display are therefore particularly dark and I also like the other color renditions very much. The colors are not too bright, as is often the case with Samsung smartphones. Rather, the Oppo A91's display looks natural and can be set to either colder or warmer hues if you don't like it.\n\nNo wonder the A91's display is so good at refresh rate and brightness. Spoiled by the more expensive Oppo Find X2 Neo, which offers a refresh rate of 90 Hertz, lists and animations on the Oppo A91 at 60 Hertz are a little jerky. This is completely normal in smartphones that reside within the sub-\u20ac300 ($354) price range. The low brightness is disappointing in reality. Under bright sunlight, it wasn't always easy for me to recognize menus and apps on the display.\n\nQuick charge function\n\nThe battery of the Oppo A91 offers a good average capacity of 4,025 mAh. When it whittles down to nothing,\u00a0it can be quickly charged thanks to VOOC 3.0. The manufacturer's quick charge technology works with 20 watts of power, and according to the manufacturer, it is capable of hitting 50% charge within half an hour.\n\nWe can confirm the reliability of this claim through our review. In just over half an hour, the battery life increased from 45 percent to 100 percent using the included charger. This is perfect as you can easily recharge it during a quick meal at a restaurant or while you are on a train ride. The Oppo A91 does not support wireless charging though, but the contactless transmission standard NFC has been integrated.\n\nOppo A91: What I didn't like too much\n\nSlow system performance\n\nIf you choose a handset\u00a0from the mid-range smartphone pool, you usually don't expect top performance. Compared to many entry-level smartphones, however, these handsets happen to be rather convincing in terms of system performance. After all, you will be able to enjoy mobile games at smooth frame rates\u00a0at low or medium quality levels. With these experiences in mind, I was a bit disappointed with the performance of the Oppo A91 at first.\n\nLaggy menus and long loading times made me cry as I tested out Call of Duty: Mobile\u00a0which\u00a0took a surprisingly short amount of time to install. Another pleasant surprise: the mobile game ran smoothly and even looked quite nice when it was set to the medium graphics level. So why does the system performance of the A91 leave a lot to be desired?\n\nAt a glance, the specifications sheet did not answer this question. The Mediatek MT6771V Helio P70 processor is even one of the faster pieces of silicon in the mid-range market and armed with 8 GM of RAM, Oppo also provides the SoC with enough system memory. Reaching deep into the Android box of tricks and disabling\u00a0animations in the developer settings, lo and behold: the operating system seems to be the culprit for the slow performance.\n\nAndroidPIT Oppo A91 back logo\nThe Oppo A91 does not provide protection against dust and water. \/ \u00a9 AndroidPIT\n\nCurrently runs on Android 9\n\nThis is probably the biggest flaw of the Oppo A91 right from the get-go. Despite the latest updates, the smartphone runs on Android 9 and thus with the second latest version of Google's mobile operating system. Since the Oppo smartphone has already been released in India in 2019, it is safe to say that an update is somewhat overdue. Apparently, Oppo sees it the same way.\n\nAs if the smartphone had been listening during the review, Oppo announced in the Color OS Forum during the review that it would continue with the distribution of Android 10 for the Oppo A91. Specifically, this is Oppo's operating system \"Color OS 7\", which works with a stable version of Android 10. Users from countries like India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Russia can already register for the upgrade. German users will have to wait, but it looks good for an update soon.\n\nLame fingerprint sensor\n\nFor the biometric verification of its owner, the Oppo A91 has an in-display fingerprint sensor and offers face\u00a0recognition as an alternative. In practice, the latter works much faster than the in-display sensor. This is the case because the handset makes sure that your finger is lying on the screen before it gets to work. The sensor will deny you access to the smartphone if your finger is\u00a0lying at an angle or at a slight tilt.\n\nThe face recognition of the Oppo A91 is much faster. During my review, I activated both systems in parallel and usually the front camera recognized me before my finger unlocked the phone. When unlocking by face, however, the feedback is too subtle to notice. Only a small lock symbol informs you visually that the phone can now be unlocked with an upward swipe. Here, I would have liked a short notification via haptic feedback. If you buy the Oppo A91, we recommend that you turn on direct unlocking by face in the setting... (truncated)",

        "text":"Digital Cameras Guide\n\nPanasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 review\n\nLiving Up to the Micro Four Thirds Promise - Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1\n\nCompare This\n\nDesign & Handling Part 1\n\nDesign & Handling Part 1\n\n\nThe GF1's product design doesn't leave too much of an impression in black, although the white and red versions look much more fashionable. Otherwise, everything feels utilitarian, with form following function.\n\n\nThe GF1 and the E-P1 both occupy a new middle-ground between DSLR and prosumer camera models; they are smaller than a DSLR but larger than prosumer cameras like the Panasonic LX3 and the Canon G10. If you've been a keen compact user, you'll feel the GF1's 285 grams weight and its larger-than-compact size, but if you're a DSLR user, you'll appreciate the smaller size it occupies in your bag.\n\nThe camera body feels dense and compact, but its weight is evenly distributed throughout the body. Even though it's heavier than a compact, you can easily shoot one-handed with the GF1.\n\nWith one exception, the controls on the GF1 are all well placed and make using the GF1 an intuitive experience.\n\nThe Mode Dial on top toggles between different shooting modes. An Off\/On switch, easily differentiated by touch from the shutter release button, is in the right place, as is a handy video recording button just beside the shutter release. Without switching to video mode, you can simply depress this button to start shooting video immediately.\n\nAll the controls on the back are easily accessible and buttons are just the right size. The double-function shutter dial - which we loved in the Panasonic G1 and the GH1 - is back. Scrolling it normally controls either the shutter or aperture settings depending on which priority mode you're in. But go into manual, and pressing the dial down like a button switches between shutter and aperture control.\n\nThe one little annoyance we have with the GF1's controls is that the shooting mode switch is right below the mode dial. While that may be convenient, its closeness to the mode dial means that it sometimes gets brushed and changed accidentally.",

\u00a0After all, you\u2019re giving up a lot of programs you\u2019ve probably been using for years (Outlook, Word). \u00a0You\u2019re giving up all these things too:\n\n  \u2022 system optimization tools\n  \u2022 drivers for your old hardware (printers etc)\n  \u2022 file manager\n  \u2022 anti virus software\n\nSome liken\u00a0the experience of using a Chromebook to that of running a browser with a keyboard\u2026and they\u2019re right because that\u2019s really all you\u2019re doing. \u00a0And that browser is Chrome. \u00a0No other browser is allowed. \u00a0In fact, installation of\u00a0any\u00a0\u00a0software is meant to be totally impossible (of course there are hobbyists who tinker with their Chromebooks).\n\nSo again:\u00a0why buy a laptop that amounts to little more than the Chrome browser with a keyboard?\n\nOne reason is that Chromebooks are pretty much virus-proof. \u00a0The \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of this seemingly impossible idea is explained below.\n\nWhy you should love the idea of Chromebook: it\u2019s more virus-proof than anything we\u2019ve ever seen\n\nYou may think Google\u2019s motive for developing a laptop that forced users to use Google\u2019s cloud-based storage (which doesn\u2019t come free, after all), Google\u2019s browser, and Google\u2019s app store was clear. \u00a0And yes, we grumble at the thought of being tethered to Google world forever, should we choose to purchase a Chromebook.\n\nBut for anyone who\u2019s ever sat through endless Windows updates and the issues that come along with them, plus anyone who\u2019s ever dealt with a virus, or paid for anti-virus software\u2026well there\u2019s a another clear advantage of owning a Chromebook it\u2019s said to be virus-free.\n\nThe virus-proof factor is a huge draw, but can it really be true? \u00a0Can a laptop really be virus-proof?\n\nHow \u201cVirus-Proof\u201d works\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s how the Chromebook functions, and how it can be virus-free, in theory:\n\nViruses like to be installed on your operating system or in software,\u00a0both of which\u00a0reside on your computer. \u00a0Chromebooks work via web-based apps rather than natively installed software, so that takes care of that. \u00a0As for the OS, it\u2019s not writable so there\u2019s really no way for a virus to take hold there, either.\n\nChromebooks are designed to be\u00a0used, not maintained. \u00a0No software installs, no software updates, no Windows updates, no anti-virus software\u2026no disk cleanup, defragging, or other maintenance issues whatsoever. \u00a0Even the OS takes care of its own updates\u2026the user doesn\u2019t even know they\u2019re happening and certainly doesn\u2019t have to enter any passwords to make them happen.\n\nYou see, Chromebooks actually operates a double version of the operating system. \u00a0There are two copies, only one of which gets updated at a time. \u00a0If an update fails (you\u2019ve seen it with Windows countless times), that version of the OS won\u2019t be allowed to run on the laptop. \u00a0The OS which is currently being used by the owner is totally non-writable. \u00a0Only the copy that\u2019s\u00a0not\u00a0being used is writable, for updates.\n\nSo to answer the question of the day:\u00a0yes, it\u2019s possible for the Chromebook to pretty much virus-proof. \u00a0You just have to give up the old way of personal computing and move on over to the Cloud. \u00a0Google\u2019s cloud, to be exact. After all,\u00a0The Laptop is The New\u00a0Factory!",
