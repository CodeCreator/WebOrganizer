The story of Mary\u2019s childhood as given in the Protevangelium has no parallel in the New Testament, and reference to a nine-year stay in the Temple of Jerusalem contradicts Jewish customs. Mary\u2019s birth to aged parents is termed miraculous, and after the birth of Jesus a midwife is said to have confirmed that Mary was still a virgin.

Instead, I have engaged in a four-year task of translating Dante's Divine Comedy.\"\n\nPublished this week is a new Sayers book that lies somewhere between the two.

Traveling together isn\u2019t always easy, but the ark saves us from drowning. And it does more than that\u2014it gives us a space where we can learn to live together.\n\nThe new monastic community my family is part of has provided a space for Christians of different traditions to learn to live together. Our group of Baptists, Pentecostals, Methodists, Episcopalians and Catholics has found a way to live together as a community of Christians who want to care for one another and for our neighbors around us (we\u2019ve done this while remaining members of our denominational churches).\n\n\nThis article is available to subscribers only.
