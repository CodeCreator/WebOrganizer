I would guess you even have some visual images of him from paintings, magazines, and so on. (All of which wrong, didn\u2019t you know?) But I\u2019m not really talking about visual impressions, I\u2019m talking about your ideas of his character, his personality, what he was like. You pick these up along the way from many, many sources.\n\nAnd all these sources come together to form a Jesus of the imagination\u2014something you have put together in your own mind as a model. And then when you sit down with a Bible, and you actually read the Gospel accounts, your imaginary Jesus is going to encounter the real man, and some adjustments are surely going to have to take place. Because, every once in a while, Jesus would do something that, to people standing by and observing, seemed out of character. Sometimes it even seemed downright offensive.\n\nThere is one incident like this that is recorded by Matthew. Jesus has been trying to get away from the crowds. He goes away into the desert and winds up having to feed the 5,000-plus people who followed him out there. Since that didn\u2019t work he tries leaving the country and goes off to the seacoast around Tyre and Sidon. His encounter with a woman of this region can seem rude and dismissive, but reveals a great lesson in faith. We\u2019ll find this meeting in Matthew, chapter 15.\n\nSeries Navigation<< The Gospel of Matthew #25The Gospel of Matthew #27 >>\n\nRonald L. Dart\n\nRonald L. Dart\n\nRonald L.

Sometimes when I am out speaking, especially to a predominantly Baptist group, I will play a little trick on my audience. I will get them to raise their hands by asking a question, ''How many of you are Baptist?'' As they raise their hand I will quickly add, ''who are backslidden?''\n\n2. Now that never fails to get a laugh because most people who raise their hands do not really believe they are backslidden at all, even though they very well be. You see, we tend to think that a backslider is someone who is living in unconcerned, unconfessed, unconcealed sin, and obviously needs to get right with God. But if the truth were known and told, far more of us are backslidden than we would like to admit.\n\n3. Consider this statement: If you find yourself loving any pleasure more than your prayers; any book better than the Bible; any house better than the House of God; any person better than the Lord Jesus Christ; or any place on earth better than your home in heaven, you are backslidden.\n\n4. If there has ever been a time when you loved Jesus more than you love Him now; a time when you were more excited about God than you are right now; a time when you were close to the Lord than you are right now, you are backslidden. If you are not as close to God as you have been at some time in the past, it is your fault, for ''if you draw near to God, God will draw near to you.''\n\n5. I remember the story about a farmer and his wife who were driving to town in their pickup truck. The farmer was sitting behind the wheel in silence. His wife was sitting over against the door, as far from her husband as she could get. After several miles she said, ''You know, when we were first married we didn't sit this far apart.''\n\n6. Her husband simply replied, ''I ain't the one that moved.'' If you are not as close to God as you once were, guess who moved.\n\n7. Do you know what a Christian has to do to backsli ...\n\nThere are 19013 characters in the full content.

        "text":"Acts 4 (sermon audio: Sunday a.m.)\n\nRecycling, in its modern sense, is the idea of taking our trash and useless items to someone who processes it down and creates something useful again from that same material. But, what if we were talking about your life, your hurts, your pain? Is it possible that our struggles, in the hand of God, could be re-created into something of worth? Acts 4 explores this idea of God taking our circumstances and making them valuable for His glory.\n\nListen to Audio\n\n\nPopular Posts",
