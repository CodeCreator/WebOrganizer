        "text":"Fonolo Receives Patents for Contact Center Technology\n\nFonolo has been granted two U.S. patents related to its call-back technology. The company now has a portfolio of seven U.S. patents and two Canadian patents, with more applications pending.\n\nU.S. Patent 9,014,351, entitled \"System and Method for Deep Dialing Phone Systems,\" relates to automated methods that can allow independent systems to map out and interact with the call center of another company, using that company's IVR as the interface.\n\nU.S. Patent 9,031,214, entitled \"System and Method of Use for Indexing Automated Phone Systems,\" covers techniques for connecting customers with agents at call centers, the use of statistics to compare the expected remaining time before a human operator will answer, and initiate a call to minimize the wait time.\n\n\"Through these patents and the others in our portfolio, we have demonstrated industry leadership in three areas that are key to the future of the contact center: Virtual queuing (allows a caller to wait in line for an agent without being on hold), IVR integration (enables novel interactions with legacy call centers), and callback technology (the only universal way to escalate from a non-voice channel to an agent conversation),\" said Masoud Vakili, senior advisor for IP strategy at Fonolo, in a statement.\n\n\"These new patents are part of Fonolo's active strategy to build a strong intellectual property portfolio and to bring innovative, proprietary call-back technologies to the market,\" said Fonolo CEO Shai Berger in a statement. \"The importance of call-backs has surged in recent years because of increasingly diverse channels that companies are using for customer service. As the pioneer of cloud-based call-back solutions, our mission is to make it possible for companies of all sizes to add these capabilities to their contact center in order to expand their customer service offerings and improve call center efficiency.\"",

However, shareholders may be disappointed with the price, which is nearly $500m less than Countrywide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value on Thursday. Because it is an all-stock transaction, Countrywide's investors will benefit if BofA stock rises.\n\n    For BofA, buying Countrywide is a bet that it can salvage its $2bn investment in a preferred stock issued by the company in August - BofA paid $18 a share for a 16% stake.\n\n  \u2022 The Wall Street Journal\n\n    BofA, which has more than $100bn in its own home-equity loans, would be taking on another $32.5bn in Countrywide home-equity loans. Though Countrywide has virtually stopped making sub-prime loans, it has exposure to its past originations. As of September 30, Countrywide's savings bank held $26.8bn of option adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\n  \u2022 New York Post\n\n    BofA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anticipated proposal to rescue Countrywide would also come as a relief to federal regulators.\n\n    By purchasing Countrywide, BofA would prevent the largest US mortgage lender from filing for bankruptcy and thereby avert significant damage to the home-loan market - a mess the US Federal Reserve and other agencies desperately want to avoid, analysts said, and one that poses far greater risks to the economy than mortgage industry consolidation.\n\nEmail this article to a friend\n\nPlease enter the recipients email address for who you wish to send this article to.\n\n\nOther press digests in this section",

Alan Howard of Brevan Howard Asset Management and Mike Platt of BlueCrest Capital Management are both worth 1.5 billion pounds, according to the Sunday Times. Alan Howard was in first place last year, but he lost around 100,000 pounds as his fund had a tough year, allowing Platt to pull up into a tie with him for the richest hedge fund manager in the UK.\n\nIn general, 2014 was a very good year for hedge fund managers, as Howard was the only manager in the top 20 to see his wealth shrink.\n\nBrevan Howard saw tough sledding in 2014\n\n2014 was a difficult year for Brevan Howard Asset Management. The firm\u2019s flagship macro hedge fund posted its first-ever calendar year loss and the commodities fund was shut down and funds returned to investors. Moreover, it was reported yesterday that three partners have left the firm within the last month.\n\nMore on 2015 Sunday Times Rich List\n\nMike Platt, the co-founder of BlueCrest Capital Management, had his ups and downs last year, but his wealth remained basically unchanged in 2014 at \u00a31.5 billion. However, things might not be so rosy this year, as the BlueCrest Capital International hedge fund is down 5.4% so far in 2015, according to a knowledgeable source.\n\nOf note, the fastest climbers up this year\u2019s Rich List were husband and wife Crispin Odey and Nicola Pease, whose net worth soared \u00a3580 million to \u00a31.1 billion in 2014. The Rich List pointed to the success of Odey Asset Management as the source of the new cash, as the hedge fund firm profits were up 300% last year.\n\nIncluding the power couple and offering proof that the rich really do often get richer, there were seven billionaire entries on the list this year, up from just four billionaires a year ago.\n\nAlso joining the billionaire club this year was David Harding, the founder of Winton Capital Management, who saw 30% gains last year to top \u00a31 billion in net worth.",

Parsons and AOL founder Steve Case, seeking information about the booking of $400 million in revenue from dealings with German media company Bertelsmann AG after the 2001 merger of AOL and Time Warner, the Washington Post reported.\n\nThe subpoenas, reported by the New York Times, do not accuse the recipients of wrongdoing. Rather the government appears to be on a fact-finding mission. AOL\u2019s third quarter filing, which shows a drop of 688,000 subscribers for the period, acknowledges the ongoing probe into the Bertelsmann situation. In addition, the filing showed a drop off in AOL advertising revenue, to $178 million in the third quarter, down 33 percent from a year ago.\n\n\"In July 2003, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC informed the Company that it has concluded that the accounting for these transactions is incorrect,\" Time Warner disclosed in its filing. \"In addition, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC continues to investigate the facts and circumstances of the negotiation and performance of these agreements with Bertelsmann, including the value of advertising.\"\n\n\"The SEC staff also continues to investigate a range of other transactions principally involving the Company's America Online unit, including all advertising arrangements and the methods used by the America Online unit to report its subscriber numbers.

        "text":"Starting a business on the right note\n\nKelly Buss has a new licensed in-home care business, and she's using music to market it.\n\nKelly Buss gives a musical performance at Reading Elderly Housing as whe works to promote her new in-home care business.\nKelly Buss' ability to carry a tune may help carry her into the crowded market for in-home care providers.\n\nIn December, Buss gave a free vocal performance of Christmas music - her numbers included \"The Little Drummer Boy\" and \"The First Noel\" - to about 20 residents at Reading Elderly Housing on North Front Street. They applauded, sang along and, afterward, praised Buss' voice.\n\n\"They loved it,\" said Tania Evans, social services coordinator.\n\nBuss, who lives in Maidencreek Township, recently started her own in-home care business, Family Matters Home Care Ltd. A mother of three grown children, she previously worked for another in-home care agency.\n\nAfter being promoted twice, she became dissatisfied with her employer's approach.\n\nLongtime friend Jennifer Freeze, a Caron Treatment Centers office manager who moved from Berks County to Texas several years ago, said Buss has an excellent chance of success on her own.\n\n\"She is a very passionate person,\" Freeze said. \"Helping people is one of her passions.\"\n\nAnother is singing. Buss was in the chorus and was named a Hempfield Singer, a distinguished position for vocalists, at her alma mater, Hempfield High School in Lancaster County.\n\nShe has sung at weddings and has been known to do some karaoke during outings with friends and family. The concept of giving free singing performances as she spread the word about her business seemed like a natural.\n\n\"Mostly it was thinking that if this is the people you are going to pull from, you should show you are willing to give something,\" Buss said. \"It is me giving back to the community that I want to work in.\"\n\nA recent free performance at the Mennonite Home in Lancaster County was broadcast on the home's in-house television channel. And Evans said that at the 201-unit, 16-floor Reading Elderly Housing complex, free performers are always appreciated.\n\nGaining clients for a new in-home care business is not guaranteed.\n\nStatistics provided by the state Department of Health show there are 1,498 licensed home care agencies - those limited to nonmedical care - in Pennsylvania. Beyond that, many unlicensed individuals also provide in-home care.\n\n\"I think it is extremely tough competition, from the business side of it,\" said Buss' husband of 23 years, Glenn, a business owner himself. \"There are a lot of players in it. There are big businesses in it.\"\n\nGlenn Buss helped Kelly set up Family Matters. He said his wife spent thousands of dollars to secure insurance and paid about $500 for initial fees and state licensing.\n\nShe had to submit to background checks and the prospect of regular state audits.\n\nThey never seriously considered skipping the license.\n\n\"There are a lot of things you have to do that are consumer protection things, associated with the license,\" he said. \"If you do it on your own, it is very unregulated and very vague as to who is responsible for what.\"\n\nGlenn Buss has operated Maidencreek Marine and RV Sales and Service in Richmond Township for 24 years. He has eight employees.\n\nWhen he set out, he said, business was far from a sure thing.\n\n\"I had distributors tell me I was out of my mind for starting this here, because this area was so packed with competition,\" he said.\n\nLikewise, he said, his wife's approach to business is built on the pleasure she gets in caring for people, not just a quest for profit.\n\n\"People recognize legitimacy,\" he said. \"People recognize that you are doing it for the right reasons.\"\n\nContact Ford Turner: 610-371-5037 or\n\nPurchase Daily Photos",

Gold prices have surged 3.8% since last Thursday, boosted by the initial market optimism towards the EU Summit's conclusions.\n\nHaving jumped 3.38% since last Thursday, the S&P500 was down 0.47% on Thursday, while the Stoxx50 retraced 1.53%, after having surged 7.54% since last Thursday.\n\nThe Euro\/Dollar fell to 1.2384 as of Friday morning in Asia, giving up all of its gains since the announcements at the EU Summit on 29 June, while the Dollar Index is now at 82.836, back to the level on 28 June.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index rebounded while the Euro\/Dollar sold off. The U.S. unemployment claims fell 14,000 last week to 374,000, and the private employers added 176,000 jobs, while the ECB cut rates by 25bp on Thursday, supported by the worsening economic contraction in Europe.\n\nPrior to the ECB announcement, China also cut its lending rates by 31bp and the deposit rates by 25bp, in order to stimulate lending growth, and to keep its economic recovery on track in 2H 2012.\n\nThe Bank of England restarted its bond purchasing program or quantitative easing measures, citing higher banks' borrowing costs because of the worsening credit crisis in Europe.\n\nGold was not able to extend its gains from last week, despite the global central banks' efforts to stimulate their economies. In the short-term, disinflationary forces around the globe, and the concern that the U.S. might not need to do QE3, are putting a damper on gold's advance.\n\nHowever, a number of houses including Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale are still calling for a QE3 in the U.S., and expect the gold prices to be well-supported by a lower real interest rate.\n\nWhile the European crisis deepens, investment demand for gold has continued to climb. The holdings in gold-backed ETPs rose to 2,413.61 tons, an all-time high, as of Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. Blackrock reported that investors switched out of the U.S. Treasuries ETPs and added US$2.2 billion to gold-backed ETPs in June.\n\nAll eyes will be on the U.S. June non-farm payrolls change on Friday, with the median forecast at 100,000. Market will watch for the Eurogroup meeting next Monday on Spanish bank aid, and the new loans and M2 growth data from China next Wednesday, as well as China's Q2 GDP growth number next Friday.\n\nNote: is the the online platform for Sharps Pixley Ltd, a physical precious metals trader. aims to bring you the latest gold news, live gold prices and gold charts and is an online shop for buying gold bars and gold coins.\n\nBuying gold has never been easier or more attractive and is a great investment. will allow those interested in buying precious metals to buy gold against the live spot price of gold, and will keep you informed of all the latest market trends using our gold news feeds, our gold charting tools, and displaying live gold prices from around the world.\n\nThis article is republished with permission from Sharps Pixley.\n\nClick here for more information about Sharps Pixley.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Sharps Pixley 2012\n\nPlease Note: This article is to inform your thinking, not lead it.

        "text":"Bankruptcy timetable holds firm; Action begins on Monday, Aug. 6\n\nNothing in the past week has changed the schedule for Mammoth\u2019s journey into bankruptcy protection.\n\nThat does not mean the town staff has just been sitting around, waiting for events to unfold.\n\nBehind the scenes this week, the staff has been working at a frantic pitch as staffers gather documents requested by Mammoth Lakes Land Acquisition (MLLA) as well as federal mediator Elizabeth Perris.\n\nThose documents may come into play as early as Monday, when the town and MLLA face each other for the first time in a scheduled two-day face-to-face mediation session.\n\nPerris has been Chief Judge of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Oregon from 1984 and U.S. Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Ninth Circuit from 1988\u20131993 and from 1998\u20132005.\n\nShe has been member of the California and Oregon State Bars since 1976, and the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules since 2007. She worked from 1976 to 1984 as a bankruptcy court law clerk, a bankruptcy trustee, and an attorney in private practice specializing in bankruptcy.\n\nJudge Perris has held other positions as past board member, Federal Judicial Center (FJC); past chair, FJC Bankruptcy Judges\u2019 Education Committee, and the Bankruptcy Section of the Federal Bar Association.\n\nShe also is hearing the Stockton bankruptcy case.\n\nThe sheer number of requests said Assistant Town Manager Marianna Marysheva-Martinez slowed the town business significantly.\n\n\u201cIt has been an enormous amount of work for the people in the town,\u201d she said at a Town Council meeting Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind we have only 17 employees. We have inquiries through walk-in, via-phone, via-email\u2014numerous inquiries on a daily basis, and it does create quite a distraction and takes away from what they need to do.\u201d\n\nAfter the mediation sessions on Monday and Tuesday, the next important date is Aug. 29, she said, for a \u201cstatus conference\u201d in which a judge in Sacramento will review objections to Mammoth\u2019s bid for bankruptcy protection. Those objections must be filed by Friday, Aug. 24.\n\nAt the Aug. 29 status conference, a judge then will set a date for a full-blown hearing to determine if Mammoth is eligible to declare bankruptcy.\n\nShould events reach that far, the town then would present its financial plan to a court and ask that it be approved.\n\n\u201cThose requests are a lot of work by staff,\u201d Marysheva-Martinez told the council. \u201cWe literally have to go back through emails and hard-copy files, in some cases going back to 2008 and 2009.\n\n\u201cWe are working extremely hard to meet those deadlines, so that\u2019s what is happening behind the scenes.\u201d",

I don\u2019t think monetary economics has broken, the basic laws I think remain in place and essentially as Europe recovers interest rates will normalize and, you know, economies will normalize.\u201d\n\nECB chief economist Peter Praet on Friday admitted the impact of the asset-buying scheme has been disappointing so far, but said growth was picking up.\n\nLane said there remained concerns about individual eurozone economies. \u201cWe have to remain vigilant to issues to do with the sustainability of sovereign debt and this I think is currently being managed in different ways but it remains an ongoing concern,\u201d Lane said.\n\nHe said the biggest challenge for the Irish Central Bank was managing the fallout from Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, which Lane said was his worst day since his appointment as governor in late 2015.\n\n\u201cIt was immediately obvious that ... (the) defining challenge for the country, for Europe and for us as a central bank is to manage Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\n\nAdd new comment\n\nRead our comment policy before posting your viewpoints",

This is an overall increase of $43.9 million or 2.2 per cent on the 2009 Budget.\n\nThis will fund recurrent expenditure of $1.622 billion and development expenditure of $375 million. The Finance Minister pointed out that the budget was put together under very difficult circumstances.\n\n\"The economy slowed significantly from the high growth rates achieved from 2006 to 2008 due largely to the global economic crises. In real terms, the economy is expected to grow by around 1.0 per cent in 2009, compared to 6.9 per cent in 2008.\n\n\"This is largely due to weakened external demand reducing log production and commodity prices, lower agricultural output due to floods in the first quarter of 2009 and slow growth in other sectors as government revenue became constrained.\"\n\nThe Minister stated that in order to ensure that the country comes out of the financial crises stronger there are two fundamental objectives that the Government is setting out to achieve in the government's budget.\n\n\"The first is to pursue structural reform to make the Solomon Islands an easy and reliable place to do business and invest and for industries to thrive and grow.\n\"The second is maintaining an affordable and sustainable Government budget which limits national debt to a manageable and sustainable level, improves Government decision making processes, and focuses on achieving our national development goals.\"",

        "text":"Rapyd raises $300M on a $2.5B valuation to boost its fintech-as-a-service API\n\nIngrid Lunden\n\u00b76 min read\nMulti Colored Bling Bling Dollar Sign Shape Bokeh Backdrop on Dark Background, Finance Concept.\n\nA wave of organizations -- propelled by global COVID-19 pandemic circumstances -- are moving their commercial and financial interactions online, and today one of the big players helping to enable that shift is announcing a significant round of growth funding to expand the tools and services that it provides to them.\n\nRapyd, which provides an API-based \"fintech-as-a-service\" platform covering payments, banking services, fraud protection and more, has raised $300 million, funding that CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman said in an interview will be used to expand its team, build out more technology (next up: expanded fraud ID services and a wider marketplace) and make selected acquisitions.\n\nRapyd's customer base now numbers about 5,000 businesses, which includes marketplaces (labor marketplaces and marketplaces for goods), e-commerce businesses, other kinds of lenders and any business that might want to incorporate transactions or new financial services into their wider offerings. Shtilman said that at the moment, Rapyd is seeing its strongest growth yet, onboarding about 500 new customers each week.\n\nThe funding is coming at a $2.5 billion post-money valuation, Shtilman confirmed. (For some context on that, Rapyd was last valued at $1.2 billion in December 2019.)\n\nThe round is a Series D and is being led by prolific growth-round VC Coatue, with Spark Capital, Avid Ventures, FJ Labs and Latitude (all new backers), as well as General Catalyst, Oak HC\/FT, Tiger Global, Target Global, Durable Capital, Tal Capital and Entr\u00e9e Capital (all previous backers) also participating. Other past investors, notably, include another major player in the world of API-based financial services, Stripe.\n\nAs with other companies in categories that have seen a huge surge of demand in the last year, financial services -- and in particular those providing services to be able to carry out transactions online via the internet or phone -- have proven to be some of the most mandatory and most used. (And no wonder, since bills still need paying, food and other items still need to be purchased, loans very much still need to be made and so on.)\n\nThis was what many would call an \"opportunistic\" raise, made not to keep the lights on or to extend runway, but because the money was being offered to Rapyd at good terms, and there were smart places where it could be put to use to grow the business.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t plan to raise money when we raised this round, but when the pandemic came in our business started to boom,\" Shtilman said. \"We were approached by existing investors to scale beyond our original business plans after we completed our 2021 growth plans in three months in 2020. So we thought the timing was probably right for world domination.\"\n\nShtilman was partly (only partly) joking -- he has a sort of deadpan delivery that I can't quite capture here -- but it's a far cry from the startup's early days, when \"no one wanted to invest because everyone thought it would be too hard to execute. Even our early investors advised us to focus on a smaller concept. But we thought building globally doesn\u2019t work. To start small is against the idea. Over the last several years, the need to explain what we do [has] almost vanished.\"\n\nThe challenge (and opportunity) that Rapyd identified back in 2017 when it first opened for business (having been hatched in Israel originally) is that the global commerce and financial markets are very highly fragmented. Consumers and businesses in individual markets have their own preferred payment methods and demands, regulations differ and the key companies involved vary from country to country.\n\nMeanwhile, APIs have long been a great instrument for integration and connection: Using a few lines of code -- and presuming your own services are built on code too -- you can knit together services, and bring in commoditized functionality that would take ages to build from the ground up, cutting down the effort and work needed, to focus on making your core business more unique.\n\nWhile companies like Stripe, Twilio and many others had identified the opportunity of leveraging APIs to scale out a world of functionality to a wider set of would-be customers, what Rapyd really identified and built out was the idea of loading not just one, two or three services, but hundreds (even thousands) of features into that proposition. In fintech, where those services are complex, there is a big array of them from which to choose what to build, and also a big pool of would-be customers to use them, if you are aiming wide.\n\nThe idea is smart and, as Shtilman noted, very much in keeping with the economies of scale that exist in e-commerce and fintech: Individual transactions are at the end of the day very incremental, so services that bring many together can finally start to conceive of interesting returns.\n\nThat, of course, is not just something Rapyd has identified and run with. That is to say, the company has a number of competitors now in the market.\n\nJust last week, Germany-based Mambu, which also provides an API-based suite of services (7,000 at last count) under the idea of \"banking as a service,\" raised $135 million at a valuation of over $2 billion. Stripe, a backer of Rapyd, also has continued to expand and add a number of services well beyond payments. Thought Machine also raised a big round last year; Temenos\u00a0and Italy\u2019s\u00a0Edera are also strong players here.\n\nAnd the field has so much opportunity that it's even attracting a lot of newer entrants: witness Unit, another interesting player that came out of stealth in the U.S. in December with an interesting list of backers of its own.\n\n\"To build financial infrastructure, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you are a small mom and pop or something bigger, you need many things, and if you want to sell in more than one jurisdiction you need a lot of those services,\" Shtilman noted about the need for scale and breadth in a fintech platform proposition.\u00a0He's also very sanguine about competition.\n\n\"They have emerged like mushrooms after the rain,\" he said. \"But if you don\u2019t have competition it means you don\u2019t have a business, so this is good. It means there is a lot of demand. But for now we are the market leader. We think we will become the AWS of this space.\"\n\nThat's where investors like Coatue are also landing for now.\n\n\u201cThe payment landscape varies dramatically across countries. A company doing business globally might need to accept hundreds of local payment methods. Rapyd\u2019s API, which abstracts away this complexity, is currently powering what we think are many of the world\u2019s most exciting companies,\u201d said Kris Fredrickson, managing partner at Coatue, in a statement. \u201cWe are honored to partner with Arik and team for the next phase of the Rapyd journey.\u201d",

        "text":"Natural Gas Up 3% as Supplies Drop\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Natural gas rose 3 percent, to the highest level since November, as the government said supplies of the fuel are nearly 20 percent below year-ago levels.\n\nOil rose slightly after positive U.S. jobs data, while the average price for a gallon of gasoline slipped back to $3.70.\n\nNatural gas futures gained 10 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $3.82 per 1,000 cubic feet in afternoon trading. The government reported that natural gas in storage shrank by 145 billion cubic feet to 1.938 trillion cubic feet for the week ended March 8. That's 18.5 percent below last year's level, although still 11 percent above the five-year average. Booming production created a glut that last year dropped natural gas to a decade low price below $2.\n\nThe price for natural gas has declined about 17 percent in three weeks as supplies dropped. Addison Armstrong, senior director of market research at Tradition Energy, says forecasts for cold weather through the end of March in the nation's primary gas-consuming areas have helped as well.\n\nOil rose slightly Thursday as U.S. employment data supported the market, offsetting news about ample crude supplies and worries about the eurozone economy. Weekly U.S. jobless claims fell by a greater-than-anticipated 10,000 to 332,000, helping to sustain hopes over the U.S. labor market.\n\nBenchmark oil for April delivery was up 23 cents to $92.75 a barrel in afternoon trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nBrent crude, used to price many kinds of oil imported by U.S. refineries, was up 88 cents to $109.40 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange in London.\n\nIn other energy futures trading on the Nymex:\n\n  \u2022 Wholesale gasoline lost 1 cent at $3.13 a gallon.\n  \u2022 Heating oil was unchanged at $2.92 a gallon.\n\n\nRead\/Post Comments (0) | Recommend This Article (1)\n\nComments from our Foolish Readers\n\nHelp us keep this a respectfully Foolish area!

        "text":"February 13, 2019 \/ 9:23 PM \/ 3 days ago\n\nJohnson & Johnson supplier seeks bankruptcy over talc lawsuits\n\n(Reuters) - A key supplier of talc used in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday in the wake of multibillion-dollar lawsuits alleging its products caused ovarian cancer and asbestos-related mesothelioma.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A bottle of Johnson and Johnson Baby Powder is seen in a photo illustration taken in New York, February 24, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/Illustration\n\nImerys Talc America, the U.S. unit of French group Imerys SA, said it filed for bankruptcy because it lacks the financial clout to defend against nearly 15,000 lawsuits over its talc mineral product, which is also used in cosmetics.\n\nImerys said that while it continued to believe the lawsuits are without merit, the prospect of rising settlement and defense costs over the next few years prompted the decision to file for bankruptcy.\n\nThey also cite a multibillion-dollar verdict against Johnson & Johnson and the ensuing media attention as factors that led to the Chapter 11 filing.\n\nIn July, a Missouri jury ordered J&J to pay a record $4.69 billion (3.65 billion pounds) to 22 women who said asbestos in talc caused ovarian cancer. J&J has said it is appealing that verdict.\n\nImerys said it had settled for an undisclosed amount prior to the trial.\n\nImerys also attributed its filing to a dispute over an indemnity agreement. Imerys said some of its supply agreements required J&J to indemnify Imerys, but it said the U.S. healthcare conglomerate had refused to do.\n\nImerys and J&J have repeatedly denied the allegations about talc, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe.\n\nJ&J on Wednesday declined to comment on Imerys Talc America\u2019s Chapter 11 filing and on the allegations against it over the indemnification agreements.\n\nReuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers.\n\nJ&J has said that its talc products do not contain asbestos.\n\nImerys said bankruptcy provided the best avenue for addressing its talc liability.\n\nBankruptcy provides Imerys a single forum to settle the widespread litigation. A similar strategy has been used by numerous companies facing litigation over faulty breast implants, products containing asbestos and recalled automotive airbags.\n\nTwo North American subsidiaries of Imerys, Imerys Talc Vermont and Imerys Talc Canada, also filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday.\n\nTotal revenue in 2018 for Imerys Talc America was $174 million, according to records filed with the Delaware Bankruptcy Court.\n\n\nImerys said in court documents it plans to use bankruptcy to establish a trust to pay personal injury claims, a strategy typically used by companies facing asbestos claims.\n\nWhen the company leaves bankruptcy, current and future litigation claims will be channeled to the trust rather than Imerys, which would be freed from future lawsuits over talc.\n\nImerys could finance the trust with the disputed indemnity agreement with J&J and its right to insurance proceeds, which the company estimated could be worth around $700 million. It said it also has a right to an undetermined portion of up to $2 billion of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s insurance.\n\nHowever, the company said some of the policies exclude asbestos claims and none of them cover claims in which the first exposure occurred after 1986. In addition, punitive damages are often not covered.\n\nImerys said it could exhaust some of those insurance proceeds within the first half of this year defending cases.\n\nCourt records show that the defense of a single case can cost $4 million.\n\nAs a co-defendant with J&J, Imerys has faced at least a dozen U.S. jury trials over allegations that its talc causes ovarian cancer or mesothelioma.\n\nWhile some juries awarded damages as high as $2.75 million against Imerys Talc America, many verdicts were later thrown out on appeal.\n\nImerys and J&J have also won several trials or had cases result in mistrials due to hung juries.\n\nThe verdicts against the company are all still on appeal and Imerys has not yet paid any of those verdicts. However, the company settled at least four cases before they went to trial for undisclosed amounts.\n\nMark Lanier, a Texas-based lawyer representing many of the talc plaintiffs, on Wednesday said Imerys Talc America\u2019s bankruptcy would not change the litigation.\n\n\u201cWe have always targeted our cases against J&J and Colgate Palmolive, the companies that put the asbestos laced talc into the products,\u201d Lanier said.\n\nColgate-Palmolive is another defendant in the U.S. talc litigation. The New York-based company sold Cashmere Bouquet, a cosmetic talcum powder, from 1871 to 1995.\n\nColgate did not respond to a request for comment. It has denied allegations that its talc products cause cancer.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing Bill Berkrot\n\n0 : 0\n  \u2022 narrow-browser-and-phone\n  \u2022 medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet\n  \u2022 landscape-tablet\n  \u2022 medium-wide-browser\n  \u2022 wide-browser-and-larger\n  \u2022 medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet\n  \u2022 medium-wide-browser-and-larger\n  \u2022 above-phone\n  \u2022 portrait-tablet-and-above\n  \u2022 above-portrait-tablet\n  \u2022 landscape-tablet-and-above\n  \u2022 landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser\n  \u2022 portrait-tablet-and-below\n  \u2022 landscape-tablet-and-below",

        "text":"London Bullion Assn chief\u2019s plan to tide over crisis, continue gold trading\n\nWorried that the gold trade can get gridlocked over the rupee crisis, London Bullion Market Association Chairman David Gornall suggests that India can swap for dollars the 200 tonnes of gold it bought from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2009. This can help the country tide over the problems created by trade imbalance.\n\n\u201cThe Reserve Bank of India bought 200 tonnes of gold for $1,045 an ounce from the IMF four years ago. The Government can swap it for US dollars,\u201d said Gornall, who is here for the India International Gold Convention 2013.\n\nAccording to RBI sources, the gold that India bought never came into the country as the transaction was only a book entry. The gold was purchased for $6.7 billion, in cash. Asked about this, Finance Ministry officials said the RBI will have to take a call on swapping the gold for dollars.\n\nEarlier, in his inaugural address, Gornall said the RBI can organise the gold-dollar swap without divesting its holding or incurring any further interest charge to access $23 billion.\n\n\u201cBy swapping gold for a payable currency, you can benefit by having access to the dollar for a period of your choice, while remaining a long-term holder of gold as the swap is a transfer of asset over a period. You will have bullion bank counter-party risk but this is successfully managed at the RBI which has strictest lending criteria of any central bank in the world.\u201d\n\nMaking it clear that he is not advocating sale but only swap of gold, Gornall said in this case gold and the dollar will provide collateral for each other.\n\nPointing out that gold had in the past climbed above $1,900 an ounce and crude oil over $100 a barrel, he wondered how the current account deficit was not as bad then as it is today. \u201cIndia has always had a deficit, a structural deficit, so what\u2019s different today?\u201d\n\nTurkey model\n\nReferring to the recent hike in the import duty on gold, the LBMA chief said it will only lead to smuggling.\n\nGornall said India should take a leaf out of Turkey\u2019s example, adapt and improve on it to suit the current situation. In 2001 and 2009, Turkey\u2019s current account deficit soared, currency fell and foreign exchange reserves dropped even as inflation hit 10 per cent. Based on the 1998 South Korean strategy, it decided to come up with a gold deposit scheme.\n\nThough Turkish citizens didn\u2019t donate gold like the Koreans did, the announcement of the plan resulted in markets buying the Turkish Lira.\n\nThis resulted in the exchange rate improving and the current account deficit falling even before the scheme became fully operational.\n\n\u201cThere is a lesson to be learnt here,\u201d Gornall said.\n\n(This article was published on August 17, 2013)\nXThese are links to The Hindu Business Line suggested by Outbrain, which may or may not be relevant to the other content on this page.
