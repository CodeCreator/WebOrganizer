        "text":"Dan Kenary of Harpoon Brewery Continues to Make Great Beer\n\nOctober 4, 2018\nIndependent and employee-owned harpoon is the second largest brewery in Massachusetts, behind Boston Beer Co. Now 32 years young, it\u2019s also Massachusetts\u2019 oldest, continually operating brewery. Ranked 16th largest craft brewer in the U.S. last year, the staying power of this brewery is impressive.\nWith returning holiday favorites like Harpoon Winter Warmer and UFO Winter Blonde, as well as new collaboration beers like the highly anticipated Dunkin\u2019 Coffee Porter, Dan Kenary and company have plenty of innovation on the docket to carry the portfolio into 2019 and beyond. Harpoon continues to stay true to their motto: Love Beer. Love Life.\nHere are 10 things Kenary wants you to know about Harpoon\u2026\n1. Harpoon is an independent, employee-owned craft brewery. But, Kenary says that even before they became employee owned, they already had the right mindset. \u201cWe were focused on working together to grow a company that would outlast any of us. When we added ownership to that, it changed the dynamic entirely. For the employees, it\u2019s a real financial incentive to succeed.\u201d\n2. Harpoon is currently available in 27 states and Puerto Rico.\n3. Kenary says he doesn\u2019t worry too much about staying relevant in a crowded beer market, rather he focuses on staying true to what he and his team do well. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to feel like you need to do everything. That\u2019s a tremendous amount of pressure \u2013 and it\u2019s just not a feasible expectation. Our founding vision was to make great beer fun.\u201d\n4. Harpoon\u2019s collaborative brews began as a result of their annual, employee beer trips. \u201cEveryone who works here for five years gets to travel to Europe for a week,\u201d says Kenary. \u201cAnd they get to go again on certain anniversaries after that. More often than not, we find breweries that we love while we\u2019re traveling.\u201d\n5. Their latest collab with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, available in October, grew out of an existing friendship. \u201cWe had crossed paths with the Dunkin\u2019 team over the years \u2013 at conferences, events, etc., and found we had a lot in common. We had worked together on some small projects over the years \u2013 a pilot batch for our Beer Hall, for example \u2013 but over time we started to think bigger. We couldn\u2019t be more excited to launch Dunkin\u2019 Coffee Porter.\u201d\n6. This year Harpoon introduced three hazy IPAs \u2013 Juicer 1, 2 and 3 \u2013 but they\u2019re only available in New England because Kenary says, \u201cThe reality is these beers are hard to make, and they are a challenge to distribute. More than other styles, freshness is key. We\u2019d love to see these available in markets throughout our footprint, but if we can\u2019t guarantee freshness, we just won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n7. Harpoon Winter Warmer, the first craft seasonal on the East Coast, will be back this November for its 30th year. This seasonal classic is a rich combination of holiday spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg, with a hearty, malt backbone.\n8. For the 10th year, Harpoon and local volunteers will decorate the Women of Change House in Philly for the holidays, through the Harpoon Helps charity initiative. Women of Change is a safe haven residence for women. It\u2019s part of the Project Home organization, where residents are offered personal recovery services, healthcare, education, social enterprise and employment opportunities.\n9. In 2019, Harpoon will introduce some traditional styles that will round out their core lineup, as well as a few things that are \u201cunlike anything we\u2019ve seen anyone else do before,\u201d Kenary says. \u201cIt\u2019s the most ambitious year we\u2019ve had in a while, and it\u2019s more than 18 months in the making.\u201d\n10. If Kenary could only drink one Harpoon beer for the rest of his life, it would be, \u201cHarpoon IPA, without question. It has all the flavor and complexity I love about beer, but it\u2019s balanced enough to be sessionable.\u201d\nshow visited",

We don\u2019t have a commercial relationship with these restaurants, they don\u2019t even know we recommend them, we just like them!\n\nEating on a Budget in Paris Without Eating Sandwiches and Kebabs Every Day\n\nIf you can pay 100\u20ac per person per meal, you\u2019ll eat like a king in Paris. But some of us can\u2019t afford 100\u20ac per meal! We don\u2019t want to eat kebab and sandwiches every day either.\n\nWine Bar\n\nChez Nous Wine Bar, 10 Rue Dauphine, 75006\u2013There are expensive bottles but they will gladly bring you 20\u20ac-30\u20ac bottles from a specific region of France. Tell them what you like, they will try to match it! Their appetizer plates are also a good value. This small, busy and can get loud. For a more peaceful experience, go right at opening around 6 PM.\n\nWine Tasting O Ch\u00e2teau, 68 Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Paris, France\u2013The sommelier will tell you all about the wine and they can serve some (stingy) appetizers.

Prices between 18\u20ac and 30\u20ac for lunch specials. They speak good English and you shouldn\u2019t hold it against them because the place is also full of locals.\n\nBistro 1, 4 rue de l\u2019\u00e9cole de M\u00e9decine, 75006 Paris\u2013Classic Parisian bistro, not too crowded, friendly, great value for the money, 15\u20ac for the lunch menu.\n\nSpecialties from the South West\n\nP\u00e8re Louis, 38 rue Monsieur le Prince 75006 Paris. They specialize in food from the South-West, they have a great wine list too. 20\u20ac-30\u20ac for dinner, lovely staff, good for groups as well.\n\nGrumpy French Chef\n\nL\u2019Auberge des Deux Ponts, 7 Rue Des Deux Ponts 75004 Paris +33 1 46 34 29 33\u2013This restaurant is one of a kind. The owner is both the waiter and the cook. He will single-handily whip up an amazing meal for you. Don\u2019t go if you\u2019re in a big hurry and be aware that the man is not PC, he\u2019ll tell you exactly what he thinks in French. Excellent value!\n\nFrench Cafeteria Food\n\nCaf\u00e9t\u00e9ria Galleries Lafayettes next to Op\u00e9ra Garnier\u2013This is a standard French cafeteria, but it\u2019s a good French cafeteria. While you\u2019re up there, also go to the roof terrace.\n\n\nCr\u00eaperie de Josselin, 67 Rue du Montparnasse, 75014 Paris, France\u2013There are cr\u00eaperies all over Paris, this one is one I like. I wouldn\u2019t go particularly out of my way for it, but if you\u2019re in the area, it\u2019s a good one.\n\nEssaouira, Moroccan Restaurant, 16 rue Magdebourg 75116 Paris\u2013Beautiful decor, classic Marrocan food, classic service, really close to the Trocadero, 22\u20ac-28\u20ac for dinner.\n\n\nL\u2019As du Fallafel, 34 rue des Rosiers 75004 Paris\u2013Very nice fallafels, but not the only good one in the area. Get there at noon sharp if you want any chance to sit down!\n\nClassy French YET Affordable\n\nBouillon Racine, 3 rue Racine, 75006 Paris\u2013Classic French service, 30\u20ac menu, good for a romantic evening or if you need a quieter, more roomy restaurant. Don\u2019t go with young kids.\n\n\n\nIf you love to cook at home you should really check out this App for meal planning and shopping. I\u2019ve been using it for a year and it\u2019s filled a real need and saved me a ton of time in my every-day life.\n\nLearn More: French Lifestyle and Customs\nSubscribe to the Podcast\nApple\u00a0Google\u00a0Spotify\u00a0RSS\nSupport the Show\nTip Your Guide\u00a0Extras\u00a0Patreon\u00a0Audio Tours\u00a0Merchandise",

        "text":"Avoid These Supermarket Buying Baits and Save More on Food\n\nAvoid These Supermarket Buying Baits and Save More on Food\n\nYou\u2019ve probably experienced going to the supermarket for a handful of items, only to find yourself leaving with a whole cart of stuff! Aside from the fact that some people don\u2019t have a grocery list to know exactly what they will buy, most supermarkets have devised clever ways to encourage customers to buy more than they plan to. Allow me to help you avoid these supermarket buying traps, so that you can save on your food purchases.\n\nIs saving on supermarket purchases difficult?\n\nSaving on your purchases doesn\u2019t have to involve rocket science. A few simple changes can already help you spend wisely on everyday purchases.\n\nYou may use available tools to develop wiser spending. For starters, websites such as www.okcalculator.com offer free online calculators to help you manage your spending habits. You may also write a journal of your income, bills, and expenses to monitor your finances regularly.\n\nSupermarket Buying Baits That You Need To Avoid\n\nBefore your next trip to the grocery, take note of these seemingly foolproof baits that big supermarkets use to lure unknowing consumers to buy more than what they need:\n\n1. Fresh produce are placed at the entrance.\n\nHave you noticed that most big-brand supermarkets put their fruits and vegetables section by the entrance? That\u2019s because it creates an image that the supermarket serves fresh and healthy food. As a result, consumers will feel less guilty buying more food, since the entire grocery store seems to be promoting a healthy lifestyle anyway.\n\nSurprised? According to sources, people who generally buy fresh produce will eventually spend more in the supermarket whose entrance starts with the fresh section.\n\n2. Necessities are found in the back aisles\n\nHave you noticed that the meat and dairy section are usually placed at the back of the grocery? That\u2019s because supermarkets are designed to expose you to the rest of the products before you reach the bare essentials.\n\n3. High-profit products are positioned front and center, with lucrative deals\n\nAs you enter most major supermarkets, you will be greeted by a huge display area where you see some big sale items. Many of these products are sold in bulk \u2013 usually in the form of \u201cbuy one, take one\u201d or heavy discount deals. Meanwhile, other groceries put small products near the cashier \u2013 say, a pack of gums and mints.\n\nChances are \u2013 even if you\u2019re not planning to buy them \u2013 you will have the urge to pick a few items from this shelf.\n\n4. Branded products are placed near complementary stuff\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised to find your favorite brand of peanut butter beside a shelf of bread products. That\u2019s the supermarket\u2019s way of enticing you to buy products that complement the others, even if you don\u2019t have any intention to purchase them.\n\nCall it clever marketing, because a huge chunk of customers will probably grab a jar of peanut butter on this aisle without even looking at other alternatives that are actually cheaper!\n\n5. Aisle ends are stocked with products that generate higher profit\n\nSome people don\u2019t immediately cut into the aisle sections; instead, they walk by the supermarket hallways perpendicular to the aisles. That way, they can browse the contents of the aisle in only a few steps.\n\nSupermarket execs know this, and so they use the ends of the aisles to put products that will bring them more profit. In short, grocery items placed on aisle ends are usually higher priced than similar products.\n\nAll of these traps and baits won\u2019t matter if you have the willpower to say no. Don\u2019t let these supermarket buying traps fool you \u2013 stand your ground and stick only to what you need to buy!\n\nImage source: https:\/\/pixabay.com\/en\/shopping-bottle-woman-grocery-2411667\/\n\nAnnouncement List\n\nOne Reply to \u201cAvoid These Supermarket Buying Baits and Save More on Food\u201d\n\n  1. Brigid OHara Koshko says: Reply\n\n    Great advice! We have had many changes to our budget and I am trying desperately to find ways to cut corners.

Crisp and tart with good minerality and notes of lime.\n\nBrancott \u201cFlight Song\u201d Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2016 ($15). Only nine percent alcohol; tart, light flavors of lime and apples, and a little short on the finish.\n\nAlois Lageder Porer Alto Adige Pinot Grigio 2015 ($20). A standout among pinot grigios, with full-flavored fruit, good balance, and pleasant orange notes.\n\nRobert Mondavi Napa Valley Fum\u00e9 Blanc 2015 ($20). Very nice, with tropical fruit notes to go along with the greener flavors.\n\nTerlato Friuli Pinot Grigio 2016 ($23). A fair amount of juiciness, dropping off to a papery finish.\n\nCliff Lede Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc 2016 ($24). Delicious and creamy with good structure and a long finish.\n\nJoseph Drouhin Vaudon Chablis 2015 ($24). A generous wine but not a big one, with flavors of apples and lemon and a touch of toast.\n\nRombauer Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc 2016 ($25). Fresh lime and grapefruit flavors, medium body, and a pleasing finish.\n\nGroth Hillview Napa Valley Chardonnay 2015 ($30). Full-bodied, with a flavor of apples, well-integrated oak, and a little tanginess in the finish.\n\nDampt Fr\u00e8res Les Fourneaux Chablis 1er Cru 2014 ($31). A good food wine, with orange-peel minerality, light tannins, and good length on the palate.\n\nVocoret et Fils Les Forets Chablis 1er Cru 2015 ($31). A touch of tanginess, and good presence, with savory and mineral notes.\n\nBrancott \u201cB\u201d Letter Series Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2016 ($34). Very spicy, with fruity red raspberry flavors, unusual but interesting in a white wine.\n\nPali Huber Vineyard Sta. Rita Hills Chardonnay 2013 ($38). Fresh and juicy with just-cut apple flavors and moderate oak.\n\nBenovia Fort Ross-Seaview Chardonnay 2014 ($46). Full, juicy, spicy, piquant, and oaky!\n\nRobert Mondavi Oakville Fum\u00e9 Blanc 2014 ($40). A vivacious, rich intensity of fruit paired with considerable oak notes.\n\nRobert Mondavi To Kalon Napa Valley Fum\u00e9 Blanc Reserve 2014 ($52). Light and elegant, with old and new oak blended with fresh fruitiness.\n\nLes Dauphins C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Reserve Ros\u00e9 2016 ($9). Crisp and dry with light strawberry and melon flavors.\n\nPenfolds \u201cMax\u2019s\u201d South Australia Cabernet Sauvignon 2015 ($20). Good red fruitiness and wood integration, with a sharp edge in the finish.\n\nPenfolds \u201cMax\u2019s\u201d South Australia Shiraz Cabernet 2015 ($20). Fruity-sweet\u00a0(this is one for lovers of sweeter wines), with some sharp savory notes.\n\nJoseph Drouhin Hospices de Belleville Fleurie 2014 ($22). Refreshing, spicy, pinot noir-like fruit with well-done acidity and structure.\n\nTower 15 \u201cThe Swell\u201d Paso Robles Red Blend 2013 ($22). Lean and tight with bright berry flavors and a pronounced cabernet slant.\n\nCooper & Thief California Red Wine Blend 2014 ($28). An interesting wine, but not one for the table, with its 17 percent alcohol and strong vanilla flavors (from aging in used bourbon barrels) complementing its blackberry notes; a wine for sipping only.\n\nRobert Mondavi \u201cMaestro\u201d Napa Valley Red Wine 2014 ($50). Very well made with mature blackberry flavors, savory notes, a dollop of cream, and smooth tannins.\n\nJoseph Drouhin Gevrey-Chambertin 2014 ($58). Full-bodied, but with a tart fruitiness and excellent structure.\n\n\nRelated Links\nTraditional Sushi Pairs With California Wines25 New Chardonnays, Sauvignon Blancs, and Other Good Things17 Bottles Offering a Great Cross-Section of Italian Wine",

        "text":"Healthiest Fast-Food Menu Items\n\nby in Dining Out, July 10, 2012\n\nwendy's chicken wrap\nCar trips are a fun way to spend time with your family, but with most rest stops fronting fast food joints, healthy eating can seem impossible. If you\u2019re tired of continually saying NO to fast food\u2014ease up, there are healthier choices you can make. Check out our list so you\u2019re prepared on your next trip.\n\nIt was refreshing to see several healthy options provided on the\u00a0Wendy\u2019s website\u00a0including the Grilled Chicken Go Wrap (pictured above) with a side of small chili (totaling 470 calories for the meal). The problem is, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to be in a car with someone who just had chili! Luckily, you can opt for the baked potato instead or even the wrap with a small side salad (also for 470 calories). Looking to cut calories down? Wendy\u2019s allows you to hold ingredients (like cheese or sour cream) so you tailor the meal to your liking.\n\nCheck out more healthy\u00a0Wendy\u2019s options.\n\nIn my neck of the woods, Arby\u2019s seems to be at every rest stop. For a filling meal, opt for the Chopped Farmhouse Roasted Chicken Salad with chopped lettuce, diced tomato, red onion, pepper bacon, shredded cheddar and roasted chicken. The calories without the dressing are 250 calories, 14 grams fat, 7 grams saturated fat and 670 milligrams sodium. Add the light Italian dressing for an additional 20 calories.\n\nDo you eat gluten-free? Arby\u2019s also has an extensive gluten-free menu\u00a0to choose from.\n\nChoose any of the 10 6-inch sandwich options for 6 grams of fat or less and your sandwich will be between 230 to 380 calories. One of my favorites is the Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki\u2014my pick for a family car trip. Pair with a water and small bag of Baked Lays for 130 calories more.\n\nCheck out more healthy Subway options.\n\nOrder Franks RedHot Chicken Sandwich for 340 calories, 16 grams of fat and 8 grams saturated fat, or if you really want a burger, the kids\u2019 burger has 280 calories and 12 grams of fat. Unfortunately, the only veggie on the menu is the fries with a small weighing in at 300 calories\u2014if you really need some, then share.\n\nTaco Bell\nYou definitely have many calorie-friendly choices at Taco Bell. My basic rule of thumb is no bean dishes in car rides (unless you are driving by yourself). Keeping that in mind, you can order 2 Fresco Chicken Soft Tacos or Fresco Grilled Steak Soft Tacos for 150 calories and about 4 grams of fat each or a chicken or steak Gordita Extreme for 270 calories and between 10-11 grams of fat each.\n\nFind more healthy choices\u00a0at Taco Bell.\n\nTELL US: How do you choose healthy fast food on the road?\n\n\nMore posts from .\n\nSimilar Posts\n\nOrder This, Not That: Panda Express\n\nFind out what to order when dining at Panda Express....",

Or even if you do, you might want to find a recipe to cook in the campfire anyways\u2014just because it is fun! Of course there is the classic roasting hotdogs over the fire, but this blog seeks to give you some camping hacks that are easy to pull off and still delicious!\n\n1. Hobos\n\nHobos are delicious and easy to prep and cook. You will need aluminum foil, chopped vegetables and potatoes, and a protein of your choice. You can either prep the veggies and meat at home before you leave or at the camp site. Put the cut up vegetables and meat (for example chicken, potatoes, carrots, and onions) in a large piece of foil with a tablespoon or so of butter and salt and pepper to taste. Once you have a coal bed going in your campfire, fold up the foil into a pouch and place it in the fire. Cook time will depend on the temperature of your fire. Be sure to check that your protein is thoroughly cooked before digging in.\n\n2. Not Your Average S\u2019more\n\nS\u2019mores are so tasty but if you want something chocolaty that is a little different try this simple recipe. You will need a bag of small flour tortillas, brown sugar, and a jar of Nutella. Butter one side of two tortillas and then spread Nutella on the opposite side of one tortilla. Sprinkle brown sugar on the Nutella and then top with the other tortilla. Cook in a skillet on your camp stove or the stove top in your RV until brown sugar is melty.\n\nIf You Enjoyed This Blog About 2 Delicious Camping Hacks Feel Free To Share This With Your Friends!\n\nAlso Enjoy These Blogs\nShare Button",

        "text":"Holiday Cooking Essentials\n\n6 gluten-free cooking essentials for the holiday season\n\nEveryone has their own go-to products in their kitchen. For me, it\u2019s heavy cream and coffee, to name a few. For our office, it\u2019s half-and-half, coffee, tea, and orange juice. But around the holidays, we all add a few different products to our kitchen pantry. Whether it\u2019s something we know we\u2019ll be using for the big holiday meals or foods we crave throughout the winter months, we all have some annual go-to products we turn to. This year, I have some new must-have products that I\u2019ve been stocking my kitchen with. Check them out \u2013 you might just find a new favorite!\n\nRock Maple Mountain Syrup\n\nRock Maple Mountain\u2019s Maple Syrup\n\nMaple syrup is often found in my kitchen, whether it\u2019s for use in breakfast foods, baked goods, or to sweeten snacks like oatmeal and yogurt. That said, I hope you all know I\u2019m referring to REAL maple syrup, not the artificial stuff. Not only is that stuff bad for you, but the flavor just doesn\u2019t compare to the real stuff. Once you use real maple syrup, you can\u2019t go back to the high-fructose-knock-off stuff! Rock Maple Mountain is a new brand in my kitchen, and I must say, it\u2019s fantastic! It\u2019s organic, multi-filtered and uses a single-barrel approach, rather than a blend. I always figured pure maple syrup is pure maple syrup and I didn\u2019t think the process mattered much, but the taste proves that it does. You can read specifics about their process here.\n\nI also love that this company is run by a family and is a small business \u2013 it adds to the experience of eating this syrup \u2013 like you just went to a farmers market or something.\n\nGrab a bottle of Rock Maple Mountain to use in all your holiday baked goods and breakfasts!\n\nMyBread Baguette\n\nMyBread\u2019s Gluten-Free Baguettes & Rolls\n\nBread is a big deal this time of year. Toasted slices of baguette can be paired with cheese or a spread, rolls get slathered with butter and served alongside the holiday meal, and of course leftover sandwiches can be made with all sorts of breads. MyBread is another new brand in my kitchen, and I\u2019m so happy about that! They offer pita bread, baguettes, and rolls. All are free from gluten, dairy, eggs, nuts, and soy, making them perfect for my mixed-diet family! I like to use the baguettes for my super simple crostini appetizers and serve the rolls for dinnertime.\nWhat\u2019s great about these products is that they all have the same taste and texture that I remember wheat-based products having. This is really impressive since they don\u2019t contain the other \u201ckey\u201d ingredients found in a lot of bread products (gluten, eggs, and dairy).\n\nBreak bread with your friends and family this holiday with MyBread products!\n\nPath of Life Cauliflower Mash\n\nPath of Life\u2019s Convenient Side Dishes\n\nThe holidays are a stressful time of year. There\u2019s planning and cooking and braving the grocery store lines, and all errands seem to take at least 15 minutes longer regardless of what day it is in December. Luckily, companies like Path of Life have our backs. They produce frozen side dishes that just need to be heated up! You can add things to them if you want, turn them from side dishes to main dishes, include them in a recipe, or eat them just the way they are. One of my favorite ideas is to use their roasted garlic cauliflower to create a mashed cauliflower side dish for the holidays or for any day! This is particularly great for people who don\u2019t eat potatoes, such as those on a Paleo diet. It\u2019s also a nice change of pace from traditional mashed potatoes for holiday dinner. To get the recipe for mashed cauliflower, click here.\n\nOther delicious side dishes include quinoa with kale and mushrooms, quinoa with root vegetables, and more. Keep a few of these in your freezer for an easy side dish throughout the busy holiday months.\n\nCheck out Path of Life\u2019s offerings to make cooking more convenient!\n\n\nSchar Crackers\n\nSch\u00e4r\u2019s Crackers and More\n\nSch\u00e4r is such a popular name in gluten-free essentials. From breads to crackers to cookies and so much more, chances are if you\u2019re gluten-free, you\u2019ve had a Sch\u00e4r product at least once! Sch\u00e4r is definitely not new in my kitchen \u2013 they\u2019re a veteran in my pantry. I keep products like graham crackers, cookies, breads, and crackers on hand for all sorts of use. Their crackers, in particular, are perfect this time of year because all you have to do is set out a plate of those and a dip to satisfy those hungry mouths that keep asking when dinner will be ready! They\u2019re great for serving to guests because they don\u2019t taste any different than gluten-filled crackers, so even those who scoff at gluten-free products will be none the wiser.\n\nPick up a box of Sch\u00e4r crackers and check out the other essentials they offer!\n\n\nSummerhill Dairy Goat Milk\n\nSummerhill Dairy\u2019s Goat Milk\n\nMilk is an essential in my house. I use it for baking and cooking quite often. What I like about goat milk, though, is that people who usually can\u2019t have cow milk can often have goat milk, meaning the delicious foods I make with goat milk can be enjoyed by more of my guests. Goat milk has less lactose and different casein proteins than cow\u2019s milk, making it easier to digest. Goat milk tastes a little different than cow milk when you drink it plain, but if you cook or bake with it, it\u2019s basically the same in most cases. I have had it impart a unique undertone to some foods that guests actually loved, they asked what I used in the recipe because they couldn\u2019t quite put their finger on it. Summerhill Dairy offers goat milk that is Certified Humane, which is important if you want to ensure your milk comes from a source that treats their animals right. And it\u2019s the holidays, so who doesn\u2019t want good will towards animals?\n\nGive Summerhill Dairy goat milk a try in your baked goods this holiday season!\n\nParmCrisps in Soup\n\nParmCrisps Parmesan Cheese Crisps\n\nLast but not least, ParmCrisps! These have been a go-to of mine for a while now and they truly are a delicious, unique way to add crunch to so many things. You can bread chicken with these, top your salads with them (like croutons), eat them with a dip or spread, add them to a charcuterie board, and so much more. For the holiday season, I love to offer these as a topping to soups and salads. Guests love them because they are still very new to the market and a lot of people haven\u2019t tried them in all the ways they can be used. They\u2019re one of those products that some of my friends and family had said, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen those at the grocery store.\u201d but they haven\u2019t bought any until they were served at my house. It\u2019s fun to introduce people to foods that they didn\u2019t know they needed! ParmCrisps are Keto-friendly, contain zero carbs, and are naturally gluten-free and protein-packed.\n\nExplore the flavors ParmCrisps has to offer and share the deliciousness!\n\nTags: Baguette Crackers Holiday Maple Syrup Milk MyBread ParmCrisps Path of Life Rock Maple Mountain Schar Summerhill Dairy\nPrevious Post\n\nCranberry Pavlova Recipe\n\nNext Post\n\nGluten-Free Christmas Cupcakes in a Jar\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"5 Foods Natives Hunted Before Europeans\n\n\nWhat do you call a Native American vegetarian?\nA bad hunter.\nHeid Erdrich, a cook and author from the Turtle Mountain Band of Ojibwe in present-day North Dakota, references this old joke in her recent \u201clocavore\u201d cookbook, Original Local: Indigenous Foods, Stories, and Recipes From the Upper Midwest.She adds that this witticism used to make her mad, because it implies Indians are strictly carnivores, and she herself abides by a sort-of quasi-vegetariansim, as she puts it.\n\nBut as a non-purist raised near the Great Lakes and Great Plains, where her family hunted animals, in addition to cultivating plants and gathering wild foods, Heid dedicates an entire section of her book to indigenous fish and game animals, or their domesticated descenants: bison, duck, venison, rabbit, turkey and small wild fowl.Last week, Indian Country Today Media Network featured 10 foods that Natives had long before European contact. As a follow-up, we are highlighting animals that Natives hunted pre \u201cdiscovery.\u201d Next week, read about the five foods our ancestors fished and caught, and how those culinary traditions carry on today.\n\n1. Turkey, Goose, Duck and Small Fowl\nAfter Indians introduced Europeans to turkey, the bird was quickly adopted as a banquet food, soon serving as the centerpiece of many holiday meals. Pre-contact, however, wild turkey was everyday fare. Some Native cultures though, like the Maya, did use the meat, broth and blood in ceremony to heal sickness, help with planting and to pray for rain.Heid E. Erdrich recommends hunting wild turkey (no easy feat, she acknowledges) or ordering a heritage turkey, which are much leaner and smaller than sedentary commercial birds. This means fast cooking at high temperatures is a better method than slow roasting, she notes. Local Harvest (localharvest.org), an online service where you can order wild turkey, even offers yummy ways to baste the bird, such as with rosemary and maple.\n\nErdirch clarifies:\n\u201cJust as the term Indian was mistakenly applie to the people of an entire hemisphere, the turkey, it is said, was named for the middle eastern country. Turkey was once Mizise in Anishinaabemowin. No doubt the bird has hundreds of names in other indigenous languages, some of which must have meant really, really tasty.\u201d\n\nAlaska Natives regularly cook goose, explains Navajo Chef Freddie Bitsoie, who tried his culinary skills at preparing it for the first time in October 2011 while visiting the northwestern-most U.S. state, where he was filming a preliminary episode of the show Reservations Not Required. The cooking and travel program, told through the unique perspective of indigenous cultures, is hosted by Bitsoie.The rich-tasting, dark meat bird is oily and greasy like duck, \u201cso you have to trim a lot of the fat off before roasting it.\u201d\n\nThe bird should also be cooked on a baking rack in a roasting pan to drain off excess fat. \u201cOtherwise it will be swimming in goose fat, and you don\u2019t want that,\u201d Bitsoie says.Bitsoie offers a basic recipe: rub down the goose with three table spoons of melted butter mixed with a lot of fresh herbs: three tablespoons of chopped rosemary, parsley and thyme, and two tablespoons of tarragon. Before it solidifies, brush it on the goose as well as under the skin, Bitsoie says. Put extra rosemary stems on top of the goose and season it very well with salt and pepper.\n\nHe also recommends stuffing the goose with a 1\/2 cup of dried apricots, a cup of dried berries, three chopped onions, two stems of chopped celery and one chopped carrot.\u201cThis will give it a sweetness. Once you plate it, you can remove the berries and celery for garnish. They serve an aromatic purpose; they\u2019re not a side dish,\u201d Bitsoie explains.The typical rule of thumb is to roast the goose approximately 10 minutes for every pound. \u201cOnce you remove it, it\u2019s going to have a very nice amount of flavor,\u201d he says. \u201cGoose is something I think everybody should try; I absolutely fell in love with it.\u201d\n\nDucks are also Turtle Island native birds. Migrating wild ducks provided indigenous peoples along the Pacific Northwest with their first fresh meat in the annual food cycle, The Mitsitam Cafe Cookbook states. \u201cNative communities had varying techniques for capturing the ducks. The S\u2019Klallam people of the Olympic Peninsula in present-day Washington State erected 40-foot-high poles strung with fine net into which flocks of ducks would lfy in th edim light of dawn or sunset.\n\nOther Coast Salish hunters tied nets between trees, and the Makah submerged netting covered with salmon eggs in lakes and streams where the ducks typically fed,\u201d author Chef Richard Hetzler writes. Small game birds traditionally eaten by the Plains region indigenous peoples include quail, partridge (timber chicken) and grouse, some now protected from hunting. Erdrich describes small game birds as lean and distinct in flavor.\n\n2. Elk\nElk meat is a traditional, staple food of many indigenous cultures. \u201cA lot of our elders, that\u2019s all they\u2019ll eat \u2013 the traditional Indian food that we give them,\u201d Chester Cayou Jr., a respected Swinomish tribal hunter, told NWIFC.org.Elk, and other wildlife, remains a significant element of feasts for funerals, naming ceremonies and potlatches, NWIFC states. It\u2019s not just the meat that is cherished. The hdes, hooves, antlers and other wildlife parts are used for traditional ceremonial items and regalia.\n\nHunting elk also mean sustaining its future by protecting its habitat. And tribal hunters are only taking about 1 percent of the total combined deer and elk harvest in the state. \u201cWe don\u2019t impact the resource like some people think \u2013 we just take what we need,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cLast year, we took one elk. That\u2019s hardly anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHunting was and is a way of life to us,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cIt\u2019s important to us to preserve that tradition.\u201dElk meat has a rich, slightly sweet flavor that is milder than other venison like caribou, deer or moose, explains Salish Country Cookbook: Traditional Foods & Medicines from the Pacific Northwest.\n\nElk meat stew is a coveted, traditional dish on cold Northwest winter nights. Salish Country Cookbook offers a recipe for elk meat stew, which is thickened with cattail flour (or brown rice flour) and arrowroot. It also combines quamash roots (if available), wild or conventional carrots, onions, and is seasoned with juniper berries, sage, rosemary and thyme.\n\n3. Buffalo\nBuffalo are the spirit of the Indian people, a reminder of when our ancestors once lived, free and in harmony with nature, as the InterTribal Buffalo Council puts it.\u201cThe Indian was frugal in the midst of plenty,\u201d says Luther Standing Bear, a member of the Lakota tribe. \u201cWhen the buffalo roamed the plains in multitudes, he slaughtered only what he could eat and these he used to the hair and bones.\u201d\n\nSettlers recognized the reliance Indian tribes had on the buffalo, and began the systematic destruction of the species to cripple the indigenous people. American Indians are veterans of the struggle to pull the American bison back from near extinction, wrote Steve Russell for ICTMN. Gen. Philip Sheridan famously stated the motive: \u201cYou kill the buffalo, you destroy the Indian\u2019s commissary.\u201d\n\nRussell described: And so the colonists attacked the giant herbivores with repeating rifles, stripped off their hides and left tall stacks of malodorous meat to rot on the prairies until the iconic beasts were reduced by nature\u2019s scavengers to piles of bones. The population of American bison has been estimated by biologists at 60 million in 1492. By the end of the shooting part of the Indian wars in 1890, that population was reduced to 750.\n\nToday American Indians continue their efforts to revive the bison population, with great success. The Rapid City, South Dakota-based InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC), formed in September 1992, is committed to reestablishing buffalo herds on Indian lands in a manner that promotes cultural enhancement, spiritual revitalization, ecological restoration, and economic development.ITBC has a membership of 56 tribes in 19 states with a collective herd of over 15,000 bison.\n\nBison meat can be purchased through ITBC member tribes: the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, the Comanche Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, the Modoc Tribe of Okalahoma, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. Bison meat lends a hearty, sweet, rich flavor. The lean protein is low in fat, cholesterol and calories. Dale Carson recommends a recipe for buffalo pot roast here.\n\nAnother popular use of buffalo meat, particularly among the Great Plains, Lakota, Cheyenne, Crow and other tribal cooks, is drying the buffalo and pounding it with berries and fat to make pemmican, an earlier version of today\u2019s jerky. Hunters and warriors carried the protein-rich snack to provide sustenance and stamina when meat was difficult to find.\n\n4. Venison\nFor millennia, deer has been among the most abundant game animals in the Northern Hemisphere and Mesoamerica.Deer meat can be grilled, fried, stewed or roasted. Beyond its culinary potential, the animal has many practical and spiritual uses. As Dale Carson, Abenaki, puts it: \u201cWhile preparing venison, I think of my ancestors. When they cooked, the animal\u2019s skin became clothing and covered dwellings. Antlers become many things: ornaments, tools or rakes. American Indians never waste any part of these animals, nor do they fail to thank its spirit for the gift of its life.\n\n\u201dThe Mitsitam Cafe Cookbook underscores the Pueblo tribes spiritual connection to the animal. \u201cThe Pueblo tribes of the Southwest incorporate deer into their winter dances, and the Hupa of northern California perform a 10-day White Deerskin Ceremony to dissipate evil.\u201d\n\n5. Rabbit\n\u201cThis is a far cry from the tough times when my mother and grandmother would send my uncles out to hunt dinner,\u201d Dale Carson says about the ability to buy domesticated rabbit today. \u201cThey would bring back one or two ...

        "text":"America offers a fascinating array of cuisines, culled from native ingredients and the imported flavors of countless countries. This summer, get a taste of all the country has to offer by visiting different regions of the United States\u2014from the comfort of your own kitchen. Even if you don't have a chance to travel cross-country this summer, you can take your family and their taste buds on a trip they won't soon forget. From the northern reaches of New England to the expanse of the West, we've got coast-to-coast menus celebrating all the flavors of the land of the free.\n\nNew England\n\nWith its picturesque seaside towns and storied history, New England is home to a number of unique food traditions. Seafood\u2014particularly lobster, clams and crab\u2014is a standout, as are dishes featuring beans and corn, which harkens back to the culinary cross-pollination of colonists and native peoples. To really enjoy the best the region has to offer, when preparing the crabmeat salad recipe listed below, try using East Coast varieties of shellfish, including blue, peekytoe or rock\/spider crab. Photographed for Woman's Day by Stephanie Foley\n\nHearty Clam Chowder (shown above)\n\nCrabmeat Salad Nests\n\nSuccotash Salad\nBoston Cream Pie\n\nThe South\n\nFamed for its rich dishes abundant in flavor (and charm), this region's cuisine is one of America's most distinctive. While the dishes may be similar from state to state \u2014you'll find plenty of sweet potatoes, pecans, pork and fried dishes\u2014the preparation varies greatly. To wit: The South is hailed for its barbecue, but no one prepares it quite the same way, from vinegar-basted pork ribs in Northeast Carolina to spicy slabs with white sauce in Alabama. Photographed for Woman's Day by Iain Bagwell.\n\nPecan-Crusted Catfish (shown above)\n\nBest-Ever Fried Chicken\n\nTender Flaky Biscuits\nPeach-Blackberry Cobblers\n\nGulf Coast\n\nThe Gulf shares a number of culinary customs with the South, but it still maintains its own distinct style, thanks to early European settlers\u2014namely French and Spanish\u2014whose contributions evolved into what's known today as Cajun and Creole cooking. The two cuisines are unique, but share a number of common elements: the use of seafood, spices, roux-based sauces and rice. Photographed for Woman's Day by Mark Thomas.\n\nNew Orleans Shrimp 'n' Grits (shown above)\n\nShrimp Gumbo\n\nSausage and Chicken Jambalaya\nHeavenly Bananas Foster Bread Pudding\n\n\nSimple and substantial defines the \"breadbasket\" of America. Farming is at the heart of the region, which was shaped by Western European influences\u2014predominantly German and Scandinavian\u2014and bleak, hard winters that forced residents to shy away from fresh produce and exotic spices and lean more toward hearty casseroles and meat dishes. Dairy is a mainstay of the region, in addition to starchy vegetables, red meat and freshwater fish such as trout. Photographed for Woman's Day by Charles Schiller.\n\nLentil and Ham Stew\n\nPanfried Trout\n\nThe Best Meat Loaf (shown above)\nOatmeal Superchip Cookies\n\n\nSettled by adventurers in search of a different lifestyle, these states continue to trailblaze in the kitchen, creating a cuisine that is a unique\u2014and often fiery\u2014combination of influences from Mexican and Spanish settlers and Native American tribes. Here you'll find chile peppers grilled, roasted and stuffed in myriad ways, as well as used in piquant, fresh salsas. Photographed for Woman's Day by Caren Alpert.\n\nSlow-Cooker Chicken Posole\n\nCorn-Stuffed Poblano Chiles\n\nGrilled Southwestern Pasta Salad (shown above)\nMargarita Cheesecake Bars\n\nWest Coast\n\nRenowned for its focus on eating fresh and local\u2014not to mention the creation of Fusion cuisine\u2014the West Coast is one place a foodie could never be bored. Given its local abundance and ethnic diversity, the cuisine here is a lively mix, including Mexican, Asian and Southeast Asian styles. California is a produce powerhouse, providing more than half of the country's fruits and vegetables, while the Pacific Northwest\u2014particularly Oregon, Alaska and Washington\u2014is praised for its seafood, stone fruit and coffee. To celebrate the region's best exports, opt for Pacific halibut for the fish recipe below and a Washington variety of apple, such as Braeburn or Fuji, for the chicken's stuffing.

        "text":"\u2022 The Daily Meal\n\n  \u2022 iStock\n\n  \u2022 iStock\n\n  \u2022 McDonald\u2019s\n\n  \u2022 The Daily Meal\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s that we know and love, identified by those iconic Golden Arches, had humble beginnings. The restaurant first opened as McDonald\u2019s Bar-B-Q Restaurant in San Bernardino, Calif., in 1940, serving a simple menu of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, and shakes. Over the next several years, founders Dick and Mac McDonald renovated the restaurant and highlighted their $0.15 hamburger. \u00a0\n\nIn 1954, Ray Croc visited the restaurant and talked the McDonald brothers into creating a national burger chain. The first franchised McDonald\u2019s location opened in Des Plaines, Ill., in 1955 incorporating the very first Golden Arches, designed by architect Stanley Meston.\n\nToday, McDonald\u2019s is the largest hamburger fast-food chain in the world, and serves more than 58 million customers daily. While McDonald\u2019s continues to have a set staple menu throughout most of their locations, the chain is continuously trying to invent both local, national and international menu items to bolster its offerings. \u00a0\n\nFor instance, specialty menu items such as the Big Mac or Chicken McNuggets have been huge commercial successes across the board. But other items have been launched, and have subsequently vanished just as quickly. Items such as the Bacon Bacon McBacon, the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich, and the Home-Fried Chicken never quite caught on with American consumers. In local markets, McDonald\u2019s has even rolled out items like the McLobster on the East Coast, poutine in Canada, and the McCrab in parts of Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia\n\nIn order to assemble our list of the top 10 McDonald\u2019s flops, we took into account the cost of the (unsuccessful) advertising campaign, the lack of commercial success of an item, as well as the duration of which the particular product or promotion existed. So the least successful of the lot were ones that not only came and went quickly, but wasted plenty of the company\u2019s money as well.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s continues to roll out new products all the time; some will make it big, others will vanish off the menu without a trace.\n\n  \u2022 1.\u00a0McLobster\n\n    The Daily Meal\n\n    One of the seasonal and local menu items that popped up on McDonald\u2019s menus in eastern Canada and New England during select summer months was the infamous McLobster. The company produced this faux lobster roll in a hot dog bun during the summertime, when lobster prices were relatively cheap. But \"cheap\" (for lobster) didn\u2019t match up with the McDonald\u2019s clientele. The sandwich clocked in at $5.99, and customers veered away from the expensive special.\n\n  \u2022 2.\u00a0The Hula Burger\n\n\n    The Hula Burger was the brainchild of owner Ray Kroc. He believed that this meatless burger, containing grilled pineapple with cheese on a bun, would be a perfect option for Catholics who abstain from eating meat during Lent. While the Filet-O-Fish, another Lent-inspired option, still remains popular to this day, the Hula Burger did not enjoy such long-term success.\n\n  \u2022 3.\u00a0McCrab\n\n\n    Similar to other seasonal flops like the McLobster, the McCrab was created for a specific regional area in the U.S. comprised of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. The item was meant to resemble a classic Chesapeake crabcake but was lacking in the fresh ingredient department.\n\n  \u2022 4.\u00a0\"Super-Size\"\n\n\n    McDonald\u2019s created a massive advertising campaign around the idea of upgrading and expanding their classic meals to be \"super-sized\" in the mid-1990s. For a while, the idea sold, and customers around the world were super-sizing their orders, and the calorie content. After the release of the documentary Super-Size Me, which exposed the dangers of McDonald\u2019s and fast food, the concept of super-sizing a meal went rapidly down hill, resulting in the company pulling it from menus in 2004.\n\n  \u2022 5.\u00a0McGratin Croquette\n\n    The Daily Meal\n\n    While the U.S. market never had the pleasure of experiencing a McGratin Croquette, a patty made of deep-fried macaroni, potato, and shrimp, customers in Japan certainly did. It didn\u2019t last long on Japanese menus, and critics believed it was a combination of taste and poor marketing that led to its ultimate demise.\n\n    See more menu flops at The Daily Meal\n\n    More from The Daily Meal\n\n    New McDonald's Menu Items: Will They Flop?\n\n    America's Unhealthiest Fast-Food Items\n\n    Healthiest Menu Items at Fast-Food Chains\n\n    World's 10 Coolest McDonald's",
