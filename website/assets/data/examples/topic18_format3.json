Training takes 2 hours and attendance at the weekend Mass is 1 1\/2 hours.\n\nWhat We Do:\nOur ministry serves members and guests of St. John's at the weekend Masses. We minister to the members of St. John's by proclaiming the first and second readings of the Liturgy of the Word during the weekend liturgy. We also serve in the commentator role at the weekend liturgy.\n\nHelpful Attributes:\nAdults (youths for certain occasions) who are very self-confident and enjoy reading aloud with the talent of being able to project what they read clearly, distinctly and with meaning.\n\nContact Betsy Mantor\n\nFor many lectors and commentators, it may have been years since your original training session. While many aspects of the role may be unchanged since that first training session, it is a good idea to periodically refresh your understanding of the expectations of your role. In the Resource box to the right, you will find the following two\u00a0helpful\u00a0resources:\u00a0\n\nHelpful Hints\n\nThis document provides you information to prepare for proclaiming the Word or announcing the Mass.\n\n\nThis document provides a step-by-step guide to your actions before, during, and after the Mass. It also includes any responsibilities for special circumstances such as when there is not a deacon present.\n\nIf you are considering serving as a lector\/commentator, these documents may be helpful in discerning if this ministry is right for you.\n\n\nClick the resources in the box to the right to see helpful hints and step-by-step guide to being a Lector\/Commentator.",

        "text":"In the Uniting Church the majority of those baptised are little children, brought by their parents who want them to grow up in the Christian faith.\n\nHowever baptism can happen at any age. Teenagers and adults are baptised after a period of teaching, formation and reflection about the Christian faith and what joining the Church involves.\n\nIf you are not baptised and have questions about the Christian faith you can join an enquirers' group where you can ask some of the big questions...\n\n  \u2022 How do we know God?\n  \u2022 Why is Jesus' death important?\n  \u2022 What is the purpose of life?\n  \u2022 What is Christian discipleship?\n  \u2022 Why do people die?\n  \u2022 What happens after death?\n\nIf you are an adult and want to know more about the Christian faith or want to explore the possibility of baptism or Confirmation, please contact the Minister.\n\nInfant Baptism\n\nThe baptism of infants and children at Wesley Uniting Church, Geelong normally takes place during the Sunday service. In baptism, children are welcomed as members of the Church - i.e. the local and worldwide Christian family. Therefore, it is important that other members of the Church are present. For your child, baptism marks the start of a journey of faith.\n\nI'm not a regular churchgoer. Can I still have my child baptised?\n\nYes. The Church believes that God's love is available to all, regardless of their background.\u00a0\nThe Minister would be pleased to talk to you about the baptism of your child.\u00a0\nYou will be given a booklet called \"Your Baby's Baptism\". Topics covered include:\n\n  \u2022 Why baptism?\n  \u2022 Before the baptism\n  \u2022 Questions people ask\n  \u2022 The signs and symbols of baptism\n  \u2022 The baptism service\n  \u2022 You and God\n  \u2022 Helping your child to grow in Christian life\n  \u2022 Looking forward to Confirmation\n\nWe hope your baby's baptism will be a wonderful and memorable occasion and that it will mark the beginning of a long and happy association at Wesley Uniting Church Geelong.\n\nPlease contact the Church Office or the Minister on 5229 8866 who will be delighted to talk with you.",
