        "text":"Prayer Chaplains\n\nphoto of clasped handsOur prayer chaplains are here to pray with you\n\nWhat Is a prayer chaplain?\n\nOur prayer chaplains are committed to the sacred service of prayer.\n\nOur lead chaplains lead prayer during Sunday services and at Wednesday prayer hour. All our chaplains take time after Sunday Services to hold space and pray with individuals one on one.\n\nThe role of our prayer chaplains is, quite simply, to pray. Chaplains are not counselors or advice-givers.\n\nThe core of our prayer chaplains' commitment is to:\n\n  \u2022 Hold spiritual space\n  \u2022 Lovingly listen\n  \u2022 Pray from the heart\n  \u2022 Hold in confidence what is shared\n\nIt\u2019s a role that helps participants discover their connection with the Divine in everyone.\n\nMany of our prayer chaplains report that they stepped in to serve others, but found that being a prayer chaplain blessed and benefited them most of all. By giving of our time and maintaining a spiritual connection for the community, we get as much out of service as we give.\n\nHow do we pray?\n\nPrayer is one of Unity's Five Principles. It is a way of connecting with God and our Divine nature.\n\nUnity practices affirmative prayer. Affirmative prayer is the practice of seeing the highest and best in any given situation, regardless of its outer circumstances. In Unity, we see the divinity of each individual and understand that God is in all things.\n\nHow do our prayer chaplains serve our community?\n\nOur chaplains are available every Sunday after each service for one-on-one prayer time for all who desire it.\n\nOur lead chaplains provide congregational prayer during each Sunday service. They also hold sacred space in the sanctuary during the services and carry the prayer box up to the stage for a blessing during the offertory. In addition, they serve our Youth and Family Ministry by praying with the educational facilitators who teach the children on Sundays.\n\nEvery Wednesday evening at 7 p.m., the chaplains practice an hour of prayer for individuals, communities, situations and events across the world. It is our vision to see the best possible outcome of any situation that presents itself each prayer hour. Afterward, the prayers that were said that night, as well as the prayers put into the prayer box the previous week, are prayed for by our chaplains for 30 days. We also forward these prayers to Silent Unity, which will also hold the prayers for 30 days.\n\nWho can be a prayer chaplain?\n\nIf you hear the call to become a prayer chaplain, we encourage you to contact us. We offer training once a year.\n\nThroughout the year, prayer chaplains have many opportunities to serve, including after Sunday services, for special services, on Wednesdays for prayer hour, and during the World Day of Prayer.\n\nHow may we pray with you?\n\nDo you have a prayer request? Try using our\u00a0online prayer request form.\n\nThere are also several ways to contact Silent Unity, the 24\/7 prayer ministry:\n\nFor calls within the U.S.A.: 1-800-NOW-PRAY (669-7729)\n\nFor international calls: 01-816-969-2000\n\nWrite: Silent Unity, 1901 NW Blue Parkway, Unity Village, MO 64065-0001\n\n\n\n\nuPray mobile prayer app",

        "text":"Explore your faith\n\nThe normal process for a person exploring the possibility of becoming Catholic is called Christian Initiation, a combination of catechetical sessions and public rituals. The process, of no particular length of time, is structured considering the background and questions of the person, while providing a broadly based understanding of the Church. The goal is always to offer a thorough presentation of the Church\u2019s life and teaching to enable the person to make an informed decision about becoming Catholic.\n\nInterested in Learning about The Catholic Faith?\nPlease Contact:\u00a0 Deacon Bill Pettit, or Deacon Rick Martin, we will be glad to meet with those interested in finding our more about the Catholic faith.\u00a0 Please contact either of our Deacons above to set up a convenient time to meet to talk about the Catholic Faith and the process at Immaculate Conception.\u00a0 We welcome your inquiry and look forward to talking to those interested in finding out more about Catholicism.\n\nNo registration is required. At these gatherings in the fall and winter, members of the Initiation Ministries Team listen to the inquirer, doing their best to answer initial questions. They also share their own experiences of coming to relationship with Christ and being involved in the life of the Church. The Inquirer is always free to decide to return to the next session, to postpone, or to end the process.\n\nIf an Inquirer continues in the process through the celebration of the first public ritual, a sponsor will be assigned to continue the journey with the catechumen, a previously unbaptized person, or the candidate, one baptized previously in another faith tradition.",

TimePreschoolVBS\n\nOur Nursery is available:\n\nSunday: 9:30 & 10:45 a.m., 5:30 p.m\n\nLagrange Baptist\u2019s Nursery Ministry seeks to intentionally plant seeds of biblical truth into the hearts of the little ones among us. Children (birth \u2013 pre-2\u2019s) will be provided with a safe and loving environment where teachers and helpers will begin to lay the groundwork of who God is through prayer, singing, reading and purposeful playing.\n\nWe consider this time with little ones a great blessing. Some have viewed nursery as simple \u201cbaby-sitting,\u201d but it is much more than that. In the nursery, the love of God is on display as people care for little ones and pour out love and compassion. This cultivates a sense of security and communicates to the kids that they are a delight, not a burden. The joy of serving in the nursery is the joy of giving God glory by training up the next generation in the ways of our Lord. In fact, Jesus was angry and corrected his disciples when they thought He didn\u2019t have time for little ones:\n\nSome people were bringing little children to Him so He might touch them, but His disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw it, He was indignant and said to them, \u201cLet the little children come to Me. Don\u2019t stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. I assure you: Whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\u201d After taking them in His arms, He laid His hands on them and blessed them. \u2013 Mark 10:13-16\n\nThis is a ministry that is always in need of workers.\nIf you desire to serve in our church nursery,\nplease\u00a0contact Pastor Ryan.\n\nPlease read\u00a0this article\u00a0that helps us remember the value of ministering in the nursery.\n\nNursery Policies\n\n*To help you become acquainted with the nursery and its policies, please take a moment to read through the following information, and please keep this bookmark this page for your future reference.\u00a0\n\nWhen You Arrive\u2026\n\n1. The nursery opens 15 minutes before the Worship Service.\n\n2. Children stay in the same room for one year. Every September we promote the children. Toddlers will be promoted in October to the \u201cPre-2\u201d & \u201c2 yr. old\u201d classes. This is determined by birth month and year.\n\n3. Newborns are welcome in our nursery. You do not have to wait until they are 6 or 8 weeks old to leave them in the nursery. Whenever you are ready, you many fill out an information form.\n\n4. Due to the crowded hallways and rooms, we ask that only one person drop off and pick up your child.\n\nCheck In Procedure\n\nEach week when you check in, you will be asked to fill out a\u00a0security sticker\u00a0and a\u00a0parent sign-in\u00a0sheet. You will also receive a pager. Your child\u2019s Diaper Bag will have a corresponding tag.\n\n1. Please fill out the information on the sign-in sheet completely. Write your name and specific location, and the pager # on the parent sign-in sheet.\n\n2. Write your child\u2019s name, any specific instructions, and your pager # on the sticker. Attach the sticker to the child\u2019s back.\n\n3. The Diaper bag tag should match the pager #, and be placed on the diaper bag.\n\n4. The parent keeps the pager. The pager must be turned in when picking up your child. If \u00a0someone else is to pick up your child, they must have the pager. Siblings may pick up a child if they are at least middle school age.\n\n5. The parent must be on the church campus at all times.\n\n6. In the event that you lose the pager, or another person has it, please go to the Nursery. The nursery caregivers will not release your child without proper authorization. Your child\u2019s safety is our first priority, even if it requires extra time.\n\n\n1. Worker : child ratios have been established for your child\u2019s safety and are as follows:\n\n  \u2022 Infants \u2013 1:3\n  \u2022 Toddlers \u2013 1:4\n  \u2022 Two Year Olds \u2013 1:5\n\n2. Children will not be accepted into the rooms until the adults scheduled to work that hour are present and the ratios are met.\n\n3. The Nursery is staffed entirely by volunteers. The number of children we can care for is totally dependant on the number of volunteers we have. On some occasions, you many not be able to leave your child in the nursery due to a lack of workers. It is for this reason that we encourage all parents to serve as volunteers in the Children\u2019s Ministry.\n\nCheck Out\n\n1. Parents must have the pager to pick up their child. If the\u00a0pager has been lost, please go to the Nursery as soon as possible.\n\n2. Tell your child\u2019s name and show the nursery volunteer your pager, but DO NOT hand them the pager. The volunteer will go into the room and bring out your child and diaper bag. At that time, you may give the nursery volunteer your pager and remove the security sticker off your child and diaper bag.\n\n3. Due to congestion in the rooms and hallways, we request that only one parent pick up the child.\n\n4. Siblings must be in middle school or older before they can pick up nursery-age children. They must also have the pager to turn into the nursery.\n\nHelpful Hints\n\nSometimes, especially during the early years, there may be a difficult period of adjustment for your child. They may not want to stay in their room without you. Be patient. Continue to leave your child. Taking the child to the adult service or staying home only postpones the problem.\u00a0 Reassurance, plenty of love and consistent attendance will often take care of the problem.\n\nIt is not necessary for you to \u201ccheck\u201d on your child. If your child does not settle down in 10-15 minutes, or if we need to page you, your pager will alarm you. The nursery staff will be delighted to talk with you, and work with you and your child.\n\nYour Stay With Us\n\nIn an effort to make your child\u2019s stay in the nursery as pleasant and safe as possible, we ask that you help us in the following ways.\n\nSuggested Diaper Bag Contents\n\n1. A small diaper bag or sack that will easily fit in the nursery cubbyhole.\n\n2. One or two bottles or \u201csippy-cups\u201d as needed (permanently labeled with your child\u2019s full name). Please do not put milk products in sippy cups, as this protects those children with milk allergies.\n\n3. Extra disposable diapers.\n\n4. Pacifier (clip-on type or labeled, please)\n\n5. Change of clothes\n\nWhat NOT to Bring\n\n1. Do not bring medicine of any kind. If your child needs any medication at all, it MUST be kept by and administered by the parent.\n\n2. Please do not bring toys from home. They may get lost if they are mixed in with the nursery toys. We provide safe toys that are cleaned every week.\n\n3. The nursery is comfortably equipped with blankets, burping cloths, etc. It is not necessary to bring these items from home. It is often difficult to track down the items that belong to your child.\n\n4. Please to not bring infant carriers, car seats, and\/or strollers into the nursery. We do not have the room to store them.\n\n5. We will provide\u00a0Animal Crackers & Cheese crackers. Please do not send additional food. Other children in the class will gravitate to your child\u2019s snack. Even the presence of peanut butter inside a child\u2019s bag can prove to be extremely dangerous to some children\u2019s allergies.\n\n6. We provide\u00a0water\u00a0at snack time. Please do not send beverages, especially milk products, in sippy cups.\n\nLabel All Belongings\n\n1. Please label all bottles and pacifiers.\n\n2. Please tie a string to the pacifiers and pin them to your child\u2019s clothing.\n\n3. All blankets should have your child\u2019s name on them so that they are not confused with the nursery supply.\n\n4. All coats and jackets should be labeled with your child\u2019s name. The Security Sticker should be placed directly on the child.\n\nFeeding Your Child\n\n1. A nursing room is available in the nursery area.\n\n2. We will do our best to give bottle-fed babies their bottle at the time you indicate. Please write specific instructions on the Security Sticker placed on your child.\n\n3. Since powdered formulas vary, we ask that you mix up all bottles before you come.\n\n4.\u00a0We ask that you feed your child their baby\/solid food before you come. If your child must be fed solid food during the service, it may be necessary to page you.\n\n5. We do provide animal crackers, cheese crackers, and water each hour for children over 6 months of age. Please do not send additional food, gum, or beverages.\n\n6. If your child is allergic to anything on the snack list, please tell the workers every time you check in. Write \u201cNo Crackers\u201d on the Special Instructions space on your child\u2019s Security Sticker.\n\n7. The Quiet Room should not be used for feeding children of any age.\n\nDiaper Changing\n\n1. Please bring an extra disposable diaper each time you come. The one time you think you won\u2019t need it, you will.\n\n2. We make the effort to check and\/or change every child every hour. If you need to change your child, please do so in the nursery.\n\n3. The Quiet Room is not for this purpose.\n\n\n1. In consideration of others, please do not bring sick children to the Nursery or to the Quiet Room. Your child must be free from colds, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, pinkeye, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours before coming to the Nursery or to the Quiet Room.\n\n2. If your child becomes ill or injured during the service, the Nursery Staff will determine\u00a0 whether to notify you immediately or wait until the hour is over.\n\n3. All medication must be administered by parents.\n\nLost and Found\n\nThe lost and found is located behind the counter at Check In. Please check there or in your child\u2019s room for missing items.\n\nFire Alarm\n\nIf the fire alarm should go off during the service, please do not come to the nursery. The nursery caregiver\u2019s primary concern is to get the children out of the area safely. During the fire alarm, the children WILL NOT be released to the parents until calm has been restored and security tags can be checked properly.\n\nNursery Caregivers\n\nOur ministry team and volunteers are here to pray for your child, play with them, and read to them every time they are with us in the Nursery. We desire for your child to want to come to church, and to learn truths about God. As o... (truncated)",

This often happens when someone who was not baptised as a child comes to faith in Jesus Christ. \u00a0\n\nFor babies and small children, bringing your child for baptism means that you wish them to be part of God's family and will help them take their part in the life and worship of the church. \u00a0You make promises on your behalf and on behalf of your child. \u00a0Baptism marks the start of a journey of faith for your child in which they will grow in knowledge and experience, learning to turn away from the wrong\u00a0and turn towards Christ.\n\nBaptisms at St. Peter's are normally held on\u00a0the 4th Sunday of each month at 12 noon.\u00a0More information on Baptism can be found on the\u00a0Church of England website.\n\nTo find out more please contact\u00a0Val Lynam, see us after a Sunday morning service, or come to\u00a0First Steps\u00a0on a Thursday morning. \u00a0Someone from St Peter's will then visit you to explain more about Thanksgiving and Baptism and help you choose which service is right for your child\n\n\n\nPrinter\u00a0Printable Version",

The truth is that money is morally neutral, but what we do with our money reveals something much deeper \u2014 what\u2019s in our hearts (Matthew 6:21). God is the creator and owner of everything, so we are merely stewards of His stuff (1 Chronicles 29:14).\n\nRemnant encourages members and regular attenders to follow the Biblical model of giving cheerfully (2 Corinthians 9:7) and sacrificially (Psalm 4:5). Contributing financially to the work of the church out of our \u201cfirstfruits\u201d is both a renunciation of greed as an idol and an acknowledgement that all we have been given is given to us by God and is to be used for his purposes (Matthew 25:14-30). It is an expression of worship in response to all that God has done in our midst.",

The Mural was created with the assistance of art teacher Sylvie Allard and her students.\n\nSpiritual Accompaniment\n\nPatricia Aldred\nSpiritual Care and Guidance and Community Involvement Animator\nEmail: paldred@lbpsb.qc.ca\n\nThe Spiritual Care and Community Involvement Service offers spiritual accompaniment to student facing the death of a loved one.\n\nWhat is Spiritual Accompaniment?\n\nThe spiritual animator is an integral member of the school\u2019s Student Services team. They work as part of a multi-disciplinary team, coordinating efforts with the professionals and administration to better meet the needs of the student population.\n\nThe question of what type of relationship the spiritual animator has with students is paramount in distinguishing his\/her role in the Student Services team and their professional boundaries with students. In one to one interventions, the animator attempts to address the spiritual, emotional and religious needs of the student as these aspects of life contribute to and are part of the student\u2019s reality. Quality in spiritual animation means a service which is available, accessible, spiritual in focus, and respectful of particular expressions of faith and cultural traditions.\n\nThe role of the \u201caccompanier\u201d best captures what is the animator\u2019s relationship to the student body. This would mean the spiritual animator would be trained in the area of active listening. It is vital to simply be present during times of difficulty. The role of the animator is not to mentor students according to his or her own sense of what is right. The role of the animator is to listen, to seek out students who are suffering and non-judgmentally accompany them through their difficulty. This includes, but is not limited to the areas of bereavement support, family crisis, self -esteem, stress management.\n\nAs such, the spiritual animator\u2019s role and responsibilities would often overlap with other professionals including the Guidance Counselor, Social Worker, Psychologist, Special Education Technician, etc. As a member of the Student Services Team, the animator would be able to coordinate his\/her efforts with other professionals and administration to better meet the needs of the school community. It should be made clear that the spiritual animator does not do long term counseling or therapy with students. When a particular situation with a student comes up and is clearly beyond the skills of the animator, it is the animator\u2019s responsibility to refer the student to a qualified professional with the expertise appropriate to the situation. \u00a0\n\n\nBereavement Support\n\nSeveral support groups for bereaved students are also run in collaboration with other members of the Pierrefonds Comprehensive Student Services Team. The group is a confidential and voluntary body with between 3 to 6 members that meets for six session.\n\nThe expectation is that the group would focus primarily on the future and would help each member learn to move forward despite the loss, the pain and the major changes each has experienced. Although the group will explore painful issues surrounding bereavement, the facilitators endeavour to ensure that such discussion be safe and gentle. The group is sensitive to letting the individual students set the agenda and no one is made to feel they have to say something.\n\nslide up button",
