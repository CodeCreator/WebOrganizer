Instructors will warm-up students with exercises that increase flexibility and strengthen the cardiovascular, muscular, and mental aspects of growing bodies. Classes visit all four Olympic events (bars, beam, floor, and vault), and will also spend time on trampolines and visit the foam pit throughout each session. Classes support social, cerebral, and physical development, but also encourage a love of physical fitness. Classes are carefully designed progressively with each new level building on the skills mastered in the level before it, helping to ensure safe development and build self-confidence.\nOlympia's classes are not done by skill level but age so we have kids that develop friendships and peer development. Coaches evaluate students skills and will adjust the skill they are doing on the event accordingly. \u00a0Coaches will coach each student as they progress, not the entire class as a whole.\nEvaluations are ongoing and tracked by staff during week 8 & 9, and progress updates are sent out at the end of the session of each term to provide feedback for parents.\u00a0 To maximize each child\u2019s advancement in his or her physical education, Olympia Gymnastics advises year-round enrollment in more than one class each week.",
