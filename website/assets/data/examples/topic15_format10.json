        "text":"Global installed base of wireless IoT devices in industrial automation topped 21.3mn in 2018\n\nFredrik St\u00e5lbrand of Berg Insight\n\nAccording to a new research report from the M2M\/IoT analyst firm Berg Insight, annual shipments of wireless devices for industrial automation applications reached 4.6 million units worldwide in 2018. This\u00a0accounts\u00a0for approximately 6%\u00a0of all new connected nodes.\n\nGrowing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3%, annual shipments are expected to reach 9.9 million in 2023. The installed base of wireless IoT devices in industrial automation reached at the same time 21.3 million in 2018.\n\nWhile wired networking solutions are still predominantly used for industrial communications between sensors, controllers and systems, wireless solutions have gained a strong foothold in a number of applications. Wireless solutions are used for wire replacement in parts of the plant that are hard to reach or uneconomical to connect through wired installations. In factory automation, wireless solutions are widely used to control cranes and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in material handling applications.\n\nIn process automation, wireless technologies are increasingly used to connect instruments, enabling plant operators to monitor and optimise processes in hazardous areas, while also ensuring worker safety. Major providers of wired industrial network equipment also offer wireless solutions to enable customers to monitor and control devices wirelessly in parts of the plant that are normally not connected to the control room due to accessibility or wiring costs.\n\nThese include Siemens, Cisco, Belden, Moxa and Phoenix Contact, which all offer comprehensive portfolios of industrial wireless devices such as routers, gateways and wireless access points along their wired solutions. Industrial wireless solutions are also offered by many mid and small-sized companies, which often specialise in specific product categories.\n\nExamples include Acksys, Advantech, Beijer Electronics Group, FreeWave Technologies, GE\u2019s industrial communications group GE MDS, HMS Networks, Red Lion Controls and Sierra Wireless. Wireless I\/O and field devices are provided by many major industrial automation vendors including Emerson, Yokogawa, Honeywell, ABB, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Endress+Hauser and Pepperl+Fuchs.\n\n\u201cRobust connectivity is critical to support industrial IoT use cases surrounding predictive maintenance and digital twins,\u201d says\u00a0Fredrik St\u00e5lbrand, IoT Analyst, Berg Insight. He adds that installation and maintenance of wireless solutions are more flexible and economical compared to wired technologies, enabling reconfigurable manufacturing system design.\n\nAlthough reliability and security remain a challenge, Wi-Fi has emerged as the most widely used wireless technology in industrial environments largely due to the wide availability of compatible hardware. There is also a growing trend among large industrial companies to deploy private 4G LTE networks instead of using Wi-Fi and even wired solutions.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of 5G cellular technologies broadens the addressable market for wireless communications even further as it allows for deployments in situations where requirements related to bandwidth, latency and capacity cannot be fulfilled today,\u201d concludes\u00a0Mr. St\u00e5lbrand.\n\nComment on this article below or via\u00a0Twitter: @IoTNow_OR\u00a0@jcIoTnow\n\nRecent Articles\n\nTrusted Connectivity Alliance welcomes success of integrated SIM standardisation\n\nPosted on: May 6, 2021\n\nThe Trusted Connectivity Alliance (TCA) has published a new paper welcoming global standardisation efforts that have evolved integrated SIM functionality.\n\nRead more\n\n1 in 5 data breaches are caused by misconfigured clouds, says survey\n\nPosted on: May 6, 2021\n\nTo accommodate remote work and improve efficiency,\u00a085% of IT organisations\u00a0are considering or already using the public cloud.\n\nRead more",

Only some paramedics wearing masks were able to enter the shaft, authorities said.\n\n\"The shaft of the mine has been severely destroyed, making our rescue work very hard,\" Li, the rescuer, said.\n\nRescuers had pulled six miners alive out of the mine as of 6 a.m. Thursday.\n\nYang Dongliang, head of the State Administration of Work Safety, arrived at the mine early Thursday morning to join provincial governor Jiang Jufeng in directing rescue operations.\n\nFinding and rescuing those miners trapped underground has remained a pressing task, according to the rescue headquarters.\n\nA total of 154 miners were working underground when the accident occurred at around 6 p.m. Wednesday, and 107 of them have escaped on their own or have been pulled out of the shaft, according to the rescue headquarters. Three miners died on their way to hospital.\n\nAs of 6 p.m. Thursday, four hospitals in Panzhihua had received 54 miners, including 10 who were seriously injured and seven in critical condition, sources with the provincial health department said.\n\nOf the injured, 50 suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning and the other four miners suffered burn-related injuries, the sources said, adding that most of them are in stable condition.\n\nXu Changyong, 34, was one of the miners who survived the accident.\n\nHe regained consciousness after being taken to the Panzhihua Coal Mine Employee General Hospital.\n\n\"I heard the crackling sound of an explosion at that time but didn't feel the shockwave,\" Xu told Xinhua at the hospital. \"What came out of the air compressor was not fresh air but ash, and soon my workmates and I got headaches.\"\n\nXu, a digging miner with strong sense of safety, quickly got the pipe off the air compressor to let fresh air in after he realized there must have been a gas blast and helped his four workmates escape. Xu scrambled out of the pit, but lost consciousness on the way to hospital.\n\nThe coal mine, some 750 km southwest of the provincial capital Chengdu, is owned by Zhengjin Industry and Trade Co., Ltd.\n\nThree owners of the mine have been taken into police custody and the mine's accounts have been frozen.\n\nAn investigation into the accident is underway.\n\nMeanwhile, provincial authorities have ordered a thorough probe and overhaul on coal mines and other potentially hazardous enterprises.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 claims the copyright of all material and information produced originally by our staff.

This reflects the National Minimum Wage and will rise to \u00a36.21 when the Agricultural Wages Order is applied from October 1 this year.\n\nNFU lead negotiator Bob Fiddaman said: \u201cThese were particularly tough negotiations. Recent years have seen contrasting fortunes across agricultural sectors, creating a challenge for the board to agree on an industry-wide figure. For example, the fortunes of combinable crops and horticulture have diverged over the last 12 months, whilst milk price cuts have dominated recent headlines. In addition, we know that agricultural profitability is strongly related to currency, with concerns over the current Eurozone problems also a factor.\u201d\n\nNFU chief economist Phil Bicknell urged farmers to take note of the new rates. \u201cAt present, the timeframe regarding the abolition of the AWB remains unclear. Certainly for 2012, farm businesses employing workers should be aware of the new minimum rates applicable from October. However, as many of the 40,000 farms employing workers across England and Wales will know, it is local market conditions and competition that increasingly determine actual pay rates rather than the minimums set by the AWB.\u201d\n\nThe NFU represents the employers\u2019 interests at the AWB negotiations. Workers are represented by Unite the Union, and the board also includes government appointed representatives as independent arbitrators.\n\nThePoultrySite News Desk\n\nRelated News\n\nOur Sponsors\n\n\nSeasonal Picks\n\nPoultry Breeds and Management",

During January this year, the project was producing at around 20,000 bopd, which analysts at investment banking firm Jefferies noted was \u2018double the guided expectation\u2019 at that point.\n\nPremier recorded production of 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2017, which was slightly higher than its 2016 output of 71,400 boepd. The company reported cash flows $496 million from operations during the year, which was up 15 percent on 2016, as well as a positive free cash flow of $71.2 million and a reduction of net debt to $2.7 billion. EBITDAX also increased to $589.7 million in 2017, up from $494.1 million in 2016.\n\nIn a brief research note sent to Rigzone, oil and gas analysts at GMP FirstEnergy described Premier Oil\u2019s latest update as \u2018positive\u2019, stating that the company\u2019s financials were \u2018in line\u2019.\n\n\u201c2017 was a successful year for Premier,\u201d Tony Durrant, Premier Oil chief executive, said in a company statement.\n\n\u201c2018 will see further production growth, allowing us to deliver on our plans for reducing net debt to restore balance sheet strength while also progressing projects that deliver the highest financial returns,\u201d he added.\n\nGenerated by readers, the comments included herein do not reflect the views and opinions of Rigzone.

        "text":"PSB Asks Utilities to Reexamine Vermont Yankee Deal\n\n02\/26\/02 12:00AM By John Dillon\n\n(Host) It's decision time once again for the owners of the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant. Last summer, the Vermont utilities that own the reactor agreed to sell it to a Louisiana energy company for $180 million.\n\nBut utility regulators recently asked them to re-evaluate that decision in light of new forecasts that show lower prices for power in New England. On Monday, the regulators again asked the utilities to slow down on the deal.\n\nVPR's John Dillon reports.\n\n(Dillon) The Yankee deal requires utilities to buy back the power for 10 years. But new forecasts show prices may drop as other power plants come online. The studies have raised questions about whether it still makes sense for the companies to lock into that long-term Yankee contract.\n\nEarlier this month, the Public Service Board, which regulates power companies, told the utilities to reconsider the sale. The PSB wants the utilities' boards of directors to study the latest data and reconsider whether the sale and the power contract are still good for the state's ratepayers.\n\nNew testimony was due Monday in the case. If the sale was no longer a good idea, the companies would have to tell the PSB in its testimony.\n\nBut Steve Costello, a spokesman for Central Vermont Public Service Corporation, says that the company's Board didn't have time to study all the latest information by Monday's deadline:\n\n(Costello) \"They were briefed this morning during a regular board meeting and got a lot of information. But because there's just volumes of information and vast amounts of information, they weren't prepared to make a decision and will reconvene on Friday after they've had some time to deliberate and look at the information in depth. And at that time, they'll make a final decision.\"\n\n(Dillon) It's unusual for the Public Service Board in the middle of a case to ask power companies for such a fundamental reexamination of the issues. PSB Chairman Michael Dworkin told the utilities to look at the new data and make \"a real business decision\" about whether the deal was still worth it.\n\nJames Dumont, a lawyer for anti-nuclear groups, says the PSB order is unusual, but appropriate. Dumont says the utilities also want something unusual out of the PSB. He says the companies are asking for a legal ruling that says costs from the 10-year power contract can be passed on to ratepayers:\n\n(Dumont) \"What the companies want from the Board is extraordinary - it's unheard of. \u00bf And the Board is simply responding to this extraordinary request from the utilities. What the utilities are saying is that they're not going to go forward unless the Board guarantees them in the future that they're going to get all their costs back from ratepayers in rates that have to do from this sale.\"\n\n(Dillon) Hearings on the Yankee case are scheduled to resume in March. Meanwhile, the state agency that represents ratepayers and the utilities are negotiating on a possible settlement.\n\nFor Vermont Public Radio, I'm John Dillon.\n\ncomments powered by Disqus\nSupported By\nBecome an Underwriter | Find an Underwiter",

(Image source: Pexels\/Pixabay)Dangote Rice, a subsidiary of Dangote Group, is set to launch 25,000 ha of rice outgrower scheme in Sokoto with a prospect of hundreds of thousands of employment opportunities for the rural communities inhabitants\n\nPresident of the Group, Aliko Dangote disclosed at the weekend that the company flag off with a pilot project of 500 ha by Gonroyo dam, in Goronyo community. The flag off ceremony, which is to be performed by the governor of the state, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwa, will witness seedlings being distributed to the primary local farmers who will in turn plant the seed after which Dangote Rice company will purchase it from them for milling and final processing.\n\nSokoto state is the second after Jigawa out of the 14 states spread across the state where Dangote Rice plans to operate outgrower scheme to empower local farmers and create job opportunities for community dwellers and reduce migration to the cities.\n\nDangote Rice projects in the 14 states is expected to generate a significant number of jobs and increase take-home income for smallholder farmers, all while diversifying Nigeria\u2019s economy and reducing the nation\u2019s food import bill when operational.\n\nBy year-end 2017, Dangote Rice plans to produce 225,000 mt of parboiled, milled white rice. This will allow us to satisfy four per cent of the total market demand within one year. According to the organisation, the model can then be successfully scaled to produce 1,000,000 mt of milled rice in order to satisfy 16 per cent of the domestic market demand for rice over the next five years.\n\nThrough the Dangote Rice Outgrower Scheme, DRL will partner with outgrowers (smallholder and contract rice farmers) to cultivate and grow rice paddy. Specifically, DRL will provide inputs, technical assistance, extension services and land preparation services and equipment directly to farmers. At harvest, DRL will recoup the costs of inputs and services in-kind and will act as a guaranteed offtaker for paddy that meets certain pre-agreed quality standards. Smallholder farmers will provide land and labour.\n\nAlain Charles Publishing, University House, 11-13 Lower Grosvenor Place, London, SW1W 0EX, UK\nT: +44 20 7834 7676, F: +44 20 7973 0076, W:\u00a0www.alaincharles.com\n\ntwn Are you sure that you want to switch to desktop version?",

The Dillion Wind Power Project in North Palm Springs is now complete.\n\n45 new wind turbines, each standing more than 200 feet tall, will now provide valley residents with 45 megawatts of clean, green, renewable energy. This is enough power for more than 13,000 valley homes.\n\n\u201cIt reduces the emissions that would be the equivalent of taking 11,000 cars off the road,\u201d said Jan Johnson of IBERDROLA RENEWABLES Dillon Wind Power Project.\n\nThe project spreads across 15,000 acres and, project officials say, only impacts less than 2% of that area\u2019s habitats.\n\n\u201cI love them. I\u2019m very green, energy is great, we need them,\u201dsaid Lee Cohen who owns Windmill Market, down the street from the windmills. He says his business depends on windmill traffic, he welcomes the new giant additions.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of employees, everyone driving through, they are happy to come here, and they like the name too,\u201d Cohen added as he sent his loyal customers on their way.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with this project, some people feel it is not necessary for the windmills to be built in the North Palm Springs area.\n\n\u201cI think they are kind of annoying, honestly. If they want to build more property they are going to get in the way, especially since the estates are adding more villages,\u201d said Desert Hot Springs resident Lindsey Fenoglio, who lives down the street from the new turbines.\n\nAnd there were other concerns against Dillon Wind, some residents that face the windmills everyday feel they should get their electricity rates lowered.\n\n\u201cWe take windmill development very seriously, we want to have the minimum impact on all forms of life, wildlife as well as our own communities,\u201d Johnson told KPSP.\n\nWindmills, a Coachella Valley landmark, now bigger and greener, yet still spinning up controversy in the west valley.\n\nThe windmills will provide power to Southern California Edison.\n\nBy Mary Hensley\nKPSP Local 2 News\n\n\n30 May 2008\n\nThis article is the work of the source indicated.

Twelve-year-old PD Miller exhibited in the youth market beef show at NWSS this year for the first time. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0As reserve champion, Miller received a banner and a $1,000 scholarship. He was also named the Champion Junior Premier Beef Exhibitor, which is for competitors under age 13. Miller said he is very proud of the honors and the fact that he and his family raised the Maine Anjou Chianina crossbred, \u201cSmokin Joe,\u201d from a baby calf.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0After placing third out of 15 steers in his junior market beef class with the 1,310-pound steer, Miller was eligible to participate for the Premier Beef Exhibitor award.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The contest is open to junior exhibitors nine to 19 years of age who qualified to sell in the Junior Livestock Champions auction at NWSS. Individuals from all over the United States traveled to Denver to compete in the event. The Premier Beef Exhibitor Champion was Claire Galley, 18, of DeQuincy, La.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Miller explains that the premier beef exhibitor contest is divided into five categories of competition and the individual with the highest total score wins the event. The categories were: live and carcass placings of the beef, a quiz containing general questions about the cattle industry, a prepared speech and a personal interview.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Miller says after he placed third with Smokin Joe he attended the exhibitors\u2019 meeting that afternoon, during which he took his quiz and was given his speech topic. The next morning at 8 a.m., Miller gave a two-minute presentation on, \u201cDo you think the show cattle industry is a good representation of the beef industry as a whole and what is your role as an exhibitor?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The speech was followed by an interview with a judge about his quiz and the beef industry as a whole. Miller scored an 80 percent on his quiz, which was the second highest score of the 30 youth competing in the contest. Miller says the 25-question multiple choice quiz was a challenge. \u201cThe hardest part of the contest was the quiz,\u201d Miller says. \u201cYou have to have cows and be around them to know the answers to a lot of the questions.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA lot of the questions on the quiz I knew from participating in meat and livestock judging in 4-H,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Miller also has cows of his own and helps his family with their feedlot, which he says helped him with the contest. \u201cThe premier exhibitor contest is based on knowledge and ability and being able to speak,\u201d he adds.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0After Smokin Joe was sold in the NWSS Junior Livestock Sale of Champions, carcass data was collected and tabulated with the rest of the scores. The steer tied for third in the carcass value portion of the contest. Miller\u2019s mother, Christine, says, \u201cThe judge said the two steers that placed above Smokin Joe (in the live contest) were prettier, but he thought Smokin Joe would probably have better carcass value. I guess he was right.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0After all the scores were tabulated, Miller\u2019s total score was only .08 of a point below the overall champion. Next year, Miller says he hopes he can qualify to compete in the event again. His goal is to eventually win the contest. \u201cI hope to compete again if I do well enough with my steer,\u201d he says.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Although he competed for the first time in the youth market beef show this year, Miller is no stranger to the NWSS show ring. For the past five years he has competed in the open breeding heifer show and the prospect heifer show. At Denver he did well in those areas as well.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0His heifer, Izzy, was the champion prospect market heifer and his two breeding prospect heifers, Lila and Nikko, both finished first in their classes. Miller is also very proud of how his heifers performed at the show. \u201cI would like to keep showing Izzy in the market heifer division at shows, but I hope to add her to my cow herd,\u201d he says.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0When the Torrington Middle School student isn\u2019t busy with his cattle, he also enjoys playing on the traveling basketball and football teams. He is a five-year member of the Prairie Center 4-H Club and participates in the swine and beef projects. But cattle seem to be his true passion. \u201cMy goal is to own 50 cows by the time I go to college,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to win the livestock judging events at the shows in Denver, Kansas City and Louisville.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Cattle are truly a family affair in the Miller household. In addition to PD, Paul Jr. and Christine have two other children, Skyler, 10, and Paige, 7.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The cattle are a chore the entire family enjoys. Christine says her children have grown up helping with the cow-calf operation, the show cattle and the feedlot. \u201cOur boys grew up with it,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey started halter breaking calves when they were three. We couldn\u2019t keep them out of the pen.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe show cattle are a hobby, but it is also a family business,\u201d Christine says. \u201cWe buy and sell show cattle. They help pay the bills.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0To be successful at it, the family travels around the country to various shows and sales throughout the year. \u201cWe travel as a family and we show cattle as a family,\u201d she says. \u201cWe push our kids a lot. We push them to do it right the first time and to keep doing things right,\u201d she says. \u201cIn our family, we have a rule. At the big national shows, if it is their animal, they show it. Sometimes, they have been the youngest exhibitor in the ring in the open shows, but they are out there with the best and it teaches them a lot.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Gayle Smith is a correspondent for the Wyoming Livestock Roundup.",

        "text":"Home \/ Knowledge \/ News \/ Textiles \/ Cotton futures market faces rollercoaster ride\nCotton futures market faces rollercoaster ride\nSep '10\nNY futures gained additional ground this week, as December advanced 141 points to close at 97.17 cents, while March added 165 points to close at 96.38 cents.\n\nThe futures market has been on a rollercoaster ride this week, with December first climbing to a new high of 103.34 cents on Wednesday, only to collapse by over 600 points since then. A correction had been long overdue after the market's parabolic rise of 30 cents in just two months, but it was anybody's guess when and at what level it would occur.\n\nWe have previously talked about the dynamics behind a bull market and what signs we need to be looking for in order to spot a potential top in the making. Speculators were sponsoring the early phase of this bull market, as they piled into cotton in an impressive manner during the first 20 cents of the advance. By the time the December contract was trading at 93 cents, open interest had increased by over 70'000 contracts or nearly 50%, as speculators large and small wanted to own a part of this bullish story.\n\nHowever, over the last couple of weeks we have seen a pronounced slowdown in spec buying and during the last 10 cents of the rally open interest went up by less than 10'000 contracts. Speculators were no longer the driving force and instead we were now seeing a lot of trade-to-trade activity. While some trade shorts were forced to make defensive plays by buying calls or call spreads, others were apparently still able to sell into the rally, because we have yet to see a net reduction in the trade net short position as reported by the CFTC.\n\nAlso, for the first time during this rally we saw a sizeable amount of mill fixations, which may have helped to propel the market over the dollar mark. As of last Friday, unfixed on-call sales had dropped by a seemingly uneventful 279 contracts net to 105'153 contracts, or 10.51 million bales.\n\nLooking at the details though we notice that December on-call sales dropped by 854 contracts net, while the number for March was down by 1'216 contracts net. This means that there were at least 200'000 bales fixed, but probably a lot more, since these are net numbers. In other words, there may have been 300'000 bales in new sales added on December and March, while 500'000 bales were fixed.\n\nThis is certainly plausible when we look at the latest US export sales report, which shows that another 576'700 running bales of Upland and Pima were sold last week, of which 55'300 bales were for the next marketing year. For the current season commitments now amount to around 8.5 million statistical bales, of which only a little more than 1.3 million bales have so far been shipped. This low shipment number is entirely due to a lack of cotton in the pipeline and will rapidly increase once the crop becomes available.\n\nSpeaking of the crop, the harvest in the Mid-South and Southeast has been progressing very rapidly under hot and dry conditions and early indications arepromising in regards to yield and quality. The early arrival of the US crop is definitely playing a role in this correction. While conditions for the Delta still look fine for next week, the Southeast may not be as lucky since some meteorologists call for very wet and stormy conditions to arrive early next week. Hopefully a large part of the Southeast crop will be in modules by then.\n\nMust ReadView All\n\nTextiles minister Smriti Irani at a press conference with minister of state for textiles, Ajay Tamta, the principal director general (M&C), PIB, AP Frank Noronha and other dignitaries.

        "text":"PCA, CLAC speak up to oppose closed tendering in Sault. Ste. Marie\n\ncivic centre sault ste marie\nRendering of the Sault. Ste. Marie civic centre\n\nOrganizations representing the construction industry\u2019s businesses and labour outside of the conventional organized labour system are asking Sault Ste. Marie\u2019s city council to support a motion from Coun. Matthew Shoemaker to look deeper into the costs and impact that\u00a0 closed tendering is having on its citizens and finances.\n\nUnder current rules, the city can only allow contractors that are signatories of two unions\u2014the International Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and the Labourers International Union of North America\u2014to work on municipal projects.\n\nSault taxpayers are being over charged by as much as 30 per cent each year for construction projects, according to the Progressive Contractors Association of Canada (PCA).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of good research that shows Sault taxpayers are getting soaked on every single city construction project,\u201d said PCA spokesperson Karen Renkema. \u201cWhen local taxpayers are paying between 20 to 30 per cent more than they should for local projects there\u2019s something seriously wrong. It\u2019s about time that changed.\u201d\n\nOntario\u2019s outdated labour laws make construction work more expensive in the Sault by forcing the city to award all projects to contractors affiliated with two unions only, PCA says \u201cAny local companies and workers who aren\u2019t affiliated with those unions are not allowed to bid or work on the projects, no matter how qualified they are. Research from the Cardus think tank shows this lack of competition drives up construction costs in the Sault by as much as 20 to 30 percent each year \u2013 with taxpayers footing the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe $6.5 million civic centre facelift is a perfect example of just how unfair things are for taxpayers, local companies and workers,\u201d Renkema said in a statement. \u201cTaxpayers will be overcharged by at least $1 million on this project and many local companies and skilled workers will have no chance to work on that project. How fair is that?\u201d\n\n\nThe current rules\u00a0prevent many local companies and their workers from working on projects like the court house or improvements to the water treatment facilities, Sault Online has reported. PAC\u00a0and the Christian Labour Association of Canada (CLAC), which represents employees of companies through an interdisicplinary model, assert that, according to many studies, this also drives up the costs of these taxpayer-funded projects.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue of both cost and fairness,\u201d Sault Online quoted CLAC representative Ian DeWaard\u00a0as saying. \u201cThe current tendering restrictions are preventing local contractors from bidding on public projects and this is fundamentally wrong. All qualified union and non-union companies should have the right to bid on publicly funded projects. Fair and open tendering is the only way to give residents the right to work in their own community and to achieve maximum value for money on municipal projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cCLAC is calling on all councillors to support this resolution so they can get the facts they need to make an informed decision about next steps,\u201d says DeWaard. \u201cWe believe that the study will show that when particular unions are able to monopolize work that is paid for by municipal governments, costs go up and public dollars buy less of the needed additions, refurbishments, and infrastructure replacements.\u201d\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here",

        "text":"More burned San Bruno homes meet bulldozer fate\u00a0\n\nThree months after the San Bruno gas explosion, the disaster has officially claimed three more homes.\n\nA 30-inch transmission pipeline owned by PG&E exploded Sept. 9, and the initial blast and fire killed eight people and injured dozens more.\n\nIt took an hour and 46 minutes for PG&E to shut off fuel in the line, during which time first-responders tried to keep the fire from spreading. In the end, 35 homes were completely destroyed and were demolished this fall. Fifty-eight other homes were damaged.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the San Bruno City Council approved a plan to demolish three more homes that had been yellow-tagged, meaning they were too damaged to occupy but not so damaged that they required bulldozing.\n\nAdditional inspections by insurance companies determined that the homes were so damaged it would be more expensive to repair than replace them.\n\nThe city will receive $90,000 from PG&E to pay for the demolition by a private contractor.\n\nOne of the homes that will be demolished is owned by Arturo Vasquez, who was home the night of the fire but escaped unscathed. When he returned to his home, almost everything in it had been licked by flames.\n\nThe home was initially red-tagged, which meant no one could enter it. After a reassessment, it was downgraded to a yellow tag, so Vasquez and his wife could enter.\n\n\u201cIf you could name a piece of furniture in your home, from a chair to a lamp, it was destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there were nooks and crannies where there were little surprises, mementos that didn\u2019t burn.\u201d\n\nNow Vasquez is ready for the home to be demolished.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of an ongoing source of angst. There\u2019s so much mold in it now. We\u2019re ready to have it torn down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a relief to have that out of the way and feel like we\u2019re moving forward.\u201d\n\nAbout The Author\n\nKatie Worth\n\nPin It\n\nLatest in Peninsula\n\n\u00a9 2019 The San Francisco Examiner\n\nWebsite powered by Foundation",

But here they sit, in their low-slung office along Texas 60, talking water, or the lack of it.\n\nThe Savage family, like many rice farmers, are facing a third year in a row without irrigation water from the Colorado River. That\u2019s because Texas officials have cut off deliveries to maintain reservoirs near drought-stricken Austin, more than 100 miles away.\n\nThis would have seemed ludicrous not too long ago. For decades, farmers had all the water they could use from the Colorado. They now are idling land, laying off workers and wondering whether they have a future in cultivating rice.\n\nThe Savage family, for one, will try for the first time to grow corn, a less profitable crop but one that does not require the copious amounts of water that rice does.\n\n\u201cWe have to diversify if we still want to farm,\u201d said Stewart Savage, an affable 53-year-old who has worked at the farm nearly his entire life. \u201cBut we can\u2019t grow enough corn to sustain (the five-family operation). We are not swapping dollars\u201d by switching crops.\n\nIn a season of hard decisions in the Texas rice belt, growers and owners of related business say they are trying just to get to next year. Maybe it will rain by then. But it\u2019s clear farming\u2019s hold on the land is fragile.\n\n\u201cFarmers are seeing the nasty end of population growth,\u201d in Austin and other places upstream, Ronald Kaiser, a professor of water law and policy at Texas A&M; University, told the Houston Chronicle (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1fBPCau). \u201cWe are probably looking at a long-term transition\u201d for agriculture.\n\nThe Colorado rises in West Texas, winds through the Hill Country and bisects Matagorda County before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. Farmers on the coastal plains began drawing from the rain-fed river in the 1880s.\n\nA half-century later, the Lower Colorado River Authority built a chain of reservoirs in Central Texas to generate power, tame floods and provide a reliable supply of water for farmers and others. The state\u2019s population has surged since then, with more and more people moving into communities that barely existed, if at all, when the dams were constructed.\n\nTexas projects the population of the lower Colorado watershed to double to nearly 3 million people by 2060, and it\u2019s apparent that there is not enough water to meet everyone\u2019s needs. The persistent drought only has heightened tensions among those who rely on the river.\n\nHistorically, growers are the largest users of Colorado water. Rice is a water-intensive crop, grown in fields flooded at 3 to 4 inches deep. In Matagorda County alone, farmers have built about 400 miles of canals to carry the river water to the cropland.\n\nWith enough water, rice farmers can harvest twice, once in July and again in October. But their supply is interruptible during dry times - unlike shares for municipalities and industry, which pay a significantly higher rate than irrigators.\n\nIn 2012, with low water levels in the reservoirs, the river authority took the unprecedented step of withholding water from the farmers. It happened again last year. And again earlier this month, the start of the growing season.\n\nThe river authority said it could not deliver water to farmers because of record low flows into the reservoirs. The lakes are now 38 percent full, meaning any release would threaten the water supply for more than 1 million people living in and around Austin, state officials said.\n\nThe river authority plans to build at least one reservoir in rice country to store rainfall on the coastal plain and ease the burden on the Central Texas lakes, but the first one will not be completed until 2017.\n\nIts emergency orders, meanwhile, have sent a jolt through Colorado, Matagorda and Wharton counties, which usually produce 5 percent of the nation\u2019s rice crop. The three-county area lost more than 1,200 jobs in the first year without irrigation water from the river, according to a Texas A&M; analysis released this month.\n\nThe hardest hit was Matagorda County, where more than 90 percent of its rice acreage went unplanted in the first year without water from the Colorado. As a result, the direct value of its rice production plunged from $20.7 million to $2.4 million, the Texas A&M; study found.\n\n\u201cThe Colorado River is the economic lifeblood of Matagorda County,\u201d said Haskell Simon, a longtime rice farmer who has been unable to grow a crop since the restrictions began.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not only the farmers who are hurting. A crop-duster went out of business, and a fuel supplier stopped making bulk deliveries to farms in Matagorda County.\n\nBU Growers, for one, expects to see sales for seed rice and its drying and storage services drop 75 percent this year from levels three years ago. The company is looking more to Louisiana for rice to meet its brokerage contracts.\n\n\u201cI feel like I have one foot in the grave,\u201d said Joe Crane, BU Grower\u2019s managing partner.\n\nStill, the consensus seems to be that Bay City, Matagorda County\u2019s seat, won\u2019t die soon. But the 17,500-person town understands that its future remains intertwined with the farmers.\n\nThe businesses tied to agriculture \u201ccan come and go,\u201d Crane said. \u201cBut if the growers go, we won\u2019t be back.\u201d\n\nIn the Savage family\u2019s office hangs a framed poster-size photograph of three combine harvesters moving across fields full of nearly waist-high rice plants. The scene is from 2011, the last year the farm received irrigation water from the Colorado.\n\nSince then, the family has returned two of the leased machines to the dealership. There\u2019s no reason to keep all of them when there isn\u2019t as much rice to harvest, Stewart Savage said as he looked at the picture.\n\nThe family, like others, survived the last two years with the help of crop insurance, but that\u2019s going away. The payments for equipment and land and taxes are not.\n\nThis year, the Savage family will be able to pump groundwater for about 500 acres of rice, an organic variety of long-grain American basmati. But the new water supply won\u2019t be enough to cover all of the land planted in past years.\n\nThat\u2019s why the family is planting about 700 acres of corn, a crop that isn\u2019t as thirsty as rice. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this is a one-year deal because we want to go back to rice,\u201d Stewart Savage said. \u201cOur land is for rice.\u201d\n\nUpstream interests have criticized the rice farmers for growing crops that required too much water and for exporting their product - some of the grain is shipped to Mexico and South America, among other places.\n\nBut the Savage family and other farmers say Matagorda County is uniquely suited for rice because of the clay layer under the thin topsoil, as well as the climate. The price for rice is also better than other crops.\n\nRice generates about two times more revenue per acre than corn, said Brent Batchelor, a Bay City-based agent for the Texas A&M; AgriLife Extension Service, which assists farmers.\n\nIn all, Matagorda County farmers will grow about 25,000 acres of corn this year, up from about 15,000 acres before the restrictions on Colorado water, Batchelor said.\n\nMeanwhile, farmers will cultivate about 2,500 acres of rice, down from 25,000 acres three years ago.\n\nRather than switch crops and invest in new expensive equipment or a water well, Billy Mann will let cattle graze where he once grew rice. \u201cThe payout will take too long for me,\u201d said Mann, 73, whose two sons are not interested in following him into farming.\n\nThe grim situation keeps Harley Savage, the 83-year-old patriarch who followed his father and grandfather into rice farming, awake at night. He worries about the future for his sons, as well as his two grandsons, Scott and Stew, both in their 20s, who have joined the family business.\n\n\u201cYou never think this is going to happen, that someone is going to tell you that you can\u2019t farm,\u201d Harley Savage said. \u201cI think about how we can keep this all together. I just don\u2019t know if we can support five families on corn.\u201d\n\n\nInformation from: Houston Chronicle, http:\/\/www.houstonchronicle.com\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus\n\n\nClick to Read More\n\nClick to Hide",
