She's become a red carpet staple in recent months, and it's always a pleasure to see her, in part because of her great cut.Stroup went short earlier this year, and she's never looked better. Her naturally brown hair has been lightened and ever-so-softly highlighted for a slightly piece-y look, which was then cut into a choppy bob.

Deyn's been growing out her short crop of androgynous platinum hair, but she still maintains an edge that sets her apart. Deyn's stick-straight hair has been layered with longer side-swept bangs into a choppy bob, which suits her '80s Drama Queen look perfectly.More pictures of Agyness Deyn:Read\u00a0Full\u00a0Story\n\nChoppy Bob Haircuts: Lily Allen\n\nBy Alicia Diaz Dennis on\nGetty Images British songbird Lily Allen has a super-cute choppy bob.

And yes, part of that is because Nars and Guido buck the trends and go wild here and going into the hair and makeup room feels a little like going into a carnival funhouse, but it's also because Jacobs is one of the few designers who seems to really give the beauty just as much thought as the fashion. You see the look\u2014whether it's no makeup or a bun coming off the forehead or, in this case, greasy hair! clumpy lashes! blue shadow! red glitter!\u2014and your first thought is, \"What the\u2014?!\" But then you step back and listen and start to realize that every crazy, weird, amazing detail matters and together they all add up to tell this story about the Marc girl that's so much more personal than it is elsewhere. This go around, she's a girl who is too busy partying 'til the morning and sleeping 'til the next party to bother with shampoo or makeup remover, which is why her skin is greasy, her hair is wilted and thrown up haphazardly with vintage pins she stole or found at her favorite thrift store and her mascara is five days old and dried into thick spidery clumps. If you're looking for a how-to here, you're missing the whole point. Nars and Marc don't like pretty, and maybe we don't, either\u2014because after all, even when the girl looks like a hot mess or a teenage boy or an unsettling mannequin (and it's always something), you still want to be her every damn time.\n\nBackstage Essentials: Redken Guts 10, $18, ulta.com; NARS Eye Paint in Solomon Islands, $25, and Audacious Mascara, $26, narscosmetics.com.\n\n1 of 26\nProenza Schouler\n\nThe Look: Strength in Simplicity\n\nHow-To: Hairstylist Anthony Turner described the simple, single braid down the back at Proenza Schouler as \"Cuba meets New York,\" a nod to the confident, sexy women the designers met on a recent trip to the Caribbean country. He prepped damp hair with thickening spray and rough-dried it with his hands, then tied it off in a low ponytail before braiding for a clear line. It was the perfect complement to a collection that was both raw and feminine.\n\nBackstage Essentials: Bumble and Bumble Thickening Hairspray, $29, bumbleandbumble.com.\n\n2 of 26\n\nThe Look: Modern Femininity\n\nHow-To: Birds, and the architecture of ornate birdcages, inspired Marchesa's Spring collection, a mix of feathers, fluttery details, look-at-me tulle and dramatic corseting. Hairstylist Antonio Corral Calero wanted a whimsical style that nodded to the theme, but still felt fashion-forward. \"The girl here is really confident and quite romantic and I also wanted to do something that inspired the real woman to recreate it back home.\" Calero made a precise middle part, then brushed the flatironed hair back into an ultratight ponytail using hairspray and a shine treatment to keep it flyaway-free. Next, he tightly twisted the length of the ponytail around the base of the elastic, stopping one turn early, so that the ends peacock-ed out. For makeup, Gucci Westman delivered the girliest, brightest lips of the season\u2014shocking pink that felt sexier and more unexpected than red\u2014and if you think she just brushed on a lipstick, maybe a lip liner, and sent the models on their way, think again. No, this color was the result of layering five different products (\"I did six colors when I did the test, but then I was like, let me narrow this down,\" said Westman)\u2014a liner, two matte liquid lipsticks that dry instantly, \"so if you mess up, you have to quickly nip it or it'll be there til the girl goes to Italy,\" and two matte lipsticks. \"All together it creates this gorgeous orchid fuchsia pink that looks beautiful against tan skin,\" said Westman.\"\n\nBackstage Essentials: M.A.C. Pro Longwear Lip Pencil in More to Love, $20, Lipstick in Flat Out Fabulous and Girl About Town, $17, Matte Liquid Lipstick in To Matte with Love and Personal Statement, available Spring 2016; Moroccanoil Glimmer Shine, $28, moroccanoil.com; SK-II Facial Treatment Mask, $17, sephora.com.\n\n3 of 26\n\nThe Look: Working Girl Chic\n\nHow-To: Beauty and fashion editors alike approached the first DKNY show under Public School designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne with anticipation, eager to see which direction the brand would go in. Turns out, a very cool, and very wearable, one was the answer. After seasons of out-there hair and makeup (and that's putting it nicely), it was \"time for a palette cleanser,\" said hairstylist Eugene Souleiman. \"We needed to do something very different from what we've done before, so it's really clean, defined and almost masculine with the side part.\" He worked exclusively with hairspray, spraying it right at the roots for a wet, shiny finish and moving the can further away as he moved down the head for a smooth transition into hair that has \"a floating quality in the back.\" Makeup artist Yadim referenced a mood board that included photos of Christy Turlington and Linda Evangelista\u2014fresh and natural meets '90s power players. The majority of models wore hardly any makeup, but ten wore strong red lipstick. \"We didn't decide based on the clothes or the look, it was more intuitive; I would look at some of the girls and say, 'Oh my god, she's totally that woman,\" said Yadim. (To keep the color in place, he used the old Hollywood tissue trick: Press a 2-ply tissue on the lips, dab a powder puff on top, remove the tissue and reapply the lip color. Repeat two or three times.) \"I think any woman would want to wear this look. It's fresh and beautiful and if you're afraid of the red lip, don't do it\u2014you have options. No one has to do a trend.\"\n\nBackstage Essentials: Maybelline Vivid Matte Liquid Lipstick (out early 2015) and Lip Studio Color Blur in Orange Ya Glad, $8, drugstore.com; Wella EIMI Stay Firm Workable Finishing Hairspray, $17.50, ulta.com.\n\n4 of 26\nGetty Images\nOscar de la Renta\n\nThe Look: Evening Ease\n\nHow-To: Feminine, beautiful, rich\u2014these are the keywords that work every time at an Oscar show, both for the collection and the beauty. Last season, it was all about tight, slick French twists and graphic black liquid liner; this season, loose ponytails and bright red lips\u2014proof that there are so many ways to do girly glamour. Guido Palau's trick for ponytails that felt softer and more thoughtful was to center part only to the middle of the head and blowdry the hair at the crown back with a round brush. After making a low ponytail, he wrapped a grosgrain ribbon around the elastic and tied a half bow. \"You want it to just fall; that's the key to a softened, very simple style. You just feel like she's effortlessly beautiful.\"\n\nBackstage Essentials: M.A.C. Lip Pencil in Follow Your Heart, $16.50, maccosmetics.com; Redken Satinwear 02, $19, ulta.com.\n\n5 of 26\nMichael Kors\n\nThe Look: Desert Beauty\n\nHow-To: The designer's earthy, deconstructed Spring collection felt like somewhat of a departure from the norm, but the windblown hair and what Dick Page called \"a dusty, desert tan\" was classic Kors. Page skipped blush and instead layered bronzers together, brushing gold ones (\"gold is great for warming up fairer girls\") across all the high points of the face and then going over with matte ones for more depth. Vaseline was swiped across the lids and lips as a finishing touch.\n\nBackstage Essentials: Michael Kors Bronze Powder, $50, macys.com.\n\n6 of 26\n\nThe Look: Fairy Princess\n\nHow-To: Combine couture training with an artist's bohemian aesthetic and lots of color and sequins and you get Delpozo; thankfully, Joseph Font knows exactly where to draw the line and practice restraint. Others might coat the entire lid in sparkles, he chooses to scatter them in the center; in favor of pink blush or peach lips, he goes bare. It's whimsical and offbeat and yet it makes total sense.\n\nBackstage Essentials: M.A.C. Glitter in Silver, $22, maccosmetics.com.\n\n7 of 26\n\nThe Look: Gilded Goddess\n\nHow-To: It's always fun to walk into Rodarte knowing there's going to be a look\u2014whether that's a row of eyebrow piercings, a dotting of crystals underneath the eyes or butterfly clips in the hair. This season, accessories came out again in the form of vintage-inspired gold and silver barrettes created by the designers. As is shaping up to be the trend, not all the models wore them; for the ones who did, Odile Gilbert fastened them in unexpected places\u2014across the bangs or behind the ears. Makeup artist James Kaliardos took his inspiration from poetry, Nathaniel Hawthorne specifically. \"He was a wild renegade, a young and incredible talent who didn't know how popular he would be,\" said Kaliardos, who compared the poet to the independent spirit of the Mulleavy sisters. \"This is the linchpin of the look,\" he said, holding up a contour and highlight palette. He ran a brush through both the bronze shade and the illuminator so the two swirled together, then ran it from the halfway point of the cheekbone up to the temple in a swift, slicing motion for the prettiest blend of glow and shade.\n\nBackstage Essentials: NARS Dual-Intensity Blush in Craving, $45, sephora.com; K\u00e9rastase Cr\u00e8me de la Cr\u00e8me, $37, kerastase-usa.com.\n\n8 of 26\nVera Wang\n\nThe Look: French Editrix\n\nHow-To: Backstage, hairstylist Eugene Souleiman described this season's Vera girl as \"the kind who is maybe interning for French Vogue, from a nice family, but a little bit edgy and naughty. She doesn't have a boyfriend\u2014and she doesn't want one.\" While we respectfully disagree on the job title (this girl is at least an assistant editor), Soulei... (truncated)",

Cardi B rolled up to Paris for Fashion Week. And since she touched down in the \u2018City of Love\u2019, the 28-year-old rapper has served up some seriously amazing looks.\u00a0\n\nAnd boy did the Bacardi rapper turn heads.\u00a0\n\nCardi B\n\nFrom golden nipple embellishments to coats that could quite literally kill, it\u2019s easy to understand why.\u00a0\n\nBelcalis Almanzar, known professionally as Cardi B, is an American rapper whose hometown is New York City. Born and raised in The Bronx, she first attracted attention for discussing her career as a stripper on social media; coupled with her \u201cno filter attitude\u201d, she became an internet celebrity through Instagram.\n\nNot only is the millionaire popular for her singing, but the \u201cWAP\u201d performer also has a style that is truly unmatched.\n\nCardi B knows how to slay the fashion game! The Grammy winner stepped out recently at Paris Fashion Week at the Thierry Mugler show. Making a return after giving birth to her son \u2013 with his name yet to be released.\n\nFrom New York to London, Milan and now Paris, fashion lovers, models and designers are already enjoying a taste of luxury in France for Paris Fashion Week 2021.\n\nThe official schedule for the spring\/summer 2022 collections started on September 28\u00a0 and will end on October 5 2021.\n\nParis Fashion Week has one of the most important Fashion Week schedules since it\u2019s home to many great designers and shows you don\u2019t want to miss. Think of Louis Vuitton, Off-White, Herm\u00e8s, Chanel, Givenchy and many more.\n\nThis year, the couple were exclusively invited to attend Tuesday\u2019s opening party for the exhibition Couturissime at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs (MAD) in Paris, hosted by L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\n\nThis event was held by director and fashion demi-god, Thierry Mugler, who owns the luxury fashion brand \u2013 Mugler.\n\nScroll through Mugler\u2019s Instagram to see all the stars who joined his opening exhibition for Paris Fashion Week 2021:\n\nMore than 150 pieces, designed by Mugler from 1973 to 2014, are included in the exhibition. This went along with photography, perfumes, music videos, fembots and more.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t just Cardi B who made an appearance. Former models and muses like Farida Khelfa and Carla Bruni; designers like Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren, Riccardo Tisci, Haider Ackermann, Jean Charles de Castelbajac, Christian Louboutin and many more stars were spotted inside.\n\n\u201cMugler, you are truly one of my favourite creative minds in the WORLD! I\u2019m mind blown looking at your collections from over the years. A true Genius!\u201d\n\nCardi B\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time that Cardi B has gone all out for the Paris Fashion Week. In the past, she has been spotted wearing a slew of outrageous outfits.\u00a0\n\nAccording to Hollywood Life, in 2019 Cardi was literally covered up in green flowers as she rocked a Richard Quinn AW19 ensemble featuring an oversized jacket with a cinched-in belt, matching pointed high boots, and a floral face mask that covered her head, making her completely unrecognizable.\n\nIt seems that Cardi B simply just creates her very own runway and why not? She has been killing the style game ever since.\n\nNylon stated that Cardi B has yet to make an official runway show appearance, but she\u2019ll likely sit front row for Balenciaga and Chanel. In the meantime, she\u2019s been living her best \u201cCardi in Paris\u201d life and dressed to the nines, thanks to her long time friend and stylist Kollin Carter.\n\nAt the Paris Fashion Week, Cardi B has been spotted shopping, partying, and at dinner, touring around with her husband Offset. Every night so far the star has given us a different look for every occasion.\n\nHere are the star\u2019s wildest looks that are turning heads at the yearly event:\n\n1. The Ravishing Ruby Red Tribute\n\nThe rapper stunned on the red carpet in an elaborate Fall 1994 look from the Mugler archives. On 28 September 2021, she went for an over-the-top red Mugler creation with a glittering gown that featured a dramatic cape and large feathers surrounding her head. She was dripping in red ruby jewels and even had them dotted along her eyebrows.\n\n2. The Squeeze Me Please Black Bodysuit\n\nLater that night Cardi B changed into a second all-black Mugler look. She wore a leather bodysuit that looked like a sheer black dress, which was layered under a black bustier. This was connected to a mesh skirt.\n\n3. The Tweed Golden Crown Moment\n\nThe couple were both outfitted in Schiaparelli ensembles before heading to a party in Paris on Wednesday, September 29. Cardi B wore a futuristic look that features gold chest pieces and a golden eye-piece that covers most of her head.\n\n4. A Classy French Oh La La!\n\nLater that night she then changed into an all-black Schiaparelli look that had a plunging neckline and French beret.\n\n5. A Punk-Rock Inspired Spike Edition\n\nOn Thursday, Sept. 30, Cardi B made a stop at the Balenciaga office ahead of its runway show on Sunday. She wore a Richard Quinn spiky, studded coat, along with the platform, goth core-learning boots from Rick Owens, Jaupin bespoke sunglasses, and jewellery from Chrome Hearts and By Lolita.\n\n6. The Sparkling Golden Jumpsuit\n\nDate night! On Thursday, September 30, the \u2018Love & Hip Hop\u2019 star slipped into a chic Chanel jumpsuit before heading to the launch of Parade Issue, a new magazine, with Offset. Cardi switched looks for dinner at Giraffe restaurant with Offset that same night. She wore a diamond-printed and sparkling gold jumpsuit with black pumps and a Ruslan Baginskiy cotton beret.\n\nWith multiple shows still on the go, it is safe to say that Paris Fashion Week 2021 is more about what designers, models and celebrities bring to the runway.\u00a0\n\nCardi B may be extraordinarily edgy this year, but she is simply enjoying the unique combination of beautiful architecture, unspoiled history, fine cuisine and fine wine in Paris with her husband.\n\nFor a full schedule of the Paris Fashion Week 2021 click here.\n\nSEE MORE: Milan Fashion Week 2021 | Versace\u2019s Star-Studded Runway Goes Viral\n\nAuthor: Michelle Laver",

That is, underwear that both feels and looks better than just \u201cgood, I guess\u201d.\n\n      That means underwear that 1) fits, 2) doesn't have holes in it, 3) is less than five years old, and 4) doesn't induce cringing when your pants come off.\n\n      Beyond being a practical necessity, slipping on a decent pair of underpants in the morning is one of the most important parts of starting a new day. Think of a good, clean, well-fitting, sexy (yes, sexy) pair of underwear as a psychological advantage.\n\n      Sure, some guys will argue that the state of your underwear doesn't really matter. Nobody's going to see it, they'll tell you. Well, don't listen to them \u2014 bet on yourself. Just remember that if you ever take off a fine Italian combed cotton suit to reveal ratty, dingy, sweaty tighty-whities underneath, your junk's first impression is ruined, forever.\n\n      So now that we all agree, the challenge is to find you just the right pair. There are a lot of different styles, looks, and degrees of premium-ness \u2014 and each has its own place in a man's wardrobe. Here are some of the best models available that offer A-grade value without threatening your riches. All items are classified by cut and arranged by price (from lowest to highest).\n\n      Note: All items come in various colorways \u2014 just click through to see the options.\n\n      Boxer Briefs\n\n      Best for: Medium-intensity sports, everyday wear, dressing up\n\n      These guys cover up to half the thigh, which helps protect from chafing against coarse materials (like raw denim) or during workouts. Often, boxer-briefs come in a mid-rise fit, which means they arrive at just above the hip bones. They provide the same support as a brief, and also offer complete coverage in the front and back.\n\n      MeUndies Boxer Briefs\n\n      As an online-only company, Californian brand MeUndies manages to keep your costs low while still offering top-quality goods. The boxer briefs are perhaps their most popular model of underwear and, after getting some of our own, we know why \u2014 not only are they more comfortable than other, more expensive underwear we've tried, but they also come packing a surprisingly fun attitude.\u00a0\n      $20.00 at\n\n      Emporio Armani Boxer Brief\n\n      Simple, soft and virtually seameless. These cotton boxer briefs from fashion house Emporio Armani are slim enough to fit under pretty much any pants \u2014 let alone look good when the pants come off.\n      $33.88 at\n\n      Frigo Boxer Briefs\n\n      For the entrepreneur, these boxer briefs mean business. Equipped with a breathable mesh interior pocket to keep things feeling fresh and in place (no more awkward \"repositioning\"), and adjustment straps for the ultimate personalized fit.\n      Starting at $36.00 at\n\n      Tommy John 'Second Skin' Boxer Brief\n\n      The Second Skin boxer briefs from Tommy John are made from 90%\u00a0non-piling modal and 10% spandex, and are cut longer than most to provide total coverage and to minimize chaffing.\u00a0\n      $38.91 at\n\n      Calvin Klein Bold Micro Boxer Brief (2-pack)\n\n      Calvin Klein is perhaps one of the first names that comes to mind when we think of classic American underwear. Made from 100% cotton, these are a great everyday style that won't ever feel out of date.\n      $44.95 at\n\n      AskMen may receive a portion of revenue if you click a link in this article and buy a product or service.

Hotly debated by fashionistas on its design merits (see The Cut) but adored by tech geeks the world over. This personal piece of technology combines a watch, fitness tracker, app and notifications panel \u2013 with the added novelty of designer-made bands to reflect your individual style.\n\nHave you ever zipped from work to a ticketed event only to have to fumble through your bag to find the print-out of your tickets? I\u2019ve seen first-hand the convenience of say rocking up and having an EventBrite QR-code pop up on the iWatch screen, allowing simple scanning and entrance. It\u2019s so schmick, I was envious!\n\nIn the months since the launch of the iWatch I have seen varying levels of uptake:\u00a0my FitBit-loving friends have generally\u00a0replaced that tech with an\u00a0iWatch but others alternate between the iWatch and an analog time piece depending on their mood.\u00a0See more of the Apple iWatch here.\n\nThe World\u2019s Best TRAVEL JACKET with 15 Features || BAUBAX\n\nbaubax travel jacket 15 features\n\nBAUBAX Jackets \u2013 \u201cThe Swiss army knife of travel wear\u201d- CNN Image: Kickstarter\n\nThis already-funded Kickstarter project has less than 48-hours to go,\u00a0BAUBAX has prototyped the \u201cbest travel jacket\u201d in four different styles, that at the time of writing, over 38,000 people had pledged to support.\n\nAvailable for both men and women in sweatshirt, windbreaker, bomber jacket and blazer styles, the jackets boast 15 features compelling CNN to call it \u201cthe Swiss army knife of travel wear.\u201d\n\nThe wrinkle-free blazer is one of the styles that features a \u2013 get this \u2013 removable inflatable pillow. This travel pillow boasts 2-second inflation\/one-press-deflation, making it perfect for business travellers who catch the red-eye flight to start the work day. The sizing for men\u2019s blazers are based on Calvin Klein while Banana Republic is the model for women\u2019s.\n\nSee the image-by-image break down of the features over on Kickstarter\u00a0\u2013 which also includes genius video if you can work out how to play it subtly at work \ud83d\ude09\n\nQuiksilver wet suits that look like the business\n\n\nTBWA\\Hakuhodo and Quiksilver present True Wetsuits to save the busy professional the time and hassle of having to change between the boardroom and beach.\n\n\nThe water-repellant shirt features \u2018dry flight\u2019 technology.\n\nBack in April of this year, we were agog when we saw that genius had happened\u00a0over at Quiksilver via a collaboration with TBWA\\Hakuhodo. The result? The business suit that will take you from work-to-surf; shirt and all.\n\nMade of 2mm neoprene, a technical fabric that is au-courrant in the fashion world, the suits are sharply cut and come in \u201coffice smart\u201d and \u201cparty tuxedo\u201d styles to ensure that your wet suit befits your workplace.\n\nAt the time, AdWeek reported that these suits were available only in Japan and only in men\u2019s cuts; custom-made that will set you back $2,500; which is not too bad considering that what they\u2019d save you on dry cleaning!\n\nSee more on DesignBoom\u2013 which yes, includes genius video also.\n\nWho is the smartest and prettiest of all the reusable coffee cups?\n\nfrank green coffee cups\n\nFrank Green SmartCup\u2122 has been awarded for its design by Good Design.\n\nfrank green smart coffee cup in situ\n\n\nFinally \u00a0a reusable coffee cup that doesn\u2019t interfere with the taste of your coffee!

Instead of just tailoring his menswear for women, as was expected, he showed a feminine assortment of chiffon dresses and silk jackets\u2014the result was fantastic.\n\nMost Popular\n\nToms + The Row: The Row had many great new things to offer this season, including menswear, lots of fur, and handbags. But, we're most excited about their collaboration on chic plaid, wool-cashmere and herringbone slip-ons with Toms shoes, especially because, unlike most pieces in The Row, they'll actually be affordable.\n\nDax Gabler: Devi Kroell, who left her namesake line less than a year ago, has successfully reemerged this season with Dax Gabler, a line of handbags, shoes and jackets. The metallic exotic skins were gone, but the pieces were still bold and full of texture.\n\nNahm: As difficult as it may be for some to take Ally Hilfiger seriously, her latest design attempt, with Nary Manivong, was impressive. The line of deconstructed shirt dresses was cool and wearable definitely shows promise.\n\nMore from ELLE:",

But, \u00a0As exciting as it is, it can also be extremely overwhelming .\u00a0To help save you some trouble I created a list of five tips to help you thrift successfully!\n\nCheck out my tips below\u00a0\n\n1-go alone\nWhen thrifting you must be extremely attentive, so going with a buddy might be a distraction\nThrift shops are usually very organized, but its impossible for employees to keep everything in order. So go ahead and look through the racks of ugly dresses and abandoned\u00a0Christmas\u00a0sweaters.\n3-Try everything on\nUnlike department stores there is only one of each so, if something doesn't fit you can't ask for a different size\nThrift stores are extremely cheap so don't hesitate to tore apart your finds to create something new\n5-Keep an open mind\nThrifting is suppose to be fun, you might not find everything you are looking for, but enjoy the experience!\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"7 Verishop Finds We're Obsessed With This Week\n\nFrom flowy skirts to silky dresses to swimsuits we never knew we needed, these are the pieces that piqued our interest.\n\nBy Carly Milne 15 Jul, 2020 10:07 PMTags\nE-comm: 7 Verishop Finds We're Obsessed With This Week\n\nWe love these products, and we hope you do too. E! has affiliate relationships, so we may get a small share of the revenue from your purchases. Items are sold by the retailer, not E!\n\nWe admit it: we adore shopping. And\u00a0we adore it even more when we visit Verishop, 'cause they have so many things to fall in love with!\n\nFor example? There's super stylish swimsuits we just can't resist, romantic skirts that beg for a rom com meet cute, and even totally fantastic denim that shapes our curves just right. There's even accessories, like artisan-made earrings with impeccable style.\n\nJoin us in our obsession, won't you? Shop more of our current fave Verishop finds below!\u00a0\n\nScore Up to 70% Off at Nordstrom's Extra 25% Off Sale\n\nRevel Rey Gene One-Piece Swimsuit\n\nWe're not usually fans of one-piece swimsuits, but this one is making us a believer. With lapels (!!) that frame the deep V cut in the front, and an open curved back, we're pretty sure this is meant more for lounging than swimming... but we're okay with that. No wonder it's become one of Verishop's best sellers.\n\nAuguste The Label Sadie Violet Maxi Skirt\n\nThis skirt was made for picnics. Or beach walks. Or pretty much anything where some kind of rom com-esque date is concerned. Maybe it's because of the floral print, or maybe it's because a classic, flowy, tiered maxi skirt makes us think of romantic things... whatever the reason, it's pretty and we love it. Just make sure you hand wash it in cold water so it'll last.\n\nAuguste The Label Keepsake Midi Dress\n\nThis midi dress also falls into the \"romantic fashion\" category, but it could also be part of the \"luxe loungewear\" category, if you're feeling overly decadent. All this to say that it's versatile, allowing you to dress it up or down, and it's made of cupro, commonly referred to as \"vegan silk.\" Don't worry if pink isn't your color, as it also comes in rust.\n\nSoko Karamu Horn Hoop Earrings\n\nGo for gold in these striking hoops, accented with ethically-sourced horn discs that give each pair a one-of-a-kind touch, thanks to variations in the natural material. They're made of recycled brass and ethically handcrafted by Kenyan artisans. Pair 'em with a plain white tee or tank to give them the spotlight they deserve.\n\nBene Bud Bucket Bag\n\nSo this one's a bit of a splurge, but we couldn't help ourselves. Isn't this bucket bag stunning? With a square shape and removable pouch, it holds more than your average bag, and even features a double side zipper that offers a pocket with more storage. Plus, it also has little feet so it has something to stand on when you put it on the floor. If this deep wine color isn't the shade for you, it also comes in blue, black, grey and red.\n\nAllsaints Rafaella High Rise Pleated Short\n\nJust like that one-piece bathing suit up above, we also never pictured ourselves as dress shorts people... but 2020 is full of surprises. So here we are, totally loving these pleated slate blue shorts and wondering what we were doing with our lives before we met them. They're made of viscose, so you have to dry clean them, but the high-rise relaxed fit makes up for that.\n\nDL1961 Farrow Ankle High Rise Skinny Inclusive\n\nAvailable in light-wash blue and black denim, these stretch skinny jeans are a dream come true. With a high-rise and ankle-length, they rely on DL1961's\u00a0Instasculpt technology to smooth, sculpt, and conform to give your body a perfect fit, every time. Grab them in sizes ranging from 14W to 26W.\n\nNeed some shoes to go with these new clothes?\u00a0Lucky for you, Nordstrom Rack is having a Steve Madden flash sale with prices up to 60% off, but only for three days!\u00a0And if you'd like deals delivered directly to your in-box,\u00a0sign up for the Shop With E!

        "text":"7 Style Tips That Will Make All Men Look Taller\n\nIt's not all vertical stripes and platform shoes.\n\n\nWinston Churchill, Jon Stewart, James McAvoy, Daniel Radcliffe, Pablo Picasso. Fairly successful lot, wouldn't you agree? Between them they've saved the free world, both in movies and in real life, and defined modern art. If there were a Mount Rushmore of iconic 20th century figures, it's safe to say these guys would be on the short list. Short being the operative word here, because not one of them stands above 5'7\". But clearly their small-ish stature didn't hinder them from achieving great things, and, if you're a bit on the shorter side, it shouldn't hinder you either, at least when it comes to style.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nIt's important to remember that just because you are short, that doesn't mean you have to look short. A lot about height has to do with perception, and your clothes are on the front lines as far as changing that perception. Sure, you could rock Cuban heels like 5' 6\" Bono, but that look doesn't necessarily work for everybody. Or, you know, for anybody who isn't a famous rock star. But there are plenty of other tricks you can use, tricks that don't involve vertical stripes, or platform shoes. In the interest of maximizing your height, here are seven style tips that will help you look taller than your DNA intended:\n\n1. Stick to a Monochrome Palette\n\nWearing a monochrome color scheme, where you contrast shades rather than colors, will streamline your look and help create an illusion of height. And the darker the better, although steer clear of all black, as it will actually make you look shorter. If you do mix colors, or even shades, keep the darker ones on the lower half of your body and the lighter ones up top. It will create a lengthening effect by drawing the eye upward.\u00a0\n\n2. Avoid Baggy, Low-Waisted Trousers\n\nSagging your pants may be in for the under-20 set, but that doesn't make it right. And that goes doubly so if you're short. You'll want to wear your trousers at your natural waistline in order to maximize your leg line. The appearance of longer legs is a major factor in looking taller. Also, make sure you go for a slimmer cut trouser with a smaller trouser rise (the distance from the middle of the crotch seam to the top of the waistband), as that will help make your legs look longer too.\u00a0\n\n3. A Blazer Is Your Best Friend\n\nA fitted blazer or suit jacket will do a couple of things for you. First, it will help build up your shoulders, which adds height. Also, by keeping it buttoned, (listen to Tom Ford and always keep your jacket buttoned) it will create a slim silhouette that will make your chest look bigger and your waist look smaller, which will create both a slimming and heightening effect. Make sure your top button (on a two-button jacket) is above your navel to make your torso and legs look longer, and go with a shorter cut on the jacket.\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n4. Find a Good Tailor\n\nA good tailor is a necessity no matter your height, but it's especially essential if you're short. Fit is everything when it comes to looking taller, and you'll need an expert to help you accentuate the right lines and hide the bad ones. Most off-the-rack men's clothing (at least with American brands) is designed a little boxier in order to fit as many body types as possible. So, if you don't have a good tailor, your clothes will likely be loose and loose clothes make you look shorter. Even worse, subconsciously people will think you're too small to buy clothes that fit. So get a good tailor and tell him you want to look slim and tall.\u00a0\n\n5. Make Sure Your Shirt Doesn't Pass Your Hipbone\n\nIf you're short and wearing a button down shirt, you should be tucking it in 90 percent of the time. It will give you a slimmer line and make your legs look longer. But, if you absolutely have to un-tuck, or are wearing a shirt designed to be un-tucked (like a T-shirt), make sure that the hem doesn't go past your hipbone. Anything longer and it will swallow you up and make your legs look stubby.\u00a0\n\n6. Don't Wear Short Sleeves\n\nSo much of what you wear creates an optical illusion, and one of the weirder ones is that short sleeves will shorten your arms. If your arms look short, so will the rest of you. Instead of a short-sleeved button down then, wear a long sleeved shirt and then cuff the sleeves. This will create an unimpeded line that will make your arms, and as a result your body, look longer.\u00a0\n\n7. Keep Accessories Simple\n\nIn order to appear taller you want the eyes of whoever's looking at you to sweep upward. The more someone's eyes sweep upward, the taller they'll register whatever it is they're looking at. And to maintain that upward sweep, avoid anything that will draw their attention below your chest. Steer clear of flashy shoes, flashy watches, and big belt buckles (actually, you should try to avoid belts altogether). And if you absolutely have to have some flair, maybe go with a hat or a bright pocket square. But just remember this mantra: The lower you go, the simpler, and darker, you should go, too.\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nMore From MENtality",

        "text":"Why Does Hair Go Frizzy?\n\nIn humid summers or rainy autumns, the hair tends to go frizzy and fluffy, hard to handle. But there are several reasons that can affect your precious locks. Here are the most common reasons why the hair goes frizzy.\n\n1. Humidity\n\nThis is the most obvious and number one reason of all, and I\u2019m sure we all know how a humid summer day or rainy autumn can change the look of our hair in no time. But what exactly happens with the hair that changes it so radically? Simple: as we all now, the water (humidity in the air) is two parts Hydrogen and one part Oxygen. The high level of Hydrogen creates new bonds in the hair, which means your hair absorbs water at a molecular level, swelling until it changes the outermost layer of your hair. And if this happens with each hair piece, we already know what it looks like as an overall look.\n\nQuick tips: If this is the main reason why your hair becomes frizzy, try a Keratin treatment. There are many different ones to chose from, depending on your hair type and the desired results. Also, it would help a lot to use anti humidity hair care products.\n\n2. Dry or damaged hair\n\nBased on the description above, it is quite obvious that dry hair will absorb even more water and therefore cause a more severe frizziness. Same with damaged hair, as the structure of your hair, is compromised and it would be more prone to become the fluffy.\n\nQuick tips:\n\nDo your best to keep your hair hydrated. Keep it away from the sun, chlorine and salt water as much as possible and maintain your hair healthy at all times. When swimming a lot or going to the beach, rinse your hair thoroughly and put conditioner on before you enter the water and use a hat when staying in the sun for a longer time.\n\n3. Having the wrong haircut for your hair type\n\nEvery hair is different in its way: texture, density, colour treated an,d we all have different hair care routines. When getting a haircut done, it is essential to take in consideration all these factors, so that the final result will be the same even with your daily routine. Make sure the shape of the haircut helps you manage your hair instead of making your life harder.\n\nQuick tips:\n\nTell your hairdresser your concerns before having a haircut. In general, if you want to avoid frizziness, avoid getting your hair layered and choose the right hair care products.\n\n4. Using the wrong hair care products\n\nSome lucky ones out there don\u2019t need special care with their hair, and some just need a bit of an extra push to get a neater look. When choosing hair care products, seek professional advice. Because there are endless hair types and various lifestyles, there is now a wide variety of products that fit each and one of us. Find out from your hairdresser with one is best for you!\n\nQuick tips:\n\nSometimes an anti-frizz shampoo and conditioner are enough, but in some cases, you might need a smoothing range or a styling product that will manage your curls. Also, if the hair is dry, you might need a moisturising or nourishing product instead.\n\n5. Your daily routine\n\nWant it or not, every hairstyle needs to be looked after. This means, the way you treat it (products you use), the way you dry it and style it, everything will contribute to the final result which you will wear for a couple of days between your hair washes. If you\u2019re unsure what\u2019s the right way to manage your hair, or when getting a new look, ask your hairdresser how to deal with it at home.\n\nQuick tips:\n\nAvoid drying your hair upside-down. If you want it to dry naturally, use a diffuser and a product that will help tame the frizz and separate the curls.",

Stila is widely known as an amazing option for liquid eyeliner. it is a good formula that doesn't run, smear, crease or fade and the applicator is a dream. i consider myself an applicator connoisseur and this is one area where size really matters.\n\nthe Almay liquid liner is my saving grace. introduced to me by my best friend in 9th grade, this eyeliner is inexpensive, easy to apply and has one of my favorite applicator tips. when you go through it as often as i do, $20 on a department store brand gets a bit steep, however $7.99* is fits just right.\n\nYSL Lip Stain vs. L'Oreal Lip Stain\n\nYSL Lip Stains hit the market with a vengeance and became an immediate cult fave. these products were flying off the shelves with everyone clamoring for their favorite shade. why? it has the texture of a gloss but the longwear of a stain. basically the dream lip gloss\/stain. the downside of this dream product is its price. $34 for a lip stain isn't exactly in the budge.\n\nthankfully L'Oreal saw that the demand for this product was high and decided to make a more affordable version for the masses. while not quite as dreamy as the original, the L'Oreal stain works well and is offered at a more manageable price point of \u00a0$9.99*.\n\nLancome Mascara vs. L'Oreal Mascara\n\nLancome's Mascara is one of the best selling mascaras on the market. its formula boasts that it can sculpt, curl and load every lash. exactly what every woman is looking for.\u00a0\n\nL'Oreal Voluminous has been and always will be my favorite mascara. not only does it sculpt, curl and load every lash, it does it for less than half the price. honestly, i do not buy department store mascara because i have yet to find one that i love as much as i love the Voluminous. how about the price? $7.79* and it is worth every penny.\n\nBenefit Individual Lashes vs. Ardell Individual Lashes\n\nto put it plainly, there is no real difference. go for the less expensive option - Ardell Lashes $4.99*.",

But with the busy schedule of taking care of \u2014 and paying for\u2013 the kids, a Fancy mom might not always get a chance to splurge on herself. With Mother\u2019s Day approaching, treat your glam mom to something you know she would love, and would probably show off in her next #ootd or #momstyle Instagram photo. Don\u2019t get me wrong, homemade gifts from the kids are always, always cherished and appreciated. It\u2019s still nice to feel glamorous and chic\u00a0now and then. Below are 5 things under $50 to get you started or add to your list:\n\n\n1. \u201cGail\u201d Double Tie Necklace, Arthur & Livingston, $48\n\nI really love long, layering necklaces, especially with some visual interest. Arthur & Livingston takes its inspiration from\u00a0the Caribbean and are handcrafted in the USA. Each piece is unique, with a vibrant gemstone and metalwork.\n\nFriday Fresh Picks: Mother's Day Gifts for Fancy Moms |\n\n2. \u201cSheebani\u201d Flash Tattoos, $25\n\nBefore you tell yourself that your mom is\u00a0too old for temporary\u00a0tattoos, I\u2019m here to tell you she\u2019s not. If mom is\u00a0someone who likes to accessorize with a\u00a0conversation piece (ear cuff, midi rings, etc), then flash tattoos are the\u00a0next step. Try on the\u00a0hand, under the\u00a0wrist, or maybe the back of your neck .\u00a0She probably secretly\u00a0always wanted a real tattoo there. Sheebani is a henna-inspired collection that goes to a good cause.\u00a0Flash Tattoos donates\u00a05%\u00a0of the proceeds from each Sheebani collection purchase to The Miracle Foundation,\u00a0a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering orphans to reach their full potential by revolutionizing the way orphanages are run, funded, and managed in India.

If that\u2019s your mom (or wife) too, then get her a one-off box from Glossybox (meaning, you don\u2019t get automatically enrolled in their service with the purchase). She will get $430 worth of full-size skin care and color products.

        "text":"The Ideal Guide to Cruelty-free Makeup\n\nPeople have started becoming conscious about the cruelty-free cosmetics that are currently present in the market. They are more inclined towards spending money on those products, which have not been tested on animals. According to a research that has been conducted, almost hundred and fifteen million animals are used every year for various experiments, and this is one of the most important reasons as to why customers are moving towards cruelty-free makeup products.\n\nCruelty-free: what does it actually mean\n\nIts indicated on the carton of the makeup products, that the particular product you have picked has not been responsible for performing any experiments on animals, during the manufacturing process. Animal testing has already been banned in the European Union since the year 2013. Therefore, if you are in Britain and you are purchasing any beauty product, you can be assured that it is going to be cruelty-free.\n\nHowever, a significant problem that is still there is that animal testing is still legal in places like Australia and America. However, because of consumer awareness and the reluctance of using products that are tested on animals, brands are shifting to cruelty-free products. Opting for cruelty-free makeup products is definitely ethical for numerous reasons, but there are still many people who do not have a clear idea about cruelty-free beauty products and why they should be used.\n\nGiven below is a list of reasons as to why you should be making a room for animal-friendly alternatives.\n\nCruelty-free makeup products are not toxic\n\nThis is something that is absolutely true because all the ingredients that are used in cruelty-free products have a safety record. Therefore, you can be assured that you are using products that do not have any negative effects and are not going to harm you in any manner. There is a high probability that the ingredients you are putting all over your body are natural and do not contain any harsh chemicals.\n\nCruelty-free brushes are cleaner\n\nMost of us use makeup brushes, made up of animal hair. However, the fact is, that these brushes are actually harboring bacteria because of their hair structure. Animal hair is capable of trapping dead skin as well as oil, which is going to breed bacteria. It is also not possible to clean them thoroughly. They remain dirty despite of cleaning them.\n\nThis is why you should choose makeup brushes that are made up of synthetic hair. And when you are using synthetic-hair brushes, you will know that no animal has been harmed during the process.\n\nHow can you check if the makeup products you have selected are cruelty-free\n\nThere is a lot more that is associated with being cruelty-free than only one line that indicates that the product has not been tested on animals. Even if you see the picture of a mouse or a rabbit on your product, it obviously does not mean that it has not been tested on animals anywhere in the world. However, there is a single internationally recognized symbol for the cruelty-free products, which is the Leaping Bunny.\n\nAny company that is displaying this particular symbol tends to guarantee that no animal testing was involved in the development of that particular product. And these are the products that you should be selecting.\n\n\nChoosing cruelty-free products is going to provide you contentment because you will be assured that not a single animal was harmed during the manufacturing procedure.\u00a0\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

If highlighting is not part of your daily makeup routine, then right now is a good time to start. While powder highlighters have always been around, liquid highlighters are often less talked about. Whether you're looking for a subtle glow, or aiming for a glitter-heavy shine, here is a quick round up of liquid highlighters that you should consider picking up on your next shopping haul:\n\n\nOil-free and dermatologically tested, the hybrid formula of Tarteist\u2122 PRO glow liquid highlighter can mixed easily with your tinted moisturizer, or foundation, to get a naturally illuminating coverage. Use a blending sponge or your fingertips to highlight the high-points on your face like the cheekbones, brow bones, inner corner of the eye and cupid\u2019s bow. The Tarteist\u2122 PRO glow liquid highlighter contains: a) Mineral pigments that soften and soothe the skin. b) Rosa damascena flower water that is distilled from fresh rose blossoms, and calms the skin. c) Squalane, a naturally occurring skin emollient that retains and delivers skin moisture.\u00a0\n\nFor a more intense strobing glow, you can also pair this liquid highlighter, with the Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour powder highlighter. Available in a convenient squeezable tube packaging, the Tarteist\u2122 PRO glow is very creamy, and is super buildable (goes from sheer to opaque). With ultra-concentrated pearls and pigments, prepare to get a healthy, dewy glow, no matter what your skin-tone is!\n\n\nWith high-performance crystals, and 100 percent pure Argan oil, the Argan Enlightenment Illuminizer by Josie Maran promises skin nourishment and a radiant glow. Infused with Ancient daffodil, Madonna lily, and Poet\u2019s narcissus, the highlighter evens and brightens your skin tone to bring out the lit-from-within face glow. Mix it with your oil, moisturizer or foundation, and experience the magic of coloured luster pigments, as they capture and reflect the light off your skin. \u00a0The champagne hue of the Argan Enlightenment Illuminizer matches the natural glow of healthy skin, and the creamy application offers a uniform spread. The pump packaging holds 15 mL of product, and retails for $26 on Sephora.\n\n\nOpt for a sun-kissed tint or a buildable intense glow, with the Custom Enhancer Drops brought to you by Cover FX. Formulated with high-definition and ultra-refined pearls, you can either use the highlighter alone or add two customizable drops on top of your powder, your regular foundation or your favourite skincare product, for a liquid metal finish. The luminosity increases with the number of drops, so you have ample opportunity to customize your ideal glow to complete your overall look. Use a beauty sponge, brush or simply your fingertips to use the product. The Cover FX Custom Enhancer Drops comes in a nifty dropper-accompanied bottle, that retails for $42.\n\n\nGet an effortless, all-over dewy, and natural glow, with the Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector\u00ae Liquid Highlighter that\u2019s infused with ultra-refined, light-reflecting pearls. With a unique highlighting formula inspired by the fresh, flattering glow of a \u00a0sunrise, this highlighter can be used in two ways: a) Stand-alone, where you use your preferred beauty tool to apply the highlighter to the high-points of your face, especially cheek bones and bridge of the nose. b) Mix it with your favourite moisturizer, foundation, or primer for the added illumination.
