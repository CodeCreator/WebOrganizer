She was diagnosed with Type I diabetes at the age of 9 years old. Soon after her father died of heart disease suddenly and unexpectedly, the day after her 12th birthday. This set off years of depression fueled by food addiction, and by the age of 15 Daniele weighed over 200 lbs. She got\u00a0tired of\u00a0hearing that she could not live a \u201cnormal\u201d life with diabetes, and that limb loss and a plethora of other complications were inevitably in her future; she decided that she had enough and was ready to accept a new truth for her life.\n\nWhat followed\u00a0was years of extensive and consistent research, learning, and training, both physical and mental, in order to achieve the body, health, and mindset she so desired. But that wasn\u2019t enough. Her incredible personal \u00a0transformation from obese to athlete spurred her passion to help as many people as possible obtain the results that she did without going through the same struggles. True You Fitness and Diabetes Dominator are the realizations of those dreams. Coaching, training, accountability, and motivation via a repeatedly proven system that continues to work for people from all walks of life. The first step in any health plan is to get in the right MINDSET, followed closely by understanding\u00a0what\u00a0foods to eat, and that\u2019s why she offers her Diabetes Dominator Coaching program, to help those that are ready to make healthy sustainable lifestyle changes.\n\nDiabetes Dominator Coaching Superhero Logo v6Click Here to learn more\n\nThe Diabetes Dominator System \u2013 And your FREE 8 to Dominate 29 page eBook\n\nTakes the guess work out of achieving the real results you desire.\n\nHave you ever struggled with your weight or with managing your diabetes?

We all have the power to turn adversity into advantage. Diabetes can be a catalyst for improving our lives, paying closer attention to what matters most in life, and for being of service to others.

        "text":"Imagine waking up blind.\n\nOne moment you can see, and in the next moment, your vision is made up of only childhood memories.\n\nAt the tender age of 16, this became a reality for Ben Pettingill when overnight he lost 98% of his eyesight to a rare genetic syndrome, Lebers Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. Running on adrenaline and shadowed by denial, Ben believed that he was just living a nightmare and that he would wake up one morning and be able to see again. He soon came to realise that this was not the case. His syndrome is incurable and he will be blind for life.\n\nWhile the shock, then grief of losing one's eyesight cannot be discounted, once Ben processed his new reality he realised that he had to make a choice that would define the rest of his life. Ben came to learn that a blind man could see, and his miracle was the activation of True Vision and Limitless Vision; vision powered by mindset as opposed to eyesight.\n\nHarnessing the True Vision and Limitless Vision mindsets whilst developing resilience in the face of adversity has been paramount to Ben's happiness. He'll be the first to tell you that if he could, he wouldn't go back and change what happened to him because without losing his eyesight, he would not have gained the life he lives today.\n\nBen is the guy who water-skis with direction through an ear piece, coaches\u2019 basketball teams without being able to see the ball, has trekked the Kokoda track with plans to do it again (and again) and has even driven a car! He is not limited by his circumstances and his potential is infinite. He is the only legally blind person in the world to have competed in a Spartan obstacle course race, untethered, and water-skied the Southern 80, the fastest water skiing race in the world. Overall, Ben views life as an oasis of opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nWhile Ben may not be able to see physically, what he can see is that life has no limits other than what we impose on ourselves and on others, and it is up to us to create the life that we \u2018see' for ourselves. There was a time when Ben believed that all the dreams he had for himself were impossible but that certainly is not his belief now.\n\nHe may not be the helicopter pilot that he always dreamed of being but instead he lives out the full time dream job he never knew he had as a professional, motivational speaker. Ben get's to change peoples lives for the better by sharing his learnings and providing a new perspective on life to corporate and education audiences on a daily basis. A far greater and more widespread impact than he could have had whilst flying a chopper!\n\nAnd he may not play footy (AFL), cricket or basketball anymore but that doesn't stop this sports fanatic from following each code avidly. Ben has simply substituted his love for team sports for adventure sports like water skiing, mountain bike riding, hiking and obstacle course racing to still get his much needed outdoors and physical activity fix.\u00a0\n\nAnd while he once believed that he would be unloveable and nothing but a burden, he has since crushed that way of thinking and now lives in Melbourne with his girlfriend Amy and their dog, Aussie, and they're creating a bright and positive future for themselves.\n\nYou see, Ben's just you're typical Australian guy with some added guts, an extra shot of adrenaline and a whole lot of motivation to prove to himself and to others that life really is limitless.",

I have also undertaken consultancy work for private companies involved in litigation and disputes.\n\nAs a partner in a law firm it was part of my role to develop my team in terms of its expertise, the business it attracted and the personal development of the individuals who worked within it. Successful organisations are becoming increasingly aware that they need to understand the psychology of the organisation, their relationships with trading partners, clients and their people if they wish to meet and exceed their organisational objectives.\n\nI believe that the psychological health and the emotional intelligence of the people within an organisation is what leads to best practice and exceptional performance, in every area. I also believe it is what determines a satisfying life.\n\nThe coaching that I offer is underpinned by my training as a psychotherapeutic clinician and my experience of running a demanding business, serving business and individual clients. The coaching process is about working out with a client what he or she would like to achieve and the action he or she needs to take to achieve it.\n\nThe psychotherapy that I offer is psychoanalytically informed and practically focused to help a client bring about change through an improved understanding of how his or her mind works.\n\nEach section of the website tells you more about the different approaches to help you decide which you think would be best for you.\n\nI am a Registered member of British Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists (BACP), a Senior Practitioner Coach and member of the European Mentoring and Coaching Council (EMCC), accredited mediator and I remain a non practicing solicitor.\n\nI am always happy to discuss the services that I offer with prospective clients, informally, without obligation and in absolute confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Somers Resolution 2017 | Website disclaimer | Use of cookies\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Somers Resolution 2014\n\nWebsite disclaimer | Use of cookies",
