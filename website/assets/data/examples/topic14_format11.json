        "text":"The disappearing art of handwritten letters\n\nRecently, I sat down to write a short note of thanks. I noticed how difficult it was for me to make my writing legible. I spend most of my days writing, but like so many I don\u2019t actually write. I type on a keyboard. I sign my name hundreds of times a year. I dash off a short note now and then. I cannot, however, remember the last time I actually wrote a letter. When I do sit down to hand-write more than a couple of sentences, I almost feel as if I\u2019m back in grade school practicing cursive letters. I don\u2019t believe my situation is unique. Fast e-mail and increasingly costly postage has changed the way we communicate. The art of handwriting letters is fast disappearing.\n\nLittle attention is given to ordinary, handwritten letters as a collectible. Letters written by the famous or letters describing historically significant events have long been collected, but every day letters hardly get any attention at all. Some early letters, from the 1820s or 1830s, appeal to some collectors because of their age, but later handwritten messages just aren\u2019t of much interest to most.\n\nI don\u2019t know if run-of-the-mill handwritten letters will ever be a popular collecting area, but it\u2019s an area that definitely deserves a look. I\u2019m sure there are a few collectors out there who are already seeking such pieces, but collecting such material doesn\u2019t even occur to most. I think collectors are missing out on a very enjoyable collecting experience by failing to note the value of the handwritten word. Ordinary letters don\u2019t make impressive display pieces. They don\u2019t make especially good conversation either. While I sometimes tell other collectors about my T.E. Lawrence letter, I seldom mention the letter of a little known individual I have that describes a fishing trip. Such letters can be filled with nostalgia, however. True, some are of little interest, but others make for fascinating reading. Even the events of everyday life back in the 1890s or 1910s will be of interest to most of us. The people who wrote these letters lived in a different world.\n\nOne great advantage of collecting such letters is that they are cheap. Purchased in lots, they often cost less than a dollar each\u2014sometimes much less. Depending on where one looks, they can be difficult or easy to find. Ordinary handwritten letters seldom show up at flea markets, antique shows, antique shops, or malls. Most dealers don\u2019t consider them desirable enough to handle. They are difficult to find at most yard and garage sales, too. Unfortunately, most people consider such old letters trash. A great many are simply tossed, which is quite a shame.\n\nAuctions are the one source where handwritten letters are easy to find. Now and then I spot a box of old correspondence at a local sale. Usually, there is little interest in such lots and they sell for no more than a few dollars. The only real competition for such material is stamp collectors who may be after some of the stamps on the letters. Some lots may bring a hefty price from time to time, but that is the exception to the rule. Most often boxes of old letters sell for a song. While auctions are a good source, don\u2019t expect to find something at every sale. It may be necessary to attend several sales to find a good lot. On the other hand, you might get lucky.\n\nAnother good auction source is eBay. While eBay nearly always has something of interest to offer, finding single hand-written letter or large lots of them can be difficult. The problem arises due to the lack of good search words. Run-of-the-mill handwritten letters don\u2019t easily fall into the eBay categories either. They are autographed material, but only some are found in the autograph category. There are paper collectibles categories, but none of them exactly fit. It\u2019s usually best to search a wide area of eBay for letters of interest. I tried searching all the categories for \u201chandwritten letter.\u201d Usually, such a general approach isn\u2019t advisable as the matching auctions can number in the thousands. My effort realized only 112 items, however, quite manageable. A good many of the auctions were for letters written by the likes of Charles Dickens and Jefferson Davis. There were quite a few lots of interest, however. Some of these were single early letters with minimum bids of $10-$20.\n\nOthers were for lots of letters, some of them numbering in the hundreds. When I expanded my search to include the description as well as the title, the results increased to 794. Most of the additional lots had nothing to do with the handwritten letters I was seeking, however.\u00a0 I next tried searching only the Collectibles category. This yielded 80 lots\u2014347 when I widened the search to include the item description. This I found to be the most productive search. When seeking handwritten letters it may be worth your while to play around with search words. You may well come up with some that will yield better results that \u201chandwritten letter.\u201d The good news about the difficulty in finding lots on eBay is that they will be difficult for others to find, too. This will increase your chances of getting a good deal.\n\nChances are you won\u2019t want to keep all the letters you buy. As with all antiques and collectibles, it\u2019s best to go for quality, not quantity. Quality pieces in this collecting area include letters that are of special interest (for whatever reason), collections of correspondence the cover a period of years, and examples of especially fine hand-writing. These are the real treasures and are the items one should keep.\n\nWhile most of a collection of handwritten letters won\u2019t lend itself to impressive display, exceptional examples of fine hand-writing are quiet attractive, especially when framed and matted. We live in a world of typed and verbal communication. The art of hand-writing is dying. Very few now have the impeccable hand-writing that was once so valued. Some hand-written letters from the past border on calligraphy. They are true works of art. Someday, they may even be valued as such.\n\nWhile a collection of hand-written letters may not be valuable in monetary terms, it should be protected from damage all the same. Avoid storing letters where they may draw moisture. Beware handling them too often as the acid on your fingers will damage the paper. Never tape or glue any paper collectible. Avoid direct sunlight at all costs. Nothing will destroy a vintage letter faster than being hit with direct sunlight for even an hour a day.\n\nChances are that a collection of hand-written letters will not appreciate in value a great deal. There could be a sudden surge of interest, of course, but I wouldn\u2019t advise anyone to expect great monetary profit. Collecting isn\u2019t about profit, however, it\u2019s about enjoyment and nostalgia. Collecting old hand-written letters will provide plenty of both and at little cost, too! It\u2019s nice to know that some inexpensive collectibles are still out there.\n\nClick here to discuss this story and more in the message boards.",

Instead, light pours into rooms from a pair of walled courtyards.\n\nThe home's fortress-like exterior walls feature wrought-iron window grills and light fixtures. Past a wrought-iron gate and stately wooden doors, a two-story foyer offers a first glimpse of design elements found throughout the home, delicately stenciled oak beams, hand-carved corbels, stucco walls and Mexican tile.\n\nA staircase of rust-colored poured concrete winds under a stained-glass Don Quixote, a recent addition that was built to mirror tiles painted by Mexican artist Pedro Sanchez that sit above the fireplace in the library.\n\nThe library and a living room flank the entry, and both showcase another Smith trademark: carved wooden shutters covering large rectangular windows that face interior courtyards. Beyond the entry, a towering Moroccan door leads to a formal dining room.\n\nThe updated kitchen features a breakfast area, recessed lighting, blue and white Mexican tiles and colorfully stenciled white beams. It opens directly to a huge family room with a vaulted ceiling.\n\nUpstairs, the master bedroom looks out over a large grassy courtyard, with palms, fruit trees, a tiled fountain, an arched loggia and a discreet \"courting area.\" The master bathroom has been updated with a walk-in closet and oversize steam shower.\n\nThree other large family bedrooms are in this upstairs wing, all with balcony access. The remaining three bedrooms were originally servants' quarters. They are reached by a kitchen staircase and are connected to the other upstairs rooms only by an outdoor balcony.\n\nTo submit a candidate for Home of the Week, send high-resolution color photos with caption and credit information on a CD and a detailed description of the house to Lauren Beale, Business, Los Angeles Times, 202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, CA 90012.

Some products that make one class of vinyl floor shine can make others dull.\n\nExpensive vinyl flooring products are generally thicker, softer and springier to the tread and much more resistant to staining, scratches, gouging and tearing.The best vinyl flooring also usually carries a longer and more effective warranty with fewer get-out clauses.\n\nThe customer's impression of how well any given vinyl floor lasts is usually proportional to the quality of the topmost wear layer.The thickness and nature of the wear layer varies considerably and it is virtually always thicker and less vulnerable to damage in higher priced vinyl materials.Most of the loss of shine and colour consistency in an ageing vinyl floor occurs because of microscratching by grit, sand and dirt, to which the most recently developed urethane finishes used for the wear layer are much more resistant than those used in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nTake care\nUnfortunately it is often assumed that daily, or even weekly brushing, wiping or washing and occasional buffing is all that is required to keep vinyl in good condition. Not so.\n\nSome vinyl floors may require thorough deep scrubbing using a rotary machine and proprietary nylon pad or suitable brush head to properly clean the floor.\n\nOther floors may benefit from having the remaining damaged seals and dressings removed to enable bright fresh coatings to be applied. Frequently, it is not fully understood that water based emulsion dressings are added not only to enhance the appearance but also to protect the floor surface.\n\nDust mats at every door opening on to vinyl flooring can help a lot by reducing scratching of the surface.They can also help minimise the high amount of staining that arises from the treading in of the sealants used for tarmac driveways.\n\nLife is hard\nAt the National Carpet Cleaners Association (NCCA) almost half of the association's 600 members now list Hard Floor Care among their floor cleaning specialties.The NCCA also runs a hard floor care training course to teach members new to the industry how best to approach the maintenance and repair of vinyl.\n\nThe extent of refurbishment needed for any particular floor relates to the actual damage, the type and location of the floor.What has also improved within the last 12 months is the ability to deal with surfaces that were previously considered beyond redemption. Instead of tearing these floors out, replacing the sub-floor and supplying and laying new vinyl, it is now possible to carry out 'Full Restoration'.\n\nShould you want to learn more about this system or if you would like more information about vinyl and resilient floor care, feel free to call Keith Robertson direct on the number in the box.\n\nKeith Robertson is currently the training director for the National Carpet Cleaners Association. In addition, he is an IICRC (Institute of Inspection Cleaning Restoration Certification) trainer.\n\nHe writes extensively on floor care subjects while also having run his carpet cleaning and floor care company for the last 33 years.",

        "text":"Edit ModuleShow Tags\n\nAn Uptown Home With Style and Substance\n\nSeph and Pamela Dupuy\u2019s converted Uptown shotgun combines creativity and function.\n\nA garden cart is turned into a bar cart\n\nPhotographed by Sara Essex Bradley; Assistant Stylist H. Mitchell Settoon\n\nShotgun houses are the original flex plan homes. Most built in New Orleans are more than 100 years old, yet the layout of the rooms (except for kitchens and baths) allows one to use them as they wish. A bedroom might be turned into a dining room, or a living room might be turned into a bedroom. By adding room-specific furniture, one can choose the function of the room.\n\nYou never know what you are going to find behind the closed doors of a shotgun house. They may look humble and small from the street, but once you\u2019re inside, generous spaces are revealed and unraveled. Renovators today come up with clever solutions to adapt the shotgun house to modern needs. Open floor plans and additions that include new kitchens and family rooms \u2013 or maybe a luxurious master suite \u2013 are solutions used to enhance the classic enfilade layout of the original footprint of the shotgun house.\n\nPamela and Seph Dupuy have one of the most interesting shotgun house floor plans. Originally, the house was a five-room double. A formal double parlor separated by a central fireplace is at the front of the house. The Dupuys use one side as a music room and the other side as an office area. Both rooms are painted Bleeker Beige by Benjamin Moore, which is also the color used in several other rooms throughout this house. A drop leaf table is used as a desk. The desk can be cleared off, and the leaf dropped, to turn this part of the double parlor into additional salon space in the event of a soiree.\n\nThe dining table is set for 20 with a festive mix of the homeowners\u2019 various sets of china.\n\nThe most surprising room is the space used for the dining room. Walls were removed from smaller rooms, making one very long space that accommodates a dining table that can comfortably seat 20.\n\nPamela says, \u201cWhen the house was on the market, the long room with the bookshelves was shown as a living\/dining room combo. When we bought the house I put three furniture groupings in that space. Under the center chandelier, I had two love seats facing each other. Behind one sofa I had a large square table stacked with books, so that end was the \u2018library,\u2019 which we used occasionally for dinner parties (with two chairs on each side of the table for a total of eight). Behind the other sofa I had two fauteuils and a small table, which looked quite pleasing but saw little use.\u201d\n\nA drop-leaf table is used as a desk in the front parlor.\n\nThe entire room was of little use to the couple. She continues, \u201cIt was simply a long, lovely walk-through.\u201d\n\nPamela converted it to a dining room a couple years ago when she found a table at Crescent City Auction. \u201cI knew it would be perfect for the space, because it was long and narrow. I\u2019d missed having a defined dining room and couldn\u2019t wait to get that table in my house and start using it.\u201d\n\nKelly Wearstler throw on a French settee juxtaposed with a mid-century modern chair in the den; large blue pillow from Leontine Linens.\n\nThere is a small side hall next to the dining room, with two guest bedrooms and a guest bathroom off of it. This was the original part of the house. The family room, kitchen and a bedroom now used as Seph\u2019s office, as well as the powder room, were also part of the original house. The laundry and master suite comprise the new addition. A side porch comes off the family room, leading to a private garden. Adjacent to the family room, is the new master suite, with a walk-in closet, and a spa-like bathroom large enough to hold a comfortable armchair, where Pamela loves to leaf through design books and shelter magazines. There are two sets of French doors in the master bedroom, one leading to the side porch and one leading to the back garden.\n\nThe painting over the bed by Sandy Chism; bolster sham is from Leontine Linens; throw is from Shaun Smith Home.\n\n\u201cI love specific-use rooms,\u201d says Pamela. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of open floor plans although my den\/kitchen is a hybrid that works well. In my 20s I lived in a succession of New York City lofts and never felt comfortable. I remember thinking then how I couldn\u2019t wait until I was \u2018really grown up\u2019 and had a home with defined rooms \u2013 living, dining, den.\u201d\n\nPamela and Seph Dupuy knew each other for a number of years while they were married to other people. When their previous marriages ended, they met again socially, and a romance ensued, eventually leading to marriage. They both had lovely possessions to bring to their new home, combining two art collections, hundreds of books, furniture and an impressive collection of table settings. \u201cThis is the first house Seph and I bought together,\u201d says Pamela. \u201cWe specifically wanted a single-story home, and we were thrilled that this house was move-in ready, as it had been renovated shortly before we purchased it.\u201d\n\n\nPamela received her master\u2019s in arts administration from Columbia University, and the Dupuys\u2019 art collection is museum-worthy, quite customary in a city filled with people who support the arts. After combining their art collections, they added a few more pieces after they got married. They are especially fond of the works by Nell Tilton that they have purchased since buying this house. Other artists represented in their collection are Raine Bedsole, Sidonie Villere, Malcolm Moran, Mark Bercier, Dan Tague, Damian Aquiles, David Halliday, Sandy Chism, Jacqueline Humphries, John Geldersma, Douglas Bourgois, Sandra Russell Clark, Robert Gordy, Steve Rucker, Kathy Triplett and others. There is also a collection of 19th-century drawings they picked up during trips abroad. \u00a0\n\nPainting by Jacqueline Humphries; antique bench holds stacks of shelter magazines.\n\nPamela moved to New Orleans years ago to attend Loyola University, where she majored in journalism (mass communications and specialization print) before entering the master\u2019s program at Columbia. She zigzagged between New Orleans and New York for several years before settling down in Crowley. \u201cI adored my years in Crowley and am thrilled I had the privilege of raising my sons there. I lived in Crowley longer than I lived anywhere in my life (to date) and treasure my friends and memories from that small prairie town. Crowley is very similar to the small town in Arkansas where I grew up. We moved around when I was younger due to my father\u2019s job transfers. About every five years there was a relocation,\u201d she says.\n\nSeph, a native New Orleanian, graduated from Tulane with a degree in economics. He was raised on Henry Clay Avenue and experienced the childhood Pamela always craved: He grew up in one place, whereas she moved around and always longed for the friendships shared by classmates who had known each other since preschool. Seph has friends from childhood with whom he\u2019s still close. He briefly attended Spring Hill College in Alabama before transferring to Tulane. He raised his two children here, and they also reside in New Orleans along with their children. All his siblings live here, too.\n\nThe antique chest holds table linens; painting is by Mark Bercier.\n\nThe Dupuys\u2019 home is filled with a variety of styles. Laughing, Pamela says, \u201cI realize this mish-mash appears a bit schizophrenic. To say it\u2019s eclectic makes it sound like a designer-chic mix. Nothing in our home has great monetary value, but the sentimental value on most pieces is huge. Forget about insurance replacement costs. How do you value a bookcase left to you by your parents such as the one Seph holds so dear? What price do you put on a table that you paid so little for but which held the bottle of your firstborn night after night?\u201d\n\nPamela brought the pikulan pole, displayed on the mantel, home from a trip to the Republic of Myanmar in 1998. The painting is by William Parrot. The glass vases are from the New Orleans Museum of Art gift shop.\n\nPamela and Seph are avid readers. Pamela loves shelter magazines and design books. \u201cIsn\u2019t it fun to peer into the lives of others through photographs in magazines and books? \u00a0I look at interiors that I know I could never live in \u2013 either because they are completely not my style yet intriguingly beautiful all the same, or so costly that I could never afford the furnishings even if they fit my ideal. I simply enjoy the escape,\u201d she says. \u201cIf, and this is a big if, but if I had unlimited means, I\u2019d buy a David Adler or David Easton or Bobby McAlpine house and have it decorated just so,\u00a0and also have it landscaped to their exacting standards. Mr. Adler is deceased so I can\u2019t meet him, but my decorating bucket list is to have lunch with the other two. Yep, just lunch. I can\u2019t afford their houses! Oh, and cocktails with Miles Redd. I adore his work, but don\u2019t think I could live in it. Still, if he can party like he can decorate, I want to hang out with that guy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 Pamela volunteers for the Preservation Resource Center, the New Orleans Museum of Art, The Ogden Museum of Southern Art and the Historic New Orleans Collection. She has assisted with the PRC Shotgun House Tours and admires that the PRC values \u201cthese treasures which dot every neighborhood in the city.\u00a0Humble as they may be, the shotgun is ubiquitous in New Orleans.\u201d She also writes articles for the NVC (NOMA Volunteer Committee) newsletter and gives tours on occasion at the Odgen and gallery sits at the HNOC. Both she and Seph are in real estate. Seph has been in the real estate business for 40 years. His slogan is \u201cSeph knows Uptown!,\u201d and their home is a testament to that.\n\n1.

        "text":"Articles >\n\nLunch at the Tribeca Grill with: Jed Walentas\n\nPublished by The New York Sun on 2005-07-07\n\nJed Walentas is betting big on Brooklyn.\n\n\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" he said. \"It's a sensational opportunity. Brooklyn is going to explode.\"\n\nThe Walentas bet began 24 years ago as a relatively small wager - at least as far as real-estate deals go - when Jed's father, veteran developer David, bought 2.5 million square feet in a largely decrepit industrial area known as Dumbo, or Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. He paid $12 million.\n\nMr. Walentas is, of course, pleased that his only child now manages Dumbo. Jed Walentas also runs their privately-held company, Two Trees Management, on a day to day basis. By the time Jed - who's in his early 30's - completes Dumbo's revival, and also the regeneration of large parts of nearby downtown Brooklyn - in about five years - the Walentases will have spent some $500 million.\n\nIt's a safe guess that David Walentas' original investment - in which Leonard and Ronald Lauder were partners - has already been recouped, probably several times over. Many of the 1,000 or so apartments that Jed is creating in the converted industrial buildings command more than $800 a square foot. Some of those buildings date back to the late 19th century, when Dumbo was bustling with commercial and industrial activity.\n\n\"Any great neighborhood in the world always has intersections of lots of forces, tastes, cultures, and preferences,\" Jed Walentas said. \"My father invented the modern Dumbo, and I'm building on what he started. This is an evolving neighborhood - but our imprint will be here for a very long time.\"\n\nThat imprint - which has already transformed Dumbo into one of the city's most vibrant localities - was forged in much frustration and anxiety. David Walentas spent 17 years in trying to convince the city to rezone the area so that it could be put to use for residential purposes. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was instrumental in pushing through the rezoning in 1997.\n\nBy that time Jed Walentas had graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, with a degree in economics. But economics nor real estate wasn't where his true interest lay. It was in sports writing. He'd served as sports editor of the campus newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian. A job as a sportswriter awaited him at the New York Post.\n\n\"I decided to go with Donald instead,\" Mr. Walentas said.\n\n\"Donald,\" of course, was Donald Trump, who was so taken with Mr. Walentas' enthusiasm and ability to learn fast that he assigned him to a prime property that The Trump Organization was developing. The building was 40 Wall Street, which eventually became the first commercial edifice in New York to be fully wired for the Internet. Jed Walentas supervised much of the construction.\n\nThen came a call from his father. David Walentas thought that he was now in a position to carry out his plans for Dumbo, a waterfront area between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. A Scottish immigrant businessman named Robert Gair had originally built industrial structures there, including one containing a cardboard box factory which made a fortune for him. Indeed, the area was often referred to as Gairville.\n\nBut the neighborhood had deteriorated since Gair's time. There were artists who squatted in abandoned units. Dumbo's dark and winding streets were sometimes used by mobsters to dump bodies of the people they didn't get along with.\n\nThe Walentas' first conversion project in Dumbo was the Clock Tower Building, at One Main Street. They created 124 luxury condominiums in the 250,000 square foot structure in under a year. They raised a new 12-story building containing 54 apartments. They assembled 200 high-class apartments in three vacant loft buildings. And they upgraded 500,000 square feet for artist studios and commercial offices.\n\nA lucky streak came along. Stratospheric prices in Manhattan were forcing New Yorkers to look elsewhere; Dumbo's neighbor, Brooklyn Heights, had already regained its residential glory of a long-ago era - but property prices were edging upward to Manhattan levels. A buzz developed about Dumbo. The celebrated chocolatier Jacques Torres opened a store-cum-factory. Laudatory articles appeared in trade publications.\n\nAnd Dumbo was on its way to becoming an urban legend.\n\nThat status most certainly will be burnished as a waterfront park opens. Mr. Walentas is convinced that through the peculiar but intangible process by which people from different parts of the city relate to one another, Dumbo will \"connect\" to downtown Manhattan, which officials also want to develop further.\n\nSo what's it been like to generate that connection, beyond the long hours and the daily administrative burdens of running a real-estate company in New York?\n\n\"It takes patience,\" Mr. Walentas said. \"It takes long-term commitment to revive a neighborhood. Of course, it takes capital - and here we've been fortunate. And it takes a certain kind of dedication to the belief that the architecture of a historic neighborhood should be preserved in all its variety. I think we've done that. There's a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment in that.\"\n\nPranay Gupte,\nSenior Writer and Global-Affairs Columnist\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2003 - 2008, - by Fluid Design",

        "text":"Gardening column by R. Wayne Mezitt.\n\nEvery year around Mothers Day in the Boston suburbs, a welcome profusion of color bursts forth, even on branches that looked dead only a few weeks ago. Days are more consistently warm, the sun feels hot and plants everywhere are in bloom.\n\nFor many of us, the sight of evergreen azaleas producing blooms on their nearly-bare branches is a signal that spring has really arrived.\n\nIn most parts of New England, we can rarely expect the evergreen azaleas to display those broad sweeps of color pictured on those regal Southern estates. Here, in fact, these azaleas often come out of winter looking simply awful, with few of the \u201cevergreen\u201d features we'd want them to display. In Zones 7 and warmer, these shrubs can attain magnificent stature, retaining their foliage all winter with minimal discoloration. For those of us who enjoy golf, the Augusta National Masters tournament each April features the evergreen azalea as its \u201csignature shrub,\u201d unfailingly providing a memorable display. Sadly, the hardiness and climate tolerance of these southern beauties has never proven sufficiently reliable to rank the evergreen azalea as \u201cfoolproof\u201d in most of New England.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the evergreen azaleas can\u2019t be a valuable part of your landscape. Properly sited and given the care they need and time to become established, these plants can reward you with plenty of enjoyment to compensate for the extra attention they need. Make sure your soil drains off any water quickly and is properly prepared to be acid with a good organic content. Foliage on most evergreen azaleas will be damaged by drying winds and excessive winter sun, especially when the ground around the roots is frozen. Sunlight reflecting off the snow in February and March can be a major problem in some years. It\u2019s best to site them on the east or north side of a structure, at the edge of the woods or in front of a wind barrier where they are protected. Try planting along with plants that tolerate the winter well to help disguise their \u201crecovery\u201d time. And even if your azalea looks bad, make sure to wait until mid June to see if it recovers, which it often will, despite its appearance after the winter.\n\nStandard species and cultivars like Blaauw\u2019s Pink, Delaware Valley White, Hinocrimson (red, compact), kaempferi (bright orange-red, upright growing), kiusianum (purple or white flowers, dwarf and compact), Lorna (pink), poukhanensis (lavender, compact) and Stewartstonian (brick red, upright) are usually successful in local landscapes when properly grown. And some of the newer cultivars developed specifically for this region tend to tolerate somewhat better our winter conditions. Look for Abigail Adams (large pink), Bixby (bright red, dwarf and compact), Groundhog (pink), Majesty (wine-red, compact), Pink Clusters (profuse pink, dwarf ), Pink Discovery (clear pink, upright), Texas Pink (hose-in-hose red, dwarf) and Weston\u2019s Vyking (rose-red, compact).\n\nIf you\u2019ve been discouraged by how the azaleas look in your yard, you might consider an alternative \u2013 the Early Rhododendrons. These small-leaf rhododendrons appear very similar to the evergreen azaleas in many respects: profuse, small flowers right at the start of spring; small azalea-like foliage, compact growing, and a range of color choices. But more importantly, the Early Rhododendrons are bred and selected for the New England conditions. They perform well in sunny, exposed locations, with winter winds, colder winter temperatures and harsher conditions than most evergreen azaleas tolerate.\n\nYou\u2019re likely familiar with the ubiquitous Rhododendron \"PJM,\" that lavender-pink flowering shrub that appears in so many landscapes by early May. Also, Rhododendron \"Olga Mezitt\" is becoming more widely used for its clear pink flowers right around Mothers Day. PJM, Olga Mezitt and their numerous cousins have proven consistently foolproof in most landscapes in this region. And a good selection of Early Rhododendron cultivars is now available in pink, white, nearly red and lavender flowering forms, some even featuring double flowers. Most offer reliably attractive evergreen foliage that looks appealing all year, even in our most challenging winters.\n\nWhen you visit your local garden center, ask the experts there to recommend which plants they\u2019ve found to perform well in your area. This time of year is always such a fabulous experience outdoors, and there are so many plants to choose for adding color to your garden.\n\nR.

        "text":"| January\/February 1968\n\nF. NELSON BLOUNT, president and treasurer of Blount Seafood Corp. was found dead in the wreckage of his plane in Chesham, New Hampshire. The millionaire businessman owned two popular tourist attractions Steamtown U.S.A., a railroad museum at Bellows Falls, Vermont and The Edaville Railroad at South Carver, Massachusetts, New England's only surviving narrow-gauge line. He was known as much for his views on life as for his business success. This was sent to us by Henry McMillan, Galva, Illinois as he felt that many of our readers knew or had met Mr. Blount.\n\n\nIt is with deep regret that we report the sudden passing of a good friend and fellow collector, Melvin Snyder, of West-land, Michigan, who was called to his heavenly home on August 31, 1967. Melvin was born on a farm in what is now the City of Livonia, Michigan on June 22, 1915, and lived all of his life not far from his birthplace.\n\nHe was a toolmaker by trade and in addition had his own fully equipped machine shop, and it's facilities were always available to any of his friends who availed themselves of this service a good many times over the years.\n\nMelvin was a born collector with several antique autos, two fire engines and a number of gas engines and small steam engines - he was a member of the Early Engine Club.\n\nHe was the owner of a fine 25-45 Nichols and Shepard steam engine, this engine was pictured on the front cover of the Iron-Men Album in it's January-February 1967 issue. Melvin was an ardent steam fan and visited many steam shows including those in Iowa and in Canada. Left to mourn his passing are his wife Alice, his son Duane and his many friends.\n\n(Sent in by Earl B. Davison - Detroit, Michigan).",
