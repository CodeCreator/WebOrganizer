        "text":"Top Ten Ways To Lose Your Voir Dire\n\nPosted on August 1, 2016\n\nVoir dire is an extremely important part of any trial. It\u2019s not hard to lose a case in voir dire. Here are 10 ways to lose voir dire.\n\nLet your opponent take charge of the courtroom and leave you behind, sending the message to jurors that what you say or do don\u2019t matter as much as your opponent and that the jurors can rely on the opponent more than on you.\n\nDon\u2019t take the opportunity to speak with prospective jurors and leave the talking to others even when you have the opportunity.\n\nLet your opponent \u201crehabilitate\u201d a favorable juror without fighting vigorously or quickly enough to keep them. When the opponent says, \u201cBut you can be fair, right?\u201d and then rushes them back to the panel, if you don\u2019t intervene on the spot, you may not get another chance.\n\nWaste precious time talking about things that don\u2019t matter. Ask questions only out of curiosity and spend prospective jurors\u2019 precious time irrelevantly. This will yield little useful information, yet elicit resentment and impatience from potential jurors before the case even starts.\n\nTalk more and listen less. You will learn less about the panel members and then will have to decide whom to strike on insufficient information.\n\nDon\u2019t ask the same questions to all prospective jurors so you can compare apples-to-apples. Instead of having the same yardstick, you end up with a mishmash that isn\u2019t very useful.\n\nAsk personal questions without assurance of privacy. Most people are unwilling in open court to volunteer sensitive information, so they will remain below the radar and you will have an incomplete sense of their backgrounds.\n\nIgnore body language, nonverbal behavior, writing samples \u2013 everything other than their words. Many times, someone\u2019s true nature comes out more in non-words than in words. How they dress, how they write, their spelling or misspelling, whether they are on time or late, what they read, whom they associate with, whether they go on breaks to smoke, etc.\n\nIgnore social media. It turns out that people are more likely to present their real selves rather than their idealized selves on social media, which may thus provide a more candid view of the panel members than their pat answers in an unfamiliar setting such as the courtroom.\n\nDon\u2019t ask follow-up questions. For example, if you ask, \u201cWho is an environmentalist?\u201d many will raise their hands, but if you ask, \u201cWho here pays dues to an environmental organization, or contributes time or money to it?\u201d most drop their hands, and those who don\u2019t are the ones that matter. Or, if you ask if people believe there are too many frivolous lawsuits nowadays, many will raise their hands, but if you explain as plaintiff what your case is about, then ask who thinks that seems frivolous, most will drop their hands. If you rely on the first answer, you will be misled.\n\nWhen it comes to court reporting, NAEGELI Deposition and Trial provides the highest quality of professional nationwide and Seattle, Washington court reporters. As one of the only court reporting firms to supply you with an audio transcript free of charge, we also provide 100% verifiable transcripts.\n\nSource: The National Trial Lawyers \/ \u201cTop Ten Ways to Lose Voir Dire\u201c \/ By By Laurie R.

        "text":"Reasons Your Driver\u2019s License Can Be Suspended\n\nPosted By on Jun 27, 2016 | 0 comments\n\nDriving without a license is illegal in the United States as well as anywhere in the world. Once revoked, it will restrict you from going to places you want to go. A\u00a0suspended license may keep you from going to work or school or performing daily tasks. In this article, we will cite several reasons your license can be suspended.\n\n  1. You have accumulated too many driving points\n\nEach state has a certain point system that assigns points to minor and major traffic offenses. When you have reached a certain number of points within a set period of time, you could end up driving without a license.\n\n  1. Repeated Offenses\n\nAnother reason your license can be suspended is when you commit the same violation multiple times already. In some states, for example, your license can be revoked if you commit a certain number of reckless driving offenses within a given period of time. Depending on your state, you could be dubbed as a \u201chabitual offender\u201d after reaching a certain number of convictions.\n\n  1. You have been charged with a serious offense\n\nWhile this may vary from one state to another, some serious offense will merit an immediate revocation of your license. These offenses may include DUI, DWI, felonies involving a motor vehicle, vehicular manslaughter, and others.\n\n  1. Inaccurate Driving Record\n\nInaccuracies in your driving record may include the following:\n\n  \u2022 A higher number of accumulated points than you actually have\n  \u2022 Traffic tickets that you won or the judge dropped because of your completion of traffic school\n  \u2022 DUI convictions that you won or which you got an acquittal verdict\n  1. You have no insurance\n\nIf you were caught without insurance or at least a certificate of insurance, your license can be suspended.\n\n  1. A Simple Case of You Forgot\n\nMaybe you are aware that you are supposed to pay a fine or attend traffic school but you simply forgot.\n\nWhen your driver\u2019s license has been suspended, you may be required to do the following:\n\n  \u2022 Stop driving for a certain period of time\n  \u2022 Enroll in a defensive driving course or traffic school\n  \u2022 Obtain SR-22 from your insurance carrier\n  \u2022 Settle the reinstatement fee\n\nThe best way to keep your license to be revoked is to be a responsible driver and follow traffic rules and regulations.\n\nSubmit a Comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Digital sovereignty and privacy do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for bodycam systems\n\nBodycams have proven to prevent, reduce and resolve frontline aggression for various professions and organisations that apply them. But how to do that in accordance with privacy laws and digital sovereignity policies?\u00a0\n\nBodycams ZEPCAM round below\n\nThis is answered by privacy- and bodycam experts, researchers and advisors who are keen to explain the difference between respecting privacy standards on paper and in practice. So what do they consider the most important bodycam do\u2019s and don\u2019ts regarding privacy and digital sovereignty?\n\n1. Know the rules\n\nFirst of all, you need to know the rules of the game and apply them to bodycams correctly. This can prevent unnecessary irritation and frustration due to the unintentional breaching of privacy laws of citizens as subjects and sometimes suspects in bodycam recordings. Recording someone means you are in essence breaching their privacy, unless there is a well specified and documented reason for it. Apart from being legal recordings, they must be indisputable to be accepted as evidence in court. This requires logging of the whole video chain and process of recording, managing and storing with \u2018who has done what, when and why\u2019. The definition, interpretation and restrictions differ per country and sometimes regions or profession, even within the EU under GDPR. So know your local rules for your specific application of professional bodycams.\n\n2. Do your research\n\nOrganisations implementing a bodycam solution need to consider and resolve issues with context, policy and technology in that order. If one of these issues is neglected, it will not work. To understand policy driving technological requirements and restrictions, one has to know the cultural context: what is the level of mutual trust between citizens and law enforcers? Who needs to be protected against who? In Europe, citizens generally trust the professionals making them comply with laws with objectivity and integrity. Bodycams will be seen as an acceptable instrument for professionals to protect and support themselves against those that do not want to comply.\n\nIn the US, there is mutual mistrust and therefore a lot of regulation at federal, state and local level in internal guidelines and policies, which can differ per police force. There are situations (such as those involving minors) which are often strictly forbidden to record and situations which, on careful consideration, might prove useful to film. States such as Washington consider bodycam images as public records to ensure transparency and accountability. This means police officers of the Seattle Police Department were forced to actively publish their bodycam recordings, for which they created a YouTube channel. In response, some other US States have decided to declare bodycam images \u2018police records\u2019 instead of \u2018public records\u2019, in an attempt to ensure the privacy of the public.\n\nIn the European Union, you are not permitted to secretly film people (except for investigations) and your camera must be visible at all times. Your reason for filming must have a legal foundation and be logged. You can either film in the public interest as a public authority, or as legitimate private interest to protect employees as a company.\n\n3. Do leave legal and privacy issues to experts\n\nYou should allocate legal and privacy issues to employees who understand them. Those specialised in tech know a lot about bodycams, software, storage and data, but hardly anything about privacy. They don\u2019t think carefully enough about the necessary administration, documentation and registration, and may too easily copy\/paste from others. This often leads to fundamental errors and confusion, preventing a legitimate application of bodycam systems and recordings that will stand up in local courts of law. Privacy expertise may instruct technology on how to ensure compliance. Encryption of videos when stored on the bodycam or on a server, is a way of preventing them being seen by unauthorised people without a legal reason to do so. Not having a screen for on-device reviewing and sharing of videos is another, including any bystanders, witnesses and suspects overhearing the video and possibly spreading what happened on social media or changing their statements. The most safe way remains central decrypting, viewing, selecting, storing and logging of videos by authorised professionals with a legitimate reason.\n\n4. Don\u2019t just pay lip-service to privacy on paper\n\nIt is not about what lawyers have written down on paper, but how professionals use bodycams in practice. Privacy awareness in the heads of professionals is more important than having the necessary documents on your computer hard-disks. Research showed that 4 out of 6 police officers filmed inside homes in Amsterdam, while this is forbidden. You need to actively train bodycam-users in laws and regulations. Make sure you have one or two ambassadors in each workplace who can explain and monitor compliance to their colleagues. Don\u2019t just copy and paste documents, but think about how the use of bodycams assures compliance with laws and regulation in your practice. It\u2019s essential to make sure you don\u2019t just have legal knowledge but have that applied by bodycam users and ensured in the selection of the bodycam system and provider.\n\n5. Do ensure digital sovereignty of your bodycam provider\n\nThe Court of Justice of the EU has ruled in the Schremms-II case that protection granted to personal data in the European Economic Area must travel with the data wherever it goes. Transferring personal data to other countries (for instance the US or UK), will only be allowed if they abide by similar strict rules. Due to the Patriots Act in the US and Brexit of the UK this is no longer certain. The \u201cquick fix\u201d to contractually force your bodycam system provider to store the bodycam-data on servers within the European Economic Area is not enough. This is because they will still have unsupervised access to the software and thus data within the EEA\/EU from outside the EEA\/EU; a \u2018tunnel\u2019 into your \u2018data vault\u2019. To ensure digital sovereignty, one should demand that the video management software is provided, supported and maintained from within the EEA\/EU. Just like Australia has done by law and a newspaper editorial proclaimed after it came out that Huawei had access to mobile phone conversations in the Netherlands.\n\n\nIn conclusion, it\u2019s important to not only respect privacy on paper but put it in practice. Staying up to date on privacy-related affairs and doing your research will only benefit your organization. The legal definitions and regulations on how to use bodycams are important to know and apply, so that bodycam recordings have the legal foundation for preventing, reducing and resolving conflicts. It is crucial to provide law enforcement officers and their managers with guidance and training on when and how to use a bodycam and its recordings in compliance with privacy laws and regulations. To guarantee that your bodycam operation complies to the GDPR privacy laws, make sure your bodycam provider stores, supports and accesses your video data and also the software from within the EEA\/EU for digital sovereignty.\n\n>> Our Bodycam Solutions\n\nShare This",

Here are our favorite stories about guns\u2014from the Kalashnikov to robot-operated weapons\u2014and the notorious (and sometimes stoned) people who traffic them.\n\nEd Leibowitz \u2022 Los Angeles Magazine \u2022 February 2001\n\nA profile of the late actor-turned NRA president:\n\n\u2018Actor! Author! Civil Rights Champion! Patriot!\u2019 the film's narrator cries above the trumpets' blare. \u2018He hasn't just spoken the word of God, he's also spent his life defending the freedoms God has given us. Today, with your rights under the fiercest attacks in history, Heston is there.\u2019\n\n\u201cA figure emerges from the wings, more than six feet tall but appearing shorter, his torso inclined forward. Speedo propylene beach slippers make the journey to the podium with hesitant steps. Hip-replacement surgery and old age have dampened the fabled dynamism: no more battles with broadswords; no more chariot races for him. But above the uncertain legs, the chest is still massive, the cheekbones still chiseled, the broken nose as resolute as the NRA eagle on all those baseball caps bobbing above the crowd. As Charlton Heston approaches the microphone, his lungs swell, the vocal cords making their splendid, vibrant music out of ordinary air. \u2018I'm inclined to quit while I'm ahead,\u2019 he jokes. \u2018But I won't. No!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\nC.J. Chivers \u2022 Esquire \u2022 November 2010\n\nAdapting from his book of the same name, Chivers traces how the design and proliferation of small arms, originating from the Pentagon and the Russian army, rerouted the 20th century:\n\n\u201cSince the AK-47, or Kalashnikov, had first surfaced, the American military had dismissed it as cheap and ineffective. But as this new weapon's cracking bursts were heard in battle each day, the Eastern bloc's assault rifle at last captured the Pentagon's attention. It marked the Kremlin's influence on how war was experienced by combatants of limited means \u2014 the Kalashnikov-carrying guerrilla, a common man with portable and easy-to-use automatic arms, was now in the field by the tens of thousands, and these men were outgunning American troops. To close the gun gap, the Pentagon rushed the M16 into service.\u201d\n\nEvan Ratliff \u2022 The New Yorker \u2022 February 2009\n\nMost military experts agree that robots, not people, will inevitably do the fighting in ground wars. In Tennessee, a high-end gunsmith is already there. The story of Jerry Baber and his robot army:\n\n\u201cWe sat in a pair of office chairs, and Baber grabbed a radio-signal remote control. He switched on the larger robot, directing it across the concrete floor until the treads bumped against my foot. On an LCD display behind Baber, I could see an image of my leg, transmitted by a camera under the robot\u2019s gun barrel. The gun then pointed at my stomach. He assured me that it was not loaded.\u201d\n\nGuy Lawson \u2022 Rolling Stone \u2022 March 2011\n\nHow two twentysomethings, equipped with the Internet and weed, ruled the lucrative world of weapons trading ... for a while:\n\n\u201cPackouz and Diveroli had picked the perfect moment to get into the arms business. To fight simultaneous wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq, the Bush administration had decided to outsource virtually every facet of America's military operations, from building and staffing Army bases to hiring mercenaries to provide security for diplomats abroad. After Bush took office, private military contracts soared from $145 billion in 2001 to $390 billion in 2008. Federal contracting rules were routinely ignored or skirted, and military-industrial giants like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin cashed in as war profiteering went from war crime to business model. Why shouldn't a couple of inexperienced newcomers like Packouz and Diveroli get in on the action? After all, the two friends were after the same thing as everyone else in the arms business \u2014 lots and lots and lots of money.\u201d\n\nAdam Winkler \u2022 Atlantic \u2022 September 2011\n\nOn America\u2019s relationship with the right to bear arms, from the founding fathers to the Black Panthers and the Ku Klux Klan:\n\n\u201cThe Text of the the Second Amendment is maddeningly ambiguous. It merely says, \u2018A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u2019 Yet to each side in the gun debate, those words are absolutely clear.\n\n\u201cGun-rights supporters believe the amendment guarantees an individual the right to bear arms and outlaws most gun control. Hard-line gun-rights advocates portray even modest gun laws as infringements on that right and oppose widely popular proposals \u2014 such as background checks for all gun purchasers \u2014 on the ground that any gun-control measure, no matter how seemingly reasonable, puts us on the slippery slope toward total civilian disarmament.\u201d\n\nPeter Landesman \u2022 New York Times Magazine \u2022 August 2003\n\nThe author sits down with notorious (and recently convicted) arms dealer Viktor Bout, Bout\u2019s brother, and a close friend:\n\nBout, who is 36, six feet tall and somewhat expansive in girth, nimbly made his way through the crowded lounge.

Bout opened his blazer. 'I don't see any guns,' he said with a shrug.

        "text":"Top 10 things about NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo\n\ndaniel-pantaleoPinLast week, Eric Garner \u2013 a Black husband and father of four from Staten Island, NY \u2013 was choked to death by NYPD officers. The brutal attack was caught on tape. As a result NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo has been stripped of his service weapon pending further investigation in connection with death of Mr. Garner.\n\nRecent reports show new evidence, Pantaleo has been accused of misconduct before. Read below, top-ten-things about him.\n\n#1 Daniel Pantaleo was videoed putting Garner in a chokehold \u2013a move banned by the NYPD\n\n\nHe is seen on video placing 46-year-old Eric Garner in a chokehold and bringing him to the ground with the help of three other officers Thursday outside of a Bay Street beauty supply store.\n\n#2 He was trying to place Garner under arrest.\n\n\nPantaleo\u2019s arm remains around Garner\u2019s neck even after the hulking Port Richmond man has been subdued by other officers who tried to arrest him for allegedly hawking untaxed cigarettes. Garner was pronounced dead at Richmond University Medical Center, West Brighton, shortly after the incident.\n\n#3 Garner\u2019s medical examiner has yet to determine the cause of death.\n\n\nUpon releasing his arm from Garner\u2019s neck, he proceeds to push Garner\u2019s face against the sidewalk with two hands as Garner gasps, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe! I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d\u00a0 Police have said that Garner went into cardiac arrest while in police custody.\n\n#4 He has been placed on modified assignment\n\n\nAn NYPD spokesman confirmed Pantaleo, has been stripped of his gun and shield, and will work in a non-enforcement capacity until further notice.\n\n#5 Is not the first time he is accused of misconduct!\n\n\nIt turns out that Garner\u2019s death, which has prompted a great deal of public anger at the police in general and Pantaleo in particular, is not the first time someone has accused the eight-year veteran of misconduct. The Staten Island Advance reports that Pantaleo has been sued twice for violating the civil rights of people he\u2019s arrested.\n\n#6 First Law suit: he was accused of strip-searching two men on a street\nIn the first case, two men \u2014 Darren Collins and Tommy Rice \u2014 said that Pantaleo and another officer strip-searched them on a Staten Island street, in the middle of the day, after pulling them over.\n\n#7 Second Lawsuit: he illegally arrested a man on the street\n\nThe details of the second lawsuit, which is still pending, are a bit unclear. The Advance reports that a man named Rylawn Walker sued Pantaleo this past winter for arresting him even though he was \u201ccommitting no crime at that time and was not acting in a suspicious manner.\u201d Walker, who faced ********* charges that were later thrown out, also claims that Pantaleo \u201cmisrepresented facts in the police reports and other documents that the plaintiff had committed offenses when in fact this was not true.\u201d\n\n#8 Charges of the first lawsuit against him were dismissed\n\nAccording to the 2012 lawsuit, Pantaleo and his colleague handcuffed Collins and Rice and then \u201cpulled down the plaintiffs\u2019 pants and underwear, and touched and searched their genital areas, or stood by while this was done in their presence.\u201d Criminal charges were eventually dismissed.\n\n#9 New York City shelled out $30,000 to settle the lawsuit against him\n\nThe city paid the men $15,000 each on the strip-searching case.\n\n#10 Pantaleo has been receiving online death threats.\n\n\nThe eight-year veteran NYPD officer who is a plainclothes officer, is being targeted in online death threats and a Facebook page called \u201cOfficer Daniel Pantaleo \u2014 Wanted Dead or Alive.\u201d",

        "text":"Top 10 Types Of Lawyers You Want To Know\n\nLawful morals is a term utilized to portray an implicit guidelines representing acceptable proficient conduct, which builds up the way of commitments owed to folks and to society. If you\u2019ve been seeking around trying to discover a lawyer to assist you resolve your certain legal difficulty, you\u2019ve most likely realized by now there are a lot of various types of lawyers. Other legal specialists such as court clerks and paralegals may possibly want to comprehensive vocational coaching applications. The court will make a decision soon after contemplating all variables like 1) the requirements of the wife \/ children 2) the living standard of the parties during marriage three) the revenue of the parties. They give free of charge legal tips to communities with unmet legal demands, particularly these unable to spend for legal solutions. The longer the case goes, the far more the costs they collect \u2013 but only to the extent that every single client can or will pay.\n\nCounselor at law- In the past at least in some U.S states there was a distinction amongst the term A Counselor at Law who argued the case in court and an lawyer who prepared the case but didn\u2019t argue it. My lawyer told me about it. Just make sure you get a letter from the firm stating their acceptance of the amount and that the debt is satisfied. It requires a lot of people performing various items to make a item that is prepared for sale. Also, the issue that a single struggles to discover the proper tool does not get considerably relief in this list. The Loved ones Court of Australia was one particular of the initial courts to recognise self-represented litigants as a permanent and significant client group. Then if you wrote it to a store go to the store and pay any outstanding costs they could have.\n\nBanks engage the solutions of this type of lawyers to recover cash owed by bad debtors. Demonstrated experience in organization and corporate improvement, sales and business operations, policies and procedures. You will almost certainly have to spend added for this, but it\u2019s certainly worth the cost. It may mold you to grow to be the greatest you want to be and to ace in almost everything not only to pass the crucial Bar Exam for lawyers in the Philippines but also to prepare for the real battle in the courtroom. Neither of which can be granted to a parent unless they go via the correct legal channels to get it completed and make issues legally binding. Lawyers in these departments may also have their own clientele and their personal offers or disputes. Lawyers nominee businesses: These firms act as trustees to hold securities for loans created on behalf of customers.\n\nI have created a list of ten queries that you should ask to help you get the answers you require to make a solid selection. Other lawyers sue when there\u2019s a copyright violation such as employing a song without the artist\u2019s permission. If you feel generous and want to spend for an hour of credit counseling (with a reputable firm\/individual) that is awesome. Thanks Jessie \ud83d\ude42 I consider absolutely everyone right here is ready for the battle in the court \ud83d\ude42 Cheers to all lawyers! These can be taken care of rapidly by either paying them or setting up an appointment to speak with the judge to make payment arrangements. When NJ is informed of DUI, they may impose added fines, charges and surcharges. The type of legal company you have will dictate which sort of lawyer you require.\n\nThe Judge then might wait or could have a clerk make a phone contact or will just reschedule it. The judge took less then a minute to make a bench selection after asking me a couple of concerns and consulting with Social Securities medical doctor. They draft and audit authorizing assentions, administration contracts, contracts carrying out with eminences and some other part of the entertainment company you can envision. The rules of a legal court are several, and most attorneys never even know all the rules. New Banks applying for a licence within the calendar year 2009 are required to spend an application fee of \u00a319,150 and by the final day of the month in which the licence is granted, pay a further pro rata fee of \u00a31,596 multiplied by the quantity of complete months in between the licensing date and the end of that calendar year. In a way I hope it does go to court to show what an true liar and devious particular person she genuinely is.",

        "text":"5 Things to Know About Applying for Social Security Disability\n\nApplying for Social Security disability can be a challenging endeavor, especially since the process is never truly black and white. There are many factors taken into consideration by the Social Security Administration (SSA), including work history, medical condition, and more.\n\nTo make your application process a bit more straightforward, we\u2019ve put together our top 5 tips to keep in mind when applying for Social Security.\n\n1. Claims Are Often Denied\n\nWe want to set a clear expectation \u2013 it is very common for your initial SSDI claim to get rejected. It could be related to any number of reasons and doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you don\u2019t qualify, so try not to feel defeated if this happens to you.\n\nA few reasons your claim might get denied could include:\n\n  \u2022 Incomplete medical records or records that don\u2019t support your claim\n  \u2022 Errors or inaccuracies with your application\n  \u2022 SSA isn\u2019t able to get in touch with you\n\nThe best thing you can do if your claim is denied is to either appeal or reapply, which we will discuss in more detail later in this article.\n\n2. Don\u2019t Wait to File Your Application\n\nThe longer you wait to file your application, the longer it will take to (hopefully) be approved. It\u2019s common for the application review process to take anywhere from 3-6 months, sometimes even longer.\n\nSince it\u2019s not guaranteed that you will be approved the first time, you\u2019ll want to prepare as best as you can to wait it out. If you get a second denial, you may get a hearing, although to be seen in front of a judge can take more than a year.\n\nBasically, the sooner you can get your Social Security benefits application submitted to SSA, the better!\n\n3. You Can Appeal If Initially DeniedHandicap Sign\n\nIf your Social Security benefits claim is denied, you will still be able to submit an appeal, though you\u2019ll want to keep in mind the deadlines for appealing are relatively short.\n\nThere are a few steps included in the process:\n\n  1. Reconsideration \u2013 Your same application is reviewed by a new disability officer. This must be done within 60 days of your initial denial.\n  2. Request a Hearing \u2013 If your second application has been denied again, you can request a hearing before a judge, called an administrative law judge (ALJ). This must be done within 60 days of the denial.\n  3. Claim Reviewed by Appeals Council \u2013 This council will review the decision made by the ALJ to determine next steps.\n  4. File Lawsuit in Federal District Court \u2013 This is the final step of the process, although most cases never make it to this point.\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t panic \u2013 though this may seem discouraging, there\u2019s a decent chance your claim may still be approved farther along in the process. That said, it\u2019s in your best interest to file as soon as possible to get the ball rolling. If you don\u2019t file an appeal within the deadline, you won\u2019t be able to appeal with SSA.\n\n4. Document Your Condition Thoroughly\n\nYour medical condition is the most important factor considered when applying for Social Security benefits, so accurate documentation is critical for a smooth application process. Well-organized and detailed documentation can even help strengthen your case!\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be formal \u2013 keep it simple yet detailed. Note how you\u2019re feeling and how your current condition affects your day-to-day life. Make sure to tell all medical providers, counselors, case managers, etc. about these things. Some important details you\u2019ll want to document could include:\n\n  \u2022 Any illness or pain that you\u2019re experiencing\n  \u2022 Details of the occurrences related to your disability, such as:\n  \u2022 Date and time\n  \u2022 Type of incident (i.e. seizures or migraines)\n  \u2022 How long each incident lasts\n  \u2022 Circumstances that trigger each incident\n  \u2022 List of medications you\u2019re taking due to condition\n  \u2022 If any, side effects of current medications\n  \u2022 Description about the nature and severity of your pain \u2013 it\u2019s important to be as detailed as possible when describing your pain, as generalization is often not enough to get the point across\n\nBy being able to effectively describe your medical condition and the pain you\u2019re experiencing and making it part of your medical record, you can significantly improve your chances of being approved for disability benefits.\n\n5. Hire a Social Security Attorney\n\nApplying for Social Security disability benefits can be difficult to tackle on your own. If you\u2019re planning to apply, appeal, or reapply for benefits, it\u2019s best that you work with a disability attorney who can help you decide on the best approach to take. Having a professional disability attorney who understands the system can guide you through the documentation filing process, which can put you in a better position to receive disability benefits.\n\nThe professional attorneys at Woodruff & Mathis are available to help you develop your claim.

        "text":"In pictures: 12 scams of Christmas and how to avoid them\n\n'Tis the season for online scams. Here are 12 of the most dangerous scams you're likely to see this holiday season.\n\n  \u2022 The holiday shopping season is in full swing and so is the season for online scams. According to 2012 Holiday Shopping Study by McAfee and Harris Interactive, 70 percent of Americans will shop online this holiday season and 24 percent of Americans will shop online with a mobile device. That's a target that has cyber criminals salivating. Here are 12 of the most dangerous scams you're likely to see this holiday season, according to McAfee.\n\n  \u2022 Social Media Scams On the first day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me social media scams. People are often off-guard when it comes to social media networks like Facebook and Twitter because they're surrounded by \"friends.\" But your friends' accounts could be hacked and sending out fake alerts. Be careful when you click or like posts, enter raffle contests or install apps to receive discounts. Beware fan page deals that you get from your friends that advertise the hottest holiday gifts or Twitter ads and special discounts that use shortened links that could be malicious.\n\n  \u2022 Malicious Mobile Apps On the second day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me malicious mobile apps. Smartphone and tablet owners love their apps\u2014they've downloaded more than 25 billion apps for Android devices alone. But they're not all safe. You could be downloading a malicious app designed to steal your information or send out premium-rate text messages. Get some information about the developer before you download.\n\n  \u2022 Travel Scams On the third day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me travel scams. If you find travel deals online that seem too good to be true, there's a good chance they are. Scammers build phony travel pages with beautiful pictures and bargain basement prices, all in an effort to get you to hand over your financial details.\n\n  \u2022 Holiday Spam\/Phishing On the fourth day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me holiday spam and phishing. Spammers and criminals engaging in phishing seek to tailor their messages to make you more likely to click. Expect to see ads for cheap Rolexes or pharmaceuticals that proclaim them the \"perfect gift.\" The real gift is likely malware, a stolen identity, theft or all three.\n\n  \u2022 Hot Holiday Gift Scams On the fifth day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me hot holiday gift scams. Certain items, like the iPhone 5 or iPad Mini, generate all sorts of buzz as the hot gift during the holiday season. Expect to see these must-have gifts mentioned in dangerous links, phony contests (\"click HERE for a free iPad!\") and phishing emails. Think twice before you click on a dubious link or reveal personal information.\n\n  \u2022 Skype Message Scare On the sixth day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me Skype message scams. Lots of people now use Skype to connect with their loved ones during the holiday season, and that makes it an attractive target for criminals. Beware emails about \"Skype toolbar for Outlook\" or purporting to come from \"Skype Security Center.\" They're seeking to install spyware or other malware to listen to your calls for personal information or even hold your files for ransom.\n\n  \u2022 Bogus Gift Cards On the seventh day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me bogus gift cards. Be careful when buying gift cards online from third-parties because they may well turn out to be fraudulent. Research the seller before buying. When in doubt buy gift cards directly from the source.\n\n  \u2022 Holiday SMiSishing On the eighth day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me holiday SMiSishing. That's a mouthful. It's phishing via text message in which the scammer tries to lure you into revealing information or performing an action you normally wouldn't do by pretending to be a legitimate organization. Think twice if that text message is not from a friend or an organization you've explicitly given permission to text you.\n\n  \u2022 Phony E-Tailers On the ninth day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave me phony ecommerce sites. These sites try to lure you into sharing your credit card number and other personal details by promoting great deals. Of course, you'll never receive the merchandise and your information will be stolen. As a bare minimum, if you visit an ecommerce site, make sure the browser address bar lights up green (indicating that it's been strictly validated with an Extended Validation Certificate) and look for a trust seal near the bottom of the page.\n\n  \u2022 Fake Charities On the 10th day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me fake charities. Every year people give generously to charity during the holidays, and cyber criminals want a piece of that action. One of the biggest scams every holiday season involves spam advertising fake charities in which the money goes directly to the crooks. Do some research on your charity of choice before you give.\n\n  \u2022 Dangerous eCards On the 11th day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me dangerous eCards. Criminals love eCards as a way of delivering spyware or viruses that download the moment you click on the link to view the greeting. Don't click these links unless you recognize the sender. Even then, it probably couldn't hurt to check whether the eCard provider is legitimate before clicking the link.\n\n  \u2022 Phony Online Classifieds On the 12th day of Christmas, cyber scrooge gave to me phony online classifieds. Many people turn to online classifieds as a way to find holiday gifts or part-time jobs to pay for them. But beware of offers that ask for too much personal information or ask you to wire funds via Western Union. These are most likely scams and frequently illegal. Fake work-from-home jobs that involve wiring money are one of the primary ways that cyber criminals launder their ill-gotten gains. And it could stick you with jail time to boot.\n\nShow Comments",

        "text":"Wednesday, June 24, 2015\n\nTop Things to Consider When Filing a Personal Injury Lawsuit\n\nIf you were involved in a crash or were otherwise injured at no fault of your own, you may wish to file a personal injury lawsuit against the other party. A lawsuit can help you regain lost wages, recover damages and gain peace of mind after a personal injury. Before filing a lawsuit, however. there are several things that you should consider in regard to expenses. After all, you do not want to leave a court case with less money than you had going in.\n\nFiling Fees\n\nWhen filing a personal injury lawsuit, you will be required to pay a fee for the petition. On average, a filing fee ranges between 10 and 50 dollars. In one payment, this is not much, but various filing fees over the course of an entire trial can stack up to over $1,000. Be sure that the reward of the case is large enough to offset this expense and prior damages.\n\nTime Off from Work\n\nIf you have returned to work after an injury, filing a lawsuit against another party will likely mean that you need to take more time off for the trial. This can result in more lost wages, so you need to be absolutely sure that the benefits of the case outweigh this.\n\nCopying Costs\n\nIn order to make a solid argument in front of the judge, you will need evidence in the form of medical documents, bills, and police reports. These will cost you money to get copied.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

Read these Florida men's stories, including crashing golf carts and lawnmower escapades.\n\nDrunk Driving: The weirdest inebriated Florida Man headlines\n\nDrunk drivers kill thousands of people every year on American roads, which is why driving under the influence is a serious crime. That said, Florida Man has a long rap sheet for bizarre and unusual drunk driving arrests we had to share. Here are some of the weirdest DUI arrests Florida police had to make recently.\u00a0\n\nThe lawnmower man\n\nA Florida man was spotted by police driving along a highway. Seems normal, except he wasn\u2019t driving a car. Police pulled this Florida man over while he drove a lawnmower. In the two-minute bodycam footage, the cheerful man says he knew he was on the road and had \u201ca couple\u201d to drink.\u00a0\n\nIn this friendly conversation, Florida Man said he was going home and coming from his house, pointing in opposite directions. During the sobriety test, the Florida man slurs that there\u2019s no need to breathalyze him, he\u2019s drunk, so he\u2019s coming in quietly.\u00a0\n\nThe Florida Man, Paul Burke, had three DUIs before police caught him drunk on his lawnmower, riding down the highway. Apparently, a lawnmower was the only thing he had to drive since his license had been suspended & revoked over the three previous charges.\u00a0\n\nMore Florida lawnmower men\n\nPaul Burke wasn\u2019t the only Florida Man to go for a drunken joyride on his lawnmower. Another Florida man imbibed in lots of beer and decided to take his John Deere to the shopping mall. Once there, this Florida man thought it would be a good idea to smash into a cop car.\u00a0\n\nUpon his arrest, he was asked if he wanted to make a statement. This Florida man\u2019s famous words? \u201cMy bad.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRolling through Starbucks\n\nThis Florida man was arrested for a DUI after ordering some coffee. Officers noticed him rolling away from Starbucks with a flat tire and a bicycle hanging off his car. When they pulled him over, they noticed a knife sticking out of his jacket. After a field sobriety test and having a machete in his car, this Florida Man got multiple charges with his grande coffee.\u00a0\n\nThe Florida Man who turned himself in\n\n911 Dispatch in Polk County, Florida got an interesting call from a Florida man who had no idea where he was. He wanted to call to turn himself in for drunk driving. While the dispatcher is trying to get Florida Man to pull over, he\u2019s insisting he can\u2019t, slurring that he doesn\u2019t know where he is.\u00a0\n\nEven better, this Florida man told the dispatcher that he was going to get something to eat in the middle of the 911 call. He said he was driving around, trying to get pulled over for a DUI. He also admitted to smoking meth.\u00a0\n\nThe Florida man, Michael Lester, had a long criminal history that included resisting arrest and battery.\u00a0\n\nThe Florida man who asked for directions\u00a0\n\nThis Florida Man flagged down a police officer to ask for directions to the nearest auto parts store. While this seems reasonable, this Florida man was drunk when he asked. When police administered a sobriety test, the Florida Man declared, \u201cYou didn\u2019t pull me over, I pulled you over!\u201d\u00a0\n\nThis Florida man, Juan Zamora, was arrested for a DUI, with an added charge for cocaine possession after cops found the drug in his car.\u00a0\n\nWe never heard this one before . . .\n\nAn Indian County, Florida Man was arrested for a DUI but insisted he was innocent. Why? Florida Man said he only drank at stop signs\n\nWhen police pulled Earle the Florida man over, he admitted to drinking \u201ca couple pulls of Jim Beam,\u201d but said it wasn\u2019t drunk driving since he only drank it at traffic lights and stop signs. His breathalyzer showed Earle\u2019s BAC was twice the legal limit in Florida and off to jail he went. He had two previous DUIs in Missouri.\u00a0\n\nDistracted by an alligator\n\nThis Florida man was only visiting when he claimed he was \u201cdistracted by an alligator,\u201d the reason he gave cops for being in a ditch. He also mentioned he had about six beers. Before he was arrested, he was kind enough to warn police about lions & leopards roaming around.\u00a0\n\nAfter he was arrested, this Florida man thought he was in a hotel. He asked the officer at the desk if he could check out of his room.\u00a0\n\nA DUI on a golf cart\n\nThis Florida man received his DUI while driving a golf cart down a highway. When police pulled him over, he handed them his membership card and didn\u2019t have a license at all. Not only did he blow above Florida\u2019s legal drinking limit, but he also blew a .339. Most people would be unconscious or dead with that much alcohol in their system!\u00a0\n\nShare via:\nNo Comments\n\nLeave a Comment",

        "text":"Show Mobile Navigation\nCreepy |\n\n10 Unsettling Facts About Japan\u2019s Creepiest Cult\n\nby Morris M.\nfact checked by Jamie Frater\n\nOn March 20, 1995, five men boarded the Tokyo subway carrying small packages of deadly sarin. As their trains approached the city center, each man calmly punctured his package with the tip of an umbrella and exited, leaving the sarin behind. The resulting cloud of nerve gas killed 12 people and injured as many as 5,500. The entire city was paralyzed. Hospitals overflowed. Subway stations resembled battlefields. It was the worst terror attack in Japanese history.\n\nBy summer, it was clear that Aum Shinrikyo was responsible. An apocalyptic cult built on a mixture of Buddhist and Christian teachings combined with yoga, the group had convinced its members that they needed to trigger an apocalypse as soon as possible. But the subway attack wasn\u2019t just a random one-off. It was the culmination of years of creepy incidents involving Aum, each one scarier than the last.\n\nFeatured image credit: Tsu\n\n10 The Brutal Sakamoto Murders\n\nDead Body\nIn 1989, Tsutsumi Sakamoto had every reason to be cheerful. His wife had just given birth to a baby boy, his legal career was taking off, and the young lawyer was making a name for himself taking on the new Aum cult in Tokyo. Then, in November, Tsutsumi and his family vanished. There was no note, no explanation, and no evidence. Japan\u2019s police groped blindly in the dark, unsure if the Sakamotos had simply cut and run or if something darker was at work.\n\nFast-forward to 1996. As part of the marathon series of trials following the subway gas attack, Aum member Tomomasa Nakagawa was cross-examined about the cult\u2019s past crimes. The disappearance of the Sakamoto family came up. Nakagawa\u2019s response was chilling. Fed up with the hotshot lawyer interfering in their business, Aum had decided to have Tsutsumi brutally murdered.\n\nThe original plan had been to kill him on his way home from work. Unfortunately, the date that the Aum leadership chose just happened to coincide with a public holiday. Rather than wait 24 hours, the six selected assassins decided to go to the Sakomoto home and finish the job.\n\nAt 3:00 AM, they entered the house. Tsutsumi and his wife were asleep in bed. One member strangled Tsutsumi, while another kicked his wife half to death before strangling her, too. Her last words were, \u201cPlease save the child, at least.\u201d Instead, the sect members located the baby and suffocated him with his bedding. They then drove the three bodies out into Japan\u2019s remote countryside and buried them in metal drums. Although Aum was suspected of being involved, the authorities failed to investigate properly. It wasn\u2019t the only time that the police let Aum get away with their crimes.\n\n9 Kidnapping And Extortion\n\nFor a newly emerged cult, Aum was surprisingly sophisticated about funding itself. Members would have to pay to reach enlightenment, and special seminars costing tens of thousands of dollars were regularly held. At one point, the group even began operating its own restaurant chain and selling computers. However, by far, the most common means of funding came from extortion.\n\nAt its most harmless, this involved blackmail on an industrial scale. Towns and cities across Japan would be contacted and told that Aum planned to open a compound there. They were then given the option to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep the cult away. Most of them coughed up. More harmfully, the group entered into business with the Yakuza to manufacture and help sell illegal drugs.\n\nWorst of all were the kidnappings. Cult members would be quizzed over their families\u2019 earnings. If it turned out that they were related to someone wealthy, they would frequently be ordered to kidnap that relative. One innkeeper was taken hostage by his own daughters, tortured, and forced to hand over 60 million yen. The tactic was scarily effective. By 1995, the cult was estimated to have a net worth of around $1.5 billion.\n\n8 They Built Their Own WMD Testing Ground\n\nAustralian Outback\nWhen Australian Federal Police raided the Banjawarn ranch in 1995, it was like they\u2019d stepped into a nightmare. Remote parts of the property were littered with the carcasses of sheep that had died in agony. Tests revealed that they\u2019d been poisoned with sarin. In the abandoned house, policemen stumbled across a vast chemical weapons lab, primed to produce nerve gas. Horrifically, it began to dawn on them that they\u2019d uncovered a testing ground for weapons of mass destruction.\n\nPurchased by Aum in early 1993, Banjawarn had long been associated with suspicious activity. On May 28 of that year, local seismographs shot off the scale. A loud boom echoed out across the desert, followed by a rumble that was felt dozens of miles away. Locals reported seeing a fireball leap up into the sky. Following the 1995 raid, police discovered an active uranium mine on the ranch, leading some to conclude the explosion had been Aum testing its own crude nuclear weapon.\n\nWhile there is no concrete evidence that Aum ever came close to having a nuclear device, there\u2019s no doubt that Banjawarn saw some horrific experiments. The group was later found to have been creating anthrax and nerve agents like Soman at the ranch, some of which had been tested on the local wildlife.\n\n7 They Carried Out Multiple Germ Attacks\n\nHazmat People\nAs early as 1990, Aum\u2019s leadership was planning mass-casualty terror attacks. In April of that year, they modified a van to emit a fine spray as it drove and then loaded up with samples of botulinum toxin. The group then drove it through central Tokyo, spraying the Japanese parliament with one of the deadliest bacteria known to man.\n\nThanks to the cult\u2019s poor understanding of germ warfare, the attack released a harmless version of the bacteria. But it inspired them to greater, scarier heights. Two years later, the group managed to acquire some anthrax. A stupendously deadly strain of bacteria, anthrax can kill you in unimaginably gruesome ways. If you happen to get infected by inhaling it, you\u2019ll almost certainly die even with treatment. Aum took their anthrax samples, loaded them into giant aerosols, and tried to spray the whole lot over Tokyo.\n\nA successful anthrax attack could have killed thousands. Thankfully, Aum had accidentally acquired a vaccination strain that was harmless to humans. Less happily, the repeated failure of their germ attacks is what inspired them to move on to sarin. By 1994, they\u2019d successfully tested their new gas in the town of Matsumoto, killing eight people and wounding nearly 500.\n\n6 Gruesome Assassinations\n\nIn 1994, Tadahiro Hamaguchi became one of history\u2019s most gruesome firsts. On a late-night walk through Osaka, he became possibly the first person in history to be killed by VX.\n\nA nerve agent developed by the British after World War II, VX is so deadly that it makes sarin look like laughing gas. A single drop absorbed through the skin can kill you so fast that there would be no time to inject an antidote. For a brief period in the mid-1990s, Aum used it to murder their enemies.\n\nFrom 1994\u201395, more than 10 VX assassinations were carried out by the cult, usually by injection. The one man lucky enough to survive a spray attack was hospitalized for 45 days and left in a coma. As bad as that was, it was just the start of Aum\u2019s long list of terrifying assassinations.\n\nOthers were kidnapped and hanged on Aum property, their bodies incinerated in purpose-built microwaves. One such victim was Kiyoshi Kariya, a 68-year-old man whose brother was trying to quit the group. Kariya was kidnapped, drugged, held hostage, murdered, and then finally burned in one of Aum\u2019s incinerators. His ashes were scattered in a lake, so no trace of him would ever be found.\n\nWhen Aum\u2019s compounds were finally raided after the Tokyo subway attack, police discovered that at least eight other people had met the same hideous fate. They also discovered an assassination list. Had the cult not blown their cover with the 1995 sarin attack, the number of people incinerated in Aum\u2019s ovens would have likely been much, much higher.\n\n5 They Tortured Their Own Followers\n\nOne of Aum\u2019s central tenets was that followers had to gain enlightenment through suffering. Although that sounds like the sort of meaningless platitude that any religious sect might come out with, Aum took it very seriously. When no suffering was forthcoming, they tortured their own followers to create it.\n\nMost famously, this involved their \u201cthermotherapy\u201d ritual. Followers would be dipped in scalding hot water to purify themselves, a practice that led to burns and at least one death. When physical pain wasn\u2019t enough, the cult turned to the mental realm. Multiple initiation ceremonies involved the forced ingestion of narcotics and hallucinogens, followed by public emotional humiliation. Followers were frequently fed LSD, often without their even knowing they had taken the drug.\n\nFor those who tried to escape the cult, things were even worse. Aum operated its own prisons and torture chambers, hidden inside giant shipping containers. Suspected dissidents could face all manner of brutal interrogation methods, if they weren\u2019t simply killed outright. Yet, none of this seemed to even dent their popularity\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\n\n4 Mass Membership And Power\n\nAttack Helicopter\nFor a doomsday cult that was suspected of murder and tortured its own followers, Aum sure didn\u2019t have any problems attracting new converts. At its height in 1995, the sect had an estimated 50,000 members, most living in Russia. This significant following translated into something tangible\u2014power.\n\nAum\u2019s foothold in Russia was nothing if not terrifying. In less than half a decade, the group had managed to set up its own university in Moscow and had begun targeting disaffected students for recruitment. They even tried to set up their own company in the hopes of brainwashing the employees that would flock to them during the next... (truncated)",

California\u2019s \u201cright of publicity\u201d\n\n\nNoriega the villain in Call of Duty sure looks like the man who was dictator of Panama.\n\n\nIf you have been following Noriega\u2019s Call of Duty lawsuit, then you know that the man filed his suit in the US state of California.

Eugene Volokh, a law professor who writes for the Washington Post said that, \u201cAt the very least it sounds like Noriega has a credible claim\u201d.\n\nBut does the Noriega who appears in Call of Duty: Black Ops II look like the real Manuel Noriega? The truth is that while the Noriega that\u00a0appears in the game is a Panamanian guy in a military uniform with pockmarks on his face, the video game character is not a carbon copy of Noriega. And his likeness is used in\u00a0just a small part of\u00a0Call of Duty\u2019s campaign.\u00a0Also, the events he\u00a0takes\u00a0part in during Call of Duty\u2019s fictitious campaign\u00a0are surely different enough from those that took place during\u00a0the 1989 US invasion of Panama.\n\nSOURCE (link).

        "text":"Mistakes That Can Hurt Your Mississippi Automobile Accident Case\n\nMistakes That Can Hurt Your Mississippi Automobile Accident Case\nNovember 4, 2013 msverdict\n\nWhile no car accident victim wants to harm their own automobile accident case, there are some innocent mistakes that victims often make which can have devastating consequences on their recovery.\u00a0 The following is a list of commonly made mistakes that can harm your chances of receiving compensation for your injuries following an automobile accident:\n\n  1. Delaying seeking medical treatment\u2014this is an all too common mistake among car accident victims.\u00a0 Often, after a crash, your adrenaline is pumping and you may feel uninjured.\u00a0\u00a0 Later, when the stress and excitement of the incident fades, you realize you have actually sustained injuries.\u00a0 Your busy work or school week begins and before you know it, several days have passed and you still have not sought treatment.\u00a0 The problem becomes this\u2014the longer you wait to seek medical treatment, the easier it will be for the insurance company to make the case that your injuries did not stem from the accident.\u00a0 There are many daily activities you may partake in, such as sports, physical labor at work, and more driving, that the insurance company will use every opportunity to argue are the actual cause of your injuries.\n  2. Admitting fault\u2014you have just been in a harrowing car accident.\u00a0 You are confused, scared, and not thinking straight.\u00a0 You then strike up a conversation with the other accident victim, in which you ponder whether perhaps the accident was your fault.\u00a0 Or maybe, in your haze, you tell the police the accident was your fault.\u00a0 Later, while thinking about the incident in the calm of your home, you distinctly remember the events and realize the accident was not your fault at all.\u00a0 Unfortunately, your statements at the scene of the accident may limit or hinder your recovery.\u00a0 This is why it is so imperative to not admit fault for the accident.\n  3. Not going to your doctor\u2019s appointments or treatments\u2014everyone may need to reschedule an appointment or two, but if missing appointments becomes a pattern or if you stop going appointments or treatments, the insurance company will use this against you.\u00a0 They will argue your injuries must not be severe or legitimate if you no longer need treatment or follow-up care.\u00a0 Therefore, it is best to continue with your prescribed treatment and follow-up doctor\u2019s appointments until your physician recommends discontinuance.\n  4. Under-estimating the insurance company\u2014despite friendly sounding agents who will try to befriend you, the insurance company will look for any means to disprove or deny your claim.\u00a0 They will hire investigators that will look for evidence to hinder your recovery and they will record any statements you make concerning your injuries.\u00a0 Keep this in mind when dealing with the insurance company and, if possible, avoid all contact with them without your attorney present.\n  5. Failing to hire an aggressive, experienced Mississippi automobile accident attorney\u2014your automobile accident attorney can mean the difference between a full and complete recovery and years of catching up on unpaid medical bills.\u00a0 A zealous Mississippi automobile attorney will be there to represent your best interests.\u00a0 Automobile accidents involve complex laws of fault and compensation.\u00a0 You need the assistance of a skilled car accident attorney to provide you the best possible chance of recovery.\n\nThe Giddens Law Firm is a boutique Jackson, Mississippi personal injury law firm with more than 20 years of experience representing automobile accident victims.\u00a0 We are an aggressive team of litigators who will fight tirelessly for your recovery.\u00a0 We will also take the time you need to review your legal options and help maximize your chances of obtaining the compensation you deserve for your injuries.\u00a0 Call us today at 601-355-2022 to schedule your free and completely confidential case analysis.",

        "text":"This post is part of \"ABA TechShow 2013 Coverage,\" a series of 8 posts. You can start at the beginning or see all posts in the series.\n\nEach six-minute LexThink.1 presentation (similar to Pecha Kucha) is just long enough to get out a single idea \u2014 if the presenter is any good. The idea is to be entertaining and clever, not comprehensive.\n\nActually, LexThink.1 may be entertaining for the audience, but since most of the presenters are seasoned speakers, it\u2019s more like a dance battle. If doing polished, six-minute presentations were in any way like dancing.\n\nI think I am doing justice to the format in reducing each six-minute presentation to its one-sentence point \u2014 if it has one \u2014 plus my commentary. You can always go and watch the presentations yourself in a week or two, when Matt Homann puts them online.\n\nIn the meantime, you will have to settle for my snarky commentary.\n\nRoe Frazer: \u201cKnowing the Unknowns\u201d\n\nI think I\u2019ve got this right. Frazer\u2019s entire presentation hinged on his use of the term \u201cblack swan event,\u201d and I have no idea what he means by that. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve never seen the movie.\n\nArtificial intelligence \u2014 or Mechanical Turk or Big Data, or something, I\u2019m not sure \u2014 will eat lawyers\u2019 lunch someday.\n\nAssuming I got that right despite my ignorance of Frazer\u2019s central conceit, I guess the idea is that you should be afraid for your grandchildren\u2019s practices. Actually, ignore this. Roe Frazer is apparently an internet marketing guy. I have no idea why you would want to listen to his ideas about AI or Big Data and the law, or whatever.\n\nChad E. Burton: \u201cThe Future of Virtual Law\u201d\n\nHey, a practicing lawyer! From what I can tell from his website, Chad has actually practiced law since 2006 or 2008 or something.\n\n\u201cVirtual\u201d is just a way to deliver services that can help you serve clients who don\u2019t want to visit your office, not a replacement for, you know, actual lawyering.\n\nChad must have run into Scott Greenfield at some point. He got all defensive about being called a \u201cStarbucks lawyer.\u201d\n\nMatt Spiegel: \u201cThe Death of the Office\u201d\n\nDespite heading up MyCase, Matt is also, as far as I know, still practicing law. Which may be why his software and ideas are a little different than his competition \u2014 he tests them in his own practice.\n\nGet used to delivering legal services through technology and beat Rocket Lawyer and LegalZoom at their own game.\n\nSo, basically, do what Chad said.\n\nSarah Glassmeyer: \u201cDisruption in Publishing\u201d\n\nSarah, who is like a militant law librarian crossed with an Internet geek, or something, lost her voice and couldn\u2019t do her presentation. Follow her on Twitter, instead. She\u2019s pretty cool.\n\nBummer. I was really looking forward to Sarah\u2019s presentation.\n\nPhilip Rosenthal: \u201cFlattening the Legal Tower of Babel\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve learned that building a legal research database like Fastcase is frighteningly complicated. So I basically believe anything the big brains at Fastcase say about stuff, even if I don\u2019t understand it.\n\nIt\u2019s (long past) time to transform the legal code into a uniform system of code \u2014 for contracts, wills, and other stuff.\n\nIf it\u2019s possible, let\u2019s do it. I love this idea. Also, directly on point, check this out. Someone has already tried.\n\nJay Shepherd: \u201cDon\u2019t Do What You\u2019re Good At\u201d\n\nJay used to be a lawyer, then he wrote a cool-sounding book, Firing at Will, and he\u2019s a good speaker. (Although he\u2019s getting kind of guru-y since he closed his firm.)\n\nFind stuff you are really really good at \u2014 not just regular good at \u2014 and charge a lot of money for it.\n\n\nEric Hunter: \u201cBig Data or Big Brother\u201d\n\nEric Hunter is \u201cDirector of Knowledge, Innovation & Technology Strategies at Bradford & Barthel, LLP,\u201d which sounds too cool to be a real job.\n\n\nI have no idea what Eric was talking about. It was either too complicated, nonsensical, or he just talked too quickly. What the hell are \u201cspherical analytics?\u201d What does this have to do with Neo bending a spoon?\n\nWill Hornsby: \u201cGaming the System\u201d\n\nWill Hornsby has been staff counsel at the ABA since 1988.\n\nGamification will lead to greater access to justice.\n\nThe US sucks at access to justice. We\u2019re behind countries that don\u2019t even have stable governments. I listened to Will talk for six minutes, though, and I\u2019m not sure how gamification will solve this problem. But hey, I like video games, so I\u2019m in.\n\nMark Britton: \u201cLegalZoom is Eating Legal\u2019s Lunch\u201d\n\nLegalZoom\u2019s dominance in the entry-level legal market will lead to its broad dominance, so you have to adopt a loss-leader strategy to compete.\n\nI don\u2019t buy it. LegalZoom has been around since 2001, and hasn\u2019t gotten past the kind of forms people used to buy from OfficeMax. Using inexperienced lawyers (or non-lawyers) to prepare forms that people will buy is never going to get past the \u201centry-level legal market.\u201d\n\nNow, if LegalZoom really wants to disrupt law practice, it could hire some real, experienced lawyers at the top of their fields at market rate to build them some real forms. If that happens, we really are screwed. Although it would probably put LegalZoom out of business, in the process.\n\nAnyway, I digress. Mark thinks you\u2019re screwed already, so put your loss-leader prices out there to get potential clients in the door, then upsell them. \u201cUpsell\u201d is an unfortunate word, but good practice is giving clients what they need, not what they ask for, so maybe Mark\u2019s idea of getting people in the door with a low-priced item they are most likely to ask for is a good idea.\n\nDan Pinnington: \u201cLegal Services in a Global Village\u201d\n\nDan is a malpractice insurance guy from Canada, and he says \u201cabout\u201d exactly like you would think.\n\nThe economic model of law firms is broken, computers and non-lawyers will be our competitors in the future, and we should fight for them to be subject to the same ethical rules lawyers must follow.\n\nThis is probably right. No matter how much we try to protect the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship, not everyone wants it, and it looks like it will be watered down. Maybe ensuring everyone is subject to the same set of ethical rules is a good fallback position.\n\nMatt Homann: \u201cLet\u2019s Disrupt CLE\u201d\n\nMaybe this is less sexy than spherical analytics, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about lately, too. Lots of CLE is awful. Some of it is good. Why are so many of us forced to sit through awful CLE just to get credits?\n\nCLE should be better, and technology will not necessarily make it better, because some things are better in person \u2014 like learning. Innovate the other stuff.\n\n(Okay, that\u2019s two sentences. Matt managed to say a lot in six minutes.)\n\nWord, and good night.\n\nUpdated on April 22, 2013 with videos of the presentations.\n\nRead the next post in this series: \".\"\n\n  \u2022 This might be one of my favorite Lawyerist posts of all time\u2026.spherical analytics sounds amazing and important.\n\n    \u2022 I am just wondering which of these speakers is going to punch me for my comments first.\n\n      On my way to a bar to find out.\n\n  \u2022 I can\u2019t tell you how glad I am to read this post. Wait, maybe I can. If you\u2019re at the show this morning we\u2019ll probably run into one another. Anyway, what I probably like best about your piece is that it gives me the warm, comforting feeling that I\u2019m not the only legal tech writer who\u2019s not particularly impressed by what was said last night \u2013 and to be fair, not impressed with what has been going around the blog echo chamber for the past 10 years at least:\n\n    (a) The law is screwed;\n    (b) You\u2019re screwed;\n    (c) Legal Zoom rules the world;\n    (d) Shut up and pay for consulting.\n\n    Keep up the good work.\n\n    P.S. If you\u2019re not pissing someone off you haven\u2019t gotten your point across.\n\n  \u2022 Nice work! This is essentially what I\u2019d hoped to see at: Sadly, they haven\u2019t added a blog entry since March 27th. As for your comments, I view Mark Britton\u2019s as the most prescient. LegalZoom has plenty of moola these days. It simply won\u2019t take too much capital investment to improve the legal work and the technology to make the U.I. easy for consumers. Lawyers are fooling themselves if they think they can simultaneously ignore technology AND continue to compete. Face it folks, a lot (but not all) of what we do is intelligent cut and paste.\n\n  \u2022 DM\n\n    These videos have convinced me that there is no hope for we lawyers.\n\n    I can\u2019t decide if \u201cFuture of Virtual Law\u201d guy is a parody but I am afraid it isn\u2019t\u2026",

        "text":"25 Things you didn\u2019t know about Virginia law\n\nJust a (maybe) fun and (hopefully) helpful list of things you may not know about Virginia law. And it won\u2019t cost you a dime!\n\n  1. Virginia is a \u201cone-party recording\u201d state. This means you can secretly record conversations as long as one party to the conversation (you) knows you\u2019re recording. ON THE OTHER HAND, you cannot secretly record conversations to which you are not a party.\n\n\n  1. If you see an emergency vehicle, police office, OR TOWING VEHICLE pulled to the shoulder of the road, you must switch out of the lane nearest the vehicle if possible, and if not you must slow down.\n\n\n  1. If you fire an employee, or she leaves voluntarily, and you \u201cwillfully and maliciously prevent or attempt to prevent by word or writing, directly or indirectly,\u201d the employee \u201cfrom obtaining employment with any other person,\u201d you can be found guilty of a misdemeanor. That\u2019s right; a criminal charge! If you are asked by the prospective new employer for a reference, you can give a truthful statement \u201cconcerning the character, industry and ability\u201d of the person.\n\n\n  1. Breast-feeding mothers are allowed to breast-feed in any public place they are lawfully allowed to be. \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a woman may breast-feed her child at any location where that woman would otherwise be allowed on property that is owned, leased or controlled by the Commonwealth.\u201d Breastfeeding mothers are also exempt from Virginia\u2019s \u201cindecent exposure\u201d law. Code of Virginia \u00a7 18.2-387.\n\n\n  1. It\u2019s illegal in Virginia to kill, trap or transport wild animals, except as specifically permitted by law. If you have a problem animal (raccoon, groundhog, etc), with certain exceptions, you have to hire a licensed wildlife handler to help. What\u2019s more, transporting wild animal \u201ccarcasses\u201d is also illegal with certain exceptions (Some localities do have bounties on coyotes, and you actually get paid to shoot those). Code of Virginia \u00a7 29.1-521. One general exception: member of recognized American Indian tribes may buy and sell \u201cparts of legally obtained fur-bearing animals, nonmigratory game birds, and game animals, except bear.\u201d But, only from and to other American Indians.\n\n\n  1. Virginia is a \u201ccontributory negligence\u201d state. This means if you are even one percent negligent in a car accident, you can\u2019t recover a dime, even if the other party was 99 percent negligent. It is an extremely harsh rule that often leaves victims of personal injury without a chance for monetary recovery. (Most states are \u201ccomparative negligence\u201d states. There, if you\u2019re only one percent negligent, the other party\u2019s insurance has to pay 99 percent of your losses).\n\n\n  1. \u201cBlaze pink\u201d is now legal along with blaze orange for hunting. (2017)\n\n\n  1. School security officers can carry firearms (2017).\n\n\n  1. Most child care providers must now undergo a fingerprint-based national criminal history background check. (2017).\n\n\n  1. Driving too slow in the left land now carries a fine of $100. (2017).\n\n\n  1. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission can require an employer to provide funds for the purchase of a suitably equipped automobile for an incapacitated employee if it finds that it is medically necessary and that modifications to the employee\u2019s automobile are not technically feasible or will cost more than the funds available for a replacement automobile. The total of the costs of the automobile and of any bedside lifts, adjustable beds, and modification of the employee\u2019s principal home are limited to $42,000, which is the amount of the existing cap on expenses for modifications to the injured employee\u2019s automobile and home. (2017).\n\n\n  1. You cannot use the state seal of Virginia (think \u201cSic Semper Tyrannis\u201d) for \u201cnon-governmental purposes\u201d unless authorized by law. (Don\u2019t put the state seal on your political campaign signs).\n\n\n  1. It\u2019s illegal to smoke in a car with a child under age 8. (2016).\n\n\n  1. If you are hit with a protective order by a court, you must surrender any firearms within 24 hours. (2016)\n\n\n  1. Minimum age to marry is now 18. It used to be 16, with parental consent (2016).\n\n\n  1. Learner\u2019s permit holders may not have more than one passenger under age 21, with the exception of household or family members.

The law prohibits an employer from requiring a current or prospective employee to disclose the username and password to his social media account.\n\n\n  1. Sunday hunting is (mostly) illegal in Virginia. There are several exceptions. You can hunt waterfowl. You can hunt on your own land, or if you have written permission from the landowner. And, you can hunt raccoons until 2:00 a.m.\n\n\n  1. Under the Virginia Cave Protection Act, it is illegal to write on the walls of caves, or to transport or sell cave formations such as stalactites and stalagmites.\n\n\n  1. You cannot call a ham a \u201cSmithfield ham\u201d unless all \u201csalting, processing, treating, smoking, curing, and aging\u201d is done in the town limits of Smithfield, a town about 2 \u00bd square miles large. It\u2019s a Class 4 misdemeanor.\n\n\n  1. Any fireworks that \u201cexplode, travel laterally, rise into the air, or fire projectiles into the air\u201d are illegal in Virginia, unless you\u2019re a licensed fireworks handler.
