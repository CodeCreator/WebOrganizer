After\u00a0the birth of his son, he left Kansas State and started full-time in 1975. \u201cI wore many hats at the beginning of my career,\" Peterson said. \u201cFrom working in the feed mill to feed delivery and driving Big Wheels dry fertilizer spreaders to the office as counter sales and grain merchandiser.\"\n\nNow in mid-April, Peterson will retire from a 43-year career in the cooperative system.\u00a0\n\n\"When I started my career in the cooperative system I think the biggest reason I stayed was that I kept getting challenged to advance and in return rewarded for my hard work,\" Peterson said.\u00a0 \"I enjoyed what I did and always enjoyed working with all the people in the industry.\u00a0 It had never crossed my mind to do anything different once I was engaged in the system, learning and challenged to be able to contribute more to the company success and my own.\"\n\nIn 1980, he moved to a new elevator east of Manhattan, the current MKC Manhattan location, to manage the new facility, merchandise the company\u2019s grain, start the cooperative in liquid fertilizer and establish a custom application business. Peterson became the general manager for Farmers Cooperatives Association in 1998 and stayed in that position until coming to MKC in 2004.\n\nPeterson was the first director of operations under current President and CEO Dave Christiansen. His responsibilities were to manage one location and oversee a few facilities. Peterson said, \u201cThe few facilities soon grew to five and at one time as many as nineteen as MKC grew.\u201d\n\nOver the past 14 years, Peterson has witnessed many changes to MKC and the cooperative system as a whole. Peterson mentions watching company leadership adapt and change the vision of MKC to maintain growth, establish excellence and make employee safety a priority as a highlight. \u201cAs consolidation continues in agriculture, driving change and technology advancement ramped up. I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next, and I\u2019ll be watching,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nPeterson sees MKC as an ever-growing company, with the potential to achieve its goals. \u201cEveryone at MKC has always worked together to fulfill the mission and vision of the owners, to achieve financial success and operational excellence, to make MKC a safe place to work and to help ensure the sustainability of the cooperative system, Peterson said.\u201d\n\nFollowing retirement Peterson and his wife, Tina, plan to move back to the Wamego area. They are currently purchasing a home and ten acres in the country and intend to use it as a place for entertaining grandkids and making memories.\n\n\u201cI know I will miss the day to day interaction with coworkers and owners which I have been blessed to be able to do for 43 years working in the cooperative system,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cI feel truly blessed that I had the opportunity to work for a great company like MKC the past fourteen years.\u201d\n\nJoin us on Friday, April 27 as we honor Steve at his Retirement Party. The celebration will be hosted at the Sundstrom Conference Center in Lindsborg from 3-7 p.m. No reservation is needed. Come and go event.",

The newest step in this transition is marked by a compact online analysis system for fresh water treatment and a new flowmeter technology.\n\nComing from beginnings as a supplier of components, B\u00fcrkert Fluid Control Systems is transforming, step by step, into a designer of comprehensive systems for measuring and controlling fluids. B\u00fcrkert's claim is \"We make ideas flow\", highlighting the company's aspiration to question the existing in order to come up with new ideas and to find new, inspiring solutions to the technological challenges of today. B\u00fcrkert's engineers have learned to ask the right questions: \u201eWho\u2019s to say that there have to be sensor elements in the measuring tube of a flowmeter?\u201d Under the motto \"Inspiring Answers \", B\u00fcrkert will provide just that and, from now on, introduce products and technologies that leave the beaten tracks and give new answers to basic issues. The initiation will be given at this\nyear's Hannover Messe with the introduction of two genuine world firsts. Inspiring technologies B\u00fcrkert's new Online Analysis System Type 8905 has been designed for waterworks for the continuous monitoring of treated and untreated waters and storage of the most important measurement parameters before the water enters the supply network. With this innovative platform, B\u00fcrkert banked on uncompromising miniaturisation and modularisation. Multiple trail-blazing technologies had to be developed first, in order to make the flexibility of the new system possible. The compact design is captivating. The target group would be plant construction companies and operators of water treatment plants.\nThe other innovation is the FLOWave flowmeter. It's based on the so-called Surface Acoustic Wave technology (\"SAW\") and constitutes B\u00fcrkert's answer to the well-known weaknesses of established flowmeter technologies. FLOWave works completely without ANY components inside the pipeline and will be the technological basis for more innovations to come. FLOWave is suitable for any liquids \u2013 even non-conductive ones. What is more: the measuring principle works even at very low liquid velocities. Both systems already use the new Efficient Device Integration Platform (EDIP) that will be B\u00fcrkert's gateway to the new world of \"Industry 4.0\". EDIP comprises a multitude of functionalities, adapted HMI devices and more innovative services that will simplify the integration of new devices.\nB\u00fcrkert at Hannover Messe: hall 9, stand G16\n\nMy Comparison List",

        "text":"Jump to content\n\nThe Strength of the Co-operative Movement highlighted by the Fodder Crisis\n\nThe co-operative movement has been extremely active in responding to the difficult weather conditions facing farmers. A fodder shortage emerged along the western seaboard well before Christmas and co-ops have been to the fore in sourcing fodder for farmers in these counties. As the late spring continued, a serious fodder situation emerged nationwide. Grass growth across the country remains several weeks behind normal rates and ground conditions are in poor condition.\n\nAs the weather worsened over the Easter weekend, the decision to import fodder became inevitable. Approximately 12,000 tonnes of fodder, mainly hay and haylage have been shipped in from the UK and further afield. The enormous efforts by co-op boards, management and staff has been recognised by Minister of Agriculture, Michael Creed.\n\nIn addition to the importation of fodder, co-ops are facilitating the matching up of fodder between suppliers, co-op farm advisory teams are working intensively with farmers to identify fodder requirements and are developing appropriate feeding regimes in order to stretch fodder stocks, in some instances, co-ops have discounted ruminant feed purchases, mills have been operating on a 24\/7 basis and co-ops have applied flexible approaches towards credit.\n\nRecent media reporting directly linking dairy expansion to the current fodder crisis is unjustified. It must be recalled that a fodder crisis occurred in 2013 before the abolition of milk quotas and farms with high stocking rates comply with EU Nitrate regulations. However, ICOS believes that there are several lessons that must be acknowledged by the industry including the adoption of more risk adverse strategies such as carrying a greater fodder reserve from year to year.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture and Teagasc will also have to put into place actions to deal with the consequences of the fodder crisis. \u00a0In the immediate term, cashflow on farms is a real concern. There are also practical issues that have arisen due to the adverse weather on farms going back to as far back as last autumn, which will impact on the ability of many farmers to conserve fodder for next year.\n\nIn conclusion, ICOS would like to acknowledge the contribution made by the Department of Agriculture to the cost of importing fodder and the several actions undertaken by Minister Creed including the revised national fodder scheme and a pragmatic enforcement approach to driver\u2019s hours involved in the haulage of animal feed.\n\nBy Eamonn Farrell\n\nAgri Food Policy Executive\n\n\nTags: Fodder Crisis",

Daniel Manduku represented the Authority at the 5th\u00a0Devolution Conference held from 23rd\u00a0-27th\u00a0April, 2018 in Kakamega County.\n\nDr. Manduku and Kiambu Governor, Hon. Fredinand Waititu were among the officials on the panel during the Urban Development, Housing, Infrastructure and Energy session and contributed to the discussion on bridging the gap towards affordable housing for all, a pertinent topic in line with the government\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0Big Four development Agenda.\n\nSome of the issues tackled were the strategies that the Authority has employed and will be employing in the achievement of its mandate across the country and the programs it has initiated towards the fulfillment of same.\n\nDr. Manduku outlined the Authority\u2019s engagement of county assembly officials in three counties namely Nairobi, Nakuru and Kisii in stake holder forums, a pilot project that led to the now monthly regional sensitization stakeholder meetings, where county commissioners, county executives and other relevant players are brought together and sensitized\u00a0\u00a0on NCA\u2019s roles and functions.\n\nHe mentioned the multi-sectoral agency meetings that are also conducted monthly where government agencies come together to discuss different avenues of collaboration for better service delivery to the public.\n\n\u201cWe also conduct monthly contractor training forums covering different relevant thematic areas all over the country to build capacity among our own. We have even pegged license renewal to training attendance to ensure we reach as many people as possible,\u201d said Dr. Manduku\n\nThe registrar of contractors also discussed the one-stop-shop approach that NCA is spearheading with counsel from the Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development, its parent Ministry. In the past, the process of garnering approvals from various government agencies in different locations proved to be tedious and challenging. A pilot programme for the single window construction approval system is set to take place in Kisumu County.\n\nNCA has also recently partnered with Huduma Kenya and is currently present in fifteen Huduma centres. This was on trial basis with a goal to eventually have presence in every Huduma center country wide.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Manduku highlighted strides made in information exchange, networking and broader exposure in the Kenyan construction industry as a result of the International Construction Research Conference and Exhibition (ICORCE). ICORCE is the Authority\u2019s biennial conference hosted in partnership with other bodies that attracts more than fourteen thousand participants and high flying professionals in the construction industry both locally and internationally.",

Hogan applied his engineering degree to his job at Carrara Marble Company of America in southern California. His management helped grow the business into a powerhouse of the stone industry, now primarily involved in large scale commercial projects. Today, he is senior vice president, co-owner, and a member of the board of the directors of the company, whose works are showcases for excellence in natural stone work wherever they are located.\n\nHogan began his service on the board of directors of the Marble Institute of America in 2002 and served as its president in 2008. He made his work within MIA a priority and took on his responsibilities as president with enthusiasm and thoughtful management. As president, Hogan was greeted by perhaps the greatest crisis in the history of the modern natural stone industry\u2014the radon crisis. He rose to the occasion, working nearly full time with MIA staff to lead efforts to fight back against false claims regarding radon emission in natural stone. Long after the radon crisis, Hogan continues to contribute to the industry in countless ways, including reviewing technical papers and traveling to Washington DC for legislative visits on Capitol Hill. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn a letter nominating Hogan for this award, Scott Lardner (Rocky Mountain Stone) and Jonathan Zanger (Walker Zanger) commented: \u201cJim\u2019s leadership during a very challenging time for our industry was unwavering and his continued commitment to the industry deserves recognition. We are proud to call Jim Hogan a friend and colleague and are pleased to nominate him for the Migliore Award for Lifetime Achievement.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbout the Natural Stone Institute\n\nThe Natural Stone Institute is a trade association representing every aspect of the natural stone industry.

        "text":"News & Events\n\nMeat Producers Appreciation Day Part 2\n\n\nWhat can you do to show appreciation for our Colorado meat producers?\n\nBuy meat! Whether it is at your local grocery store or ordering a burger at a restaurant, your purchases of meat-based products is a great way to show your support for meat producers.\n\nGet to know your local producers. Farmer\u2019s markets provide a great opportunity to meet ranchers in your area as well as provide an opportunity to buy directly from the source. Farmers and ranchers each have a story and a reason why they farm or ranch, the best way to find out what those are is to ask them directly.\n\nShare your story! If you or your family has a background in raising livestock let others know. Colorado has a long history in the beef industry specifically, but as the population grows, fewer people have a direct tie to agriculture. The best person to tell our stories is us. Transparency and an open dialog can help those who don\u2019t know about or understand the industry gain a greater understanding from those who have firsthand experience.\n\nContact your local and state representatives. Legislation can have a significant impact on producers in the state, so it is important that our government officials understand the implications that different policies could have on the production of meat and food products here in Colorado.\n\nMore than Colorado. Although we are celebrating meat producers in Colorado this week. The United States is one of the top producers of agricultural products in the world. Our economy is highly dependent on the success of commodities and showing support for this industry allows for the whole country to thrive.\n\nAgRisk Advisors is proud to support meat producers and will be partnering with Lincoln Stock Growers this Friday (March 18), to provide hamburgers to those in the Centennial area. Please see our social media platforms for more information.\n\nThe following link is a great resource for individuals to find local ranchers and meat producers. You can buy your meat locally and have it shipped right to your house! Colorado Beef Check-off has provided a list of local producers so that you can easily find producers that are in your area. Link\n\nLocal Beef Directory (\n\n\nWe\u2019ll see you on Friday!\n\n\nAnd remember we are\u2026\n\nWith you\u2026no matter the weather.\n\n\nBe sure to follow our social profiles!",

According to the Commission, supplies are limited and much phosphorus is currently wasted, creating concerns about future supplies in the EU and worldwide.\u00a0\n\nThe consultation asked how to ensure that reserves are available for future generations and sought ways to minimise the undesirable side effects phosphorus use can have on the environment.\n\nCLICK\u00a0here, to read the CEMA position in full.\n\nFurther information on the European Commission\u2019s consultation is available at:\n\n\n\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nUlrich Adam \u2013 Secretary General\nTel. 0032 4 77 63 67 51\n\nBeatriz Arribas \u2013 Communications Officer\nTel. 0032 4 71 31 60 88\n\nCEMA (\u00a0is the association representing the European agricultural machinery industry. With 10 national member associations, the CEMA network represents both large multinational companies and numerous European SMEs active in this sector.\n\nCEMA represents more than 4,500 manufacturers, producing more than 450 different machine types and generating an aggregated annual turnover of more than EUR 28 billion. 135,000 people are directly employed in the sector, with a further 125,000 people working in distribution and maintenance.\n\nNewsletter Issue:",
