It is easy to share our space with those we know well, but often strangers are asked in as household help, contractors, or technicians that help us make our homes more comfortable. Acquaintances of our spouses or children also bring something new and different into our space. If we resist their presence, treating it as an intrusion, we restrict the free flow of energy and may miss the gift they bring. Instead, we can choose to treat their energy as an exchange of gifts as well as an exercise in acceptance.\n\nBefore their arrival, we can prepare by envisioning light surrounding our bodies and radiating outward from the core of our homes. We may want to create a calm and welcoming environment by playing meditation music or lighting incense. We can remove tension for all involved by putting away our valuables. Then when they arrive, we claim our boundaries by guiding them through their visit--asking them to remove their shoes, offering coasters or a place to set down tool boxes, and indicating by example to speak softly or not use harsh language. If something still causes stress, we can remember that what begins as an irritation to an oyster becomes a pearl. After they depart, we can burn sage and clear our space if we like but not without first finding the pearl.\n\nFinally, remember that we learn about life by relating with others. People may have been sent to our homes because we ignored some of the universe's messengers outside. Our homes need not be a way to keep people out but can be the place where we are ourselves while accepting and allowing other's choices. When we share the joy of our homes, we radiate our light rather than hide it behind closed doors. The more we do this, the more the outside world can become like the sanctuary we've created inside.",

        "text":"What the Second Vatican Council really said\n\nWhat the Second Vatican Council really said\n\nJohn Young\n\nThere are Catholics who see the Second Vatican Council as a disaster. The Catholic Church, they say, was flourishing until those fatal years 1962 till 1965 during which the Council was held; then the Church was suddenly in crisis, with heresies spreading like wildfire, with moral standards overturned, with vandalisation of the age-old liturgy, with disobedience bordering on anarchy.\n\nIt was not coincidence, they insist, that this upheaval occurred in the wake of the Council. It was caused largely by the Council. For the documents issued by Vatican II (they allege) contain many ambiguities and some outright errors; and these were inserted by cunning modernists among the theologians and bishops, with the intention of changing the Faith into something incompatible with Tradition but acceptable to the modern world.\n\nI would argue, on the contrary, that Vatican II was an excellent Council, and that if its directives were faithfully followed there would be a springtime for the Church such as Pope John Paul II hoped for. Its propositions are clear, with very few ambiguous statements in the whole of the sixteen documents, and it provides answers for the problems facing us now.\n\nKey points\n\nIn this article I want to look at key points in the documents which, had they been followed, would have eliminated all the big problems found in the Church today and would have rejuvenated Catholic life. I will then look at specific complaints made by those who criticise Vatican II.\n\nAt the root of the ecclesial upheavals of recent decades is the widespread defiance of the Church's authority. We are told by people who support this defiance that Vatican II abandoned an outdated, repressive, authoritarian model of the Church and gave the green light to thinking for oneself. Let's look at what the documents actually say.\n\nThe central document of Vatican II, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (Lumen Gentium), reiterates the traditional doctrine that the Pope and the bishops united with him are divinely guided when they teach the faithful. '... [t]he faithful are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent. This religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic magisterium of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra ...' (n. 25). So the Council not only required adherence to infallible teachings, but to authentic teachings which fall short of infallibility.\n\nThat same section 25 (which is a key section in the Council's documents) goes on to explain three ways in which the Church exercises her infallibility: the Pope alone, the Pope and the bishops together making a solemn pronouncement in an Ecumenical Council, and the Pope and bishops exercising their ordinary universal magisterium. That disposes of the silly idea sometimes heard that there are only a few infallible teachings. Actually there are dozens, as a glance through a standard work, Ludwig Ott's Fundamentals Of Catholic Dogma, will show.\n\nThe two pages comprising n. 25 are alone enough to destroy the nonsense about Catholics being free to do their own thing theologically, and to disagree respectfully with the magisterium after mature reflection. But those pages are not alone.\n\nOn the question of the true Church the Council is equally clear, despite the often-heard claim that it was ambiguous here. Declaring that the Church is necessary for salvation, Lumen Gentium goes on to say: 'Whosoever, therefore, knowing that the Catholic Church was made necessary by Christ, would refuse to enter or to remain in it could not be saved' (n. 14).\n\nThen, in its description of Christ's Church, the Constitution shows that the Catholic Church is meant, for it speaks of its hierarchical structure, with the Pope at its head, and of the sacraments. It explains that people outside Catholic unity are united in various ways with the Church, but it declares that 'They are fully incorporated in the society of the Church who, possessing the Spirit of Christ, accept her entire system and all the means of salvation given to her, and are united with her as part of her visible bodily structure and through her with Christ, who rules her through the Supreme Pontiff and the bishops' (n. 14).\n\n\nOne of the most upsetting things in the post-Conciliar Church is found in the way the liturgy is often celebrated. Words are added or omitted at the whim of the celebrant, in the name of creativity and relevance to the particular congregation. Too often there is a banal quality and a loss of a sense of the sacred. All this is alleged to stem from the Vatican II requirement that the liturgy be reformed.\n\nBut if we examine what the Council actually asked for, we get a different picture. Each celebration of the liturgy was declared to be 'a sacred action surpassing all others ...' (Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, n. 7). It is '... above all things the worship of the divine majesty ...' (n. 33).\n\nChanges were to be moderate and only to be made for good reasons: '[T]here must be no innovations unless the good of the Church genuinely and certainly requires them, and care must be taken that any new forms adopted should in some way grow organically from forms already existing' (n. 23). 'In liturgical celebrations each person, minister or layman, who has an office to perform, should do all of but only those parts which pertain to his office by the nature of the rite and the principles of liturgy' (n. 28).\n\nLatin was to be retained in the liturgy, while making provision for some use of the vernacular. 'Particular law remaining in force, the use of the Latin language is to be preserved in the Latin rites' (n. 36). Regarding music: 'The Church acknowledges Gregorian chant as specially suited to the Roman liturgy; therefore, other things being equal, it should be given pride of place in liturgical services' (n 116). Regarding sacred art and similar matters: 'Ordinaries must be very careful to see that sacred furnishings and works of value are not disposed of or dispersed, for they are the ornaments of the house of God' (n. 126).\n\nThe Constitution issued a key instruction which, had it been every-where obeyed, would have prevented every single one of the scandals stemming from unauthorised liturgical innovations. Having stated that regulation of the liturgy belongs solely to the authority of the Church, it continued: 'Therefore, no other person, even if he be a priest, may add, remove or change anything in the liturgy on his own authority' (n. 22).\n\n\nThe Decree on Priestly Training states that philosophy is to be taught relying on 'a philosophical patrimony which is perennially valid, and taking into account the philosophical investigations of later ages' (n. 15). As indicated in the document's footnote to Pius XII, this is the perennial philosophy of which St Thomas Aquinas is the greatest exponent. A little further on the Decree says that students for the priesthood should study theology 'under the guidance of St Thomas' (n. 16).\n\nHad these injunctions been followed the philosophy and theology in the world's seminaries would have been solid and orthodox.\n\nThe Council made it very clear that all are called to be saints (cf. the Constitution on the Church, n. 40; Decree on Ecumenism, n. 4). Regarding the laity, their baptism and confirmation give them the right and the duty to be apostles of Christ in the world (Decree on the Lay Apostolate, n. 3). They should do this by words and not just by example (n. 6). 'In addition to spiritual formation, a solid doctrinal instruction in theology, ethics and philosophy adjusted to differences in age, status and natural talents, is required' (n. 29).\n\nTake that last sentence. Suppose young Catholics at the end of the Council had set aside a couple of hours a week to study philosophy, theology and related subjects, and had continued to do this till now. What a wonderful formation they would have! Instead we find that most, including Catholics who practise their faith fervently, lack the knowledge to engage in an intelligent discussion of Catholic doctrine; while those who have done courses in the subject are often the most confused of all because of the errors they have been taught.\n\nNow for alleged errors and ambiguities. A common allegation relates to the Council's statement that the Church 'subsists in' the Catholic Church (Constitution on the Church, n. 8.) This means, so the objection goes, that the Catholic Church is only part of the Church of Christ.\n\nWere that the meaning, the document would be flatly contradicting what it said elsewhere, as quoted above. But the true sense is given in the words that follow in the same paragraph, where it is explained that 'many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside of its visible structure.'\n\nThe Catholic Church is Christ's Church in its fullness, but to the extent that elements of his Church are found outside the boundaries of the Catholic Church, his sanctification and truth are there, as well as in the visible structure of the Catholic Church.\n\nCompare the words 'subsists in' with the theological and philosophical statement that God alone is subsistent being, while all else comes from him and is dependent on him.\n\nA second objection is that Vatican II's teaching on religious freedom contradicts what the Church had taught up to that time. In fact, there is no contradiction, but there is development. The Declaration on Religious Freedom is about the function of the State in regard to religion, and it insists that people must not be compelled to act against their conscience, and must be allowed to follow their religious practices in public (even if these are sometimes erroneous).\n\nBut their rights are not unqualified. The document speaks of 'within due limits' (n. 2) and 'provided just public order is observed' (n. 3).\n\n\nA third objection claims the Cou... (truncated)",

        "text":"Ganga: The River of Rebirth\n\nChronicles known as Puranas narrate the tale of how Ganga came down to earth to help those who die take birth once more.\n\nA king called Sagara was once performing a yagna. If the ritual was a success, he would become Indra, king of paradise, and have access to all the pleasures of the world, including immortality. But there was already an Indra in the sky, and he could not bear the idea of being replaced. So he stole Sagara\u2019s horse that was an integral part of the ritual and hid it in the hermitage of a sage called Kapil. The sons of Sagara looked everywhere for the horse. They dug so deep that they created a crater that eventually became the receptacle of the sea. Finally they found the horse in Kapil\u2019s hermitage and they accused Kapil of theft. Kapil\u2019s eyes were shut at this time, as he was lost in deep contemplation. He had no idea of Indra\u2019s mischief.\n\nIrritated by the disturbance, he opened his eyes. So fiery was his first glance that the sons of Sagara who stood before him shouting accusations burst into flames and were reduced to a heap of ash. Indra smiled and Kapil shut his eyes once again. A heartbroken Sagara wondered, \u201cMy sons have been killed in their youth. I will die of old age. None of us will be Indra. The yagna had been abandoned midway. None of us will sip Amrita, the nectar of immortality. None of us will experience unending joy. Is every living creature doomed to die having lived such incomplete lives?\u201d\n\nSagara searched for an answer. So did his son Anshuman, and Anshuman\u2019s son Dilip and finally Dilip\u2019s son Bhagirath. Bhagirath met Garud, the eagle, the only creature who had defeated Indra in battle. He said, \u201cIf the ashes of your ancestors are washed by the Ganga they will be reborn and have a second chance of life.\u201d Unfortunately Ganga flowed in the sky.\n\nBhagirath prayed to Brahma, father of all living creatures, and he promised to persuade Ganga to descend on earth. \u201cBut beware,\u201d said the haughty river-goddess when compelled to descend, \u201cthe force of my fall will surely wash away all life on earth and crush its very foundations.\u201d Bhagirath therefore invoked Shiva. Shiva agreed to let Ganga fall on his head and thus protect the earth from direct impact. The world watched the spectacle of water descending from the sky. Indra gloated, convinced that Ganga would destroy all of humanity, and with that all threats to his reign.\n\nBut when Ganga fell on Shiva\u2019s head, she found his head was covered with thick matted hair, so thick and so densely matted that she found herself getting entangled and trapped. Far from washing away life and breaking the foundations of earth, Ganga found herself locked up atop Shiva\u2019s head. She tried to find a way out, but Shiva\u2019s locks were like a labyrinth. There was no escape. She begged and cried, and finally, Shiva relented and Ganga flowed out of Shiva\u2019s head, down the slopes of Kailasa, through the ravines of the Himalayas, onto the plains and finally towards the sea. Her bubbly movements irritated one sage called Jahnu who swallowed her whole but when Bhagirath revealed the identity and importance of the river, he released the river through his ear, after which she came to be known as his daughter, Jahnavi.\n\nThe idea of rebirth and the Ganga cannot be separated. The river comes from the land of Indra, who has access to Amrita, the nectar of immortality. Indra, the hero of Vedic hymns, lives the life everyone on earth wants to live. He is strong and powerful and attractive and invincible. All day he spends enjoying the good things in life. He does not fear aging or death. Kings of the earth, such as Sagara, envy him. They all want to live Indra\u2019s perfect life. They spend their lifetimes working towards it. Eventually everyone fails \u2013 those who die \u00a0young like Sagara\u2019s sons and even those who die old like Sagara himself. And everyone wonders, if there will ever be another chance to become Indra.\n\nA dip in the Ganga is about getting a karmic clean slate, a chance to begin life with a new balance sheet. Throwing ashes in the Ganga is about giving the dead a chance to be reborn once more, hopefully in Indra\u2019s paradise, and enjoy all things that were denied in this life. Ganga thus is all about forgiveness and second chances. It is an idea that gives hope to humanity.\n\nThe doctrine of rebirth is perhaps informed by agricultural practices on the riverbank, where crops grow and are harvested every year with cyclical regularity. Every year there are the rains, the summer heat and the winter chill. Nothing lasts forever, but everything comes back eventually. But civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia and China were also nurtured on the banks of rivers. Rebirth never featured in their stories. All of them spoke of death and an endless afterlife. They built pyramids and tombs to the dead and kept the ashes of ancestors in urns and temples, to celebrate the life that was. They did not cremate the dead and scatter ashes in a river, in hope of yet another life. This life was their one and only chance. In the river valley civilizations of India, however, the idea of a second chance took root firmly, perhaps because of men that the Greek followers of Alexander, the Great, identified as gymnosophists or the naked wise men, who imagined the world very differently.\n\nGanga\u2019s story refers to several such naked wise men, such as Kapil and Jahnu and Gotama and Agastya, but none more spectacular and magnificent as Shiva, from whose dreadlocks springs the promise of rebirth in the form of Ganga, and who smears his body with ash to remind all of the promise of soul that outlives death!\n\nShiva is the great destroyer whose worship scholars often fumble to explain. \u00a0How can a destroyer be worshipped? Few ponder over what Shiva actually destroys. Even today, writers on Shiva insist on describing him as \u2018destroyer of evil\u2019 or \u2018creative destroyer\u2019 which reveals this long discomfort with the term \u2018destroyer\u2019. Yes, Shiva is destroyer. He is Yamantaka, the destroyer of death, and Kamantaka, destroyer of desire. He is the destroyer of limitations imposed by one life.\n\nShiva, and the gymnosophists who considered him Adi-nath, or the primal teacher, offer a dual promise: a temporal promise to live as many lives one wants trying to be Indra, and a transcendental promise to break free from this foolhardy quest someday. This is not redemption or salvation or liberation. This is not enlightenment. This is just the offer of infinite second chances. With this one offer, death ceases to be a full stop; it becomes a comma. Shiva, the destroyer of death, then becomes worthy of worship, as does the river sprouting from his head.\n\n~ Dr. Devdutt Pattanaik\n\nAdd Comment\n\nClick here to post a comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Conv. and will be a regular column in each on-line issue. This quiet, sincere priest, with over 45 years in pastoral care and in the radio\/television ministry, will touch your heart as he pinpoints the \"how to's\" of praying with and from the heart. In his twenty-first column, his fourteenth in the Daily CATHOLIC he continues his series on Unity and how man puts too much emphasis on the mind and not enough on the heart which causes disunity and weakness for only in unity is there strength. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fr. Stephen's column along with columns by Sister Mary Lucy Astuto and Father John H. Hampsch, C.M.F. promise simple, but effective and vital insights into our faith and ways of fulfilling God's Will every day in every way. You can reach Fr. Valenta at Hearts to heart Center at P.O. Box 212, Rensselaer, New York, 12144 or you can reach him at (518) 434-1723.\n\nHow to Pray with the Heart\n\nColumn Twenty-One: Unity can only come from and with the heart!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The life of our Catholic faith is to walk in the footsteps of Jesus. If we wish to have unity in our own lives, we must be obedient to the Father as was Jesus, and being obedient to Jesus makes it possible for us to be obedient to the Father. It is in obedience that unity is found; it is in disobedience that division is found. It's as simple as that.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Personally, what does this mean for each of us? With the help of grace it is vital that each of us strive to establish unity within ourselves. There is to be an internal order of things. The mind must be subject to the heart; the heart must be subject to the Divine Will.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What does this mean to each one of us as children of the One Father? It means that as Jesus commanded, we must love our neighbor as we love ourselves, in fact, that we are to love our enemy even if our enemy does not love us.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What does this mean to each of those consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary? It means that each one must reach out to others by way of the heart. It means that if there is a wish to be effective in carrying out Our Lady's pleas, especially to help her to win her battle against satan, each of her little ones must be bonded to all others in love. Anytime the mind is allowed to divide members of her family, there is a tilt in favor of satan and our Heavenly Mother's position is weakened.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is sad that there are those of Mary's children who belittle each other, criticize each other, look down upon each other, mistrust each other, compete with each other, judge each other, snub each other, ridicule each other, hamper each other, slander each other, are hostile towards each other, treat each other with a lack of love and the litany goes on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In unity there is strength. There can be no strength if we do not live in our hearts. We know that all would go better and we would be of greater help to Mary if, as she asks of us, we would pray with the heart. We cannot however pray with the heart if we do not live IN the heart! We do not live in the heart if we do not do hearty things. If we wish to be a source of strength in Mary's cohort of little people, it must be that each of us must make a decision to be generous in doing hearty things for each other. Let's make Valentines Day every day! Not in the same manner as we're prone to celebrate such as this past weekend, but in God's Way for it is the Holy Spirit Who is the Chief Unifier! In addition to our consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, there is an additional need to enter into a consecration to the Holy Spirit. Mary, herself, extends an invitation to each of her children to lean more on her Spouse so that her Immaculate Heart may triumph sooner.\n\nIn my next installment I will begin to touch on listening to Jesus for when we do, we are listening to our heart.\n\nTo review Father Valenta's previous columns in this series, go to Archives beginning with the August 18, 1997 issue of A CALL TO PEACE: volume 8, no. 16.\n\nText Visitors to date in 1998: February 2",

The letter, known in the Catholic Church as an \"encyclical,\" is the first-ever such document devoted to the environment.\n\nThe encyclical recognizes the mainstream climate science findings that the burning of fossil fuels is causing global warming, and it marks Francis' entrance as a central player in international climate negotiations at a critical time for climate diplomacy.\n\nThe document, entitled \"Laudato Si: On Care for Our Common Home,\" is lengthy, at 180 pages.\n\nAt times, it reads like a climate science or ecology textbook, while other sections explore profound moral, ethical and religious questions about humanity's relationship with the Earth. Interestingly, it also lays out the pope's views on our technologically-obsessed society, which he calls a \"throwaway culture.\"\n\nHere are some of the major points that Pope Francis makes in his letter:\n\nThe climate is a common good\n\nFrancis aligns himself and the Catholic Church firmly behind mainstream climate science when he writes:\n\nThe climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all. At the global level, it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life. A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system.\n\nIn recent decades, this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon.\n\nIt is true that there are other factors (such as volcanic activity, variations in the earth\u2019s orbit and axis, the solar cycle), yet a number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity.\n\nA dialogue is needed between science and religion\n\nThe encyclical is unusual in that the leader of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide is weighing in on a scientific issue. It proposes a conversation between science and religion to help resolve the moral and ethical implications of climate change.\n\n\"Science and religion, with their distinctive approaches to understanding reality, can enter into an intense dialogue fruitful for both,\" the encyclical says.\n\nGod did not create Earth for us to do whatever we want with it\n\nFrancis invalidates the argument often put forward by climate skeptics and several religious groups, including some within his own church, that Earth exists for humans to exploit its resources:\n\nWe are not God. The Earth was here before us and it has been given to us. This allows us to respond to the charge that Judaeo-Christian thinking, on the basis of the Genesis account which grants man \u201cdominion\u201d over the Earth (cf. Gen 1:28), has encouraged the unbridled exploitation of nature by painting him as domineering and destructive by nature.\n\nThis is not a correct interpretation of the Bible as understood by the Church.\n\nClimate change will hit the poor hardest\n\nFrancis approaches climate change through the lens of poverty alleviation, a cause to which he has devoted his entire church career. He repeatedly refers to the chasm between how global warming will affect industrialized nations, such as the U.S. and members of the European Union, and developing nations.\n\nAccording to encyclical:\n\nClimate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. Its worst impact will probably be felt by developing countries in coming decades.\n\nAnother passage of the encyclical condemns developed countries for their unsustainable use of resources. \"The exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable limits, and we still have not solved the problem of poverty,\" the pope says.\n\nPopulation growth is not the problem\n\nThe Catholic Church has long held a controversial position against forms of birth control, and Francis doesn't deviate from that in this encyclical. He says that blaming population growth for the problems of environmental degradation and global warming is off target. Instead, \"extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some\" is more at fault.\n\n\"To blame population growth,\" Francis says, \"is an attempt to legitimize the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalized, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.\"\n\nHumanity has a duty to protect the environment, rather than exploit it\n\nIn a passage on the loss of biodiversity, Francis laments the rapid loss rate of species. \"Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their message to us. We have no such right,\" he says.\n\nGlobal climate and environmental negotiations have failed\n\nClimate Movement\n\nThousands to lobby MPs on climate.

The failure of global summits on the environment make it plain that our politics are subject to technology and finance. There are too many special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will not be affected.\n\nConsequently the most one can expect is superficial rhetoric, sporadic acts of philanthropy and perfunctory expressions of concern for the environment, whereas any genuine attempt by groups within society to introduce change is viewed as a nuisance based on romantic illusions or an obstacle to be circumvented.\n\nIn a section of the encyclical that explores the history of global environmental negotiations, Francis emphasizes that powerful countries that pollute the most, including the U.S., China, India and members of the European Union, among others, bear a special responsibility:\n\nInternational negotiations cannot make significant progress due to positions taken by countries, which place their national interests above the global common good. Those who will have to suffer the consequences of what we are trying to hide will not forget this failure of conscience and responsibility.\n\nEven as this encyclical was being prepared, the debate was intensifying. We believers cannot fail to ask God for a positive outcome to the present discussions, so that future generations will not have to suffer the effects of our ill-advised delays.\n\nIt's tempting to ignore or deny the problem \u2014 so, don't do this\n\nWhile Francis does not call out climate skeptics specifically, he does allude to the ardent foes of climate science and environmental progress when he says: \"As often occurs in periods of deep crisis, which require bold decisions, we are tempted to think that what is happening is not entirely clear.\"\n\nThe pope continues:\n\nSuch evasiveness serves as a license to carrying on with our present lifestyles and models of production and consumption. This is the way human beings contrive to feed their self-destructive vices: trying not to see them, trying not to acknowledge them, delaying the important decisions and pretending that nothing will happen.\n\nClimate change may not be solved with technology and market forces alone\n\nAn interesting section of the encyclical details the pope's views on technological development and the free market. In short, he says technological gains are often viewed without a recognition of their downsides.\n\n\"Some circles maintain that current economics and technology will solve all environmental problems, and argue, in popular and non-technical terms, that the problems of global hunger and poverty will be resolved simply by market growth,\" Francis writes. \"Their behaviour shows that for them maximizing profits is enough. Yet by itself, the market cannot guarantee integral human development and social inclusion.\"\n\nThe pope opposes the view that technological fixes will solve global warming.\n\n\"To seek only a technical remedy to each environmental problem which comes up is to separate what is in reality interconnected, and to mask the true and deepest problems of the global system,\" the encyclical says.\n\nAn obsession with technological progress is obscuring deeper ecological and ethical issues\n\nFrancis is probably not a fan of the latest gadget, as he decries a \"throwaway\" culture and obsession with technological progress above all else.\n\n\"Men and women of our postmodern world run the risk of rampant individualism, and many problems of society are connected with today's self-centered culture of instant gratification,\" he writes. The pope also appeals for solidarity with future generations, as well as current generations of the poor \"whose life ... (truncated)",

        "text":"There is only One Path\n\nIt is a common belief that there are many paths leading to self-realization that are suited to people of different temperaments. There is the path of practice, the path of self-knowledge, the path of devotion and so on. However, are these paths leading to the same place or is that wishful thinking? How can a path that is in itself incomplete lead us to spiritual completion? If we were to limit our child\u2019s development to his mind alone, neglecting his creative, physical or emotional faculties, what kind of human being would he become? It is no different in our spiritual evolution. The concept that there are many paths is just another way to justify our lack of wholeness, based on a refusal to use all the resources that we have been given towards our internal evolution.\n\nWhen we enter the spiritual path, no one is a tabula rasa; when we incarnate on the earth we carry the continuity of our previous evolution with us. As such, we tend to be attracted to a spiritual path that resonates with our past inclinations. It is natural that a seeker would choose a path that suits his proclivities; if intellect is his strength, he would have more chance of succeeding on the path of self-knowledge and so on. However, the danger is that he will remain undeveloped in other areas, areas which are essential for him to realize spiritual completion. We are multidimensional beings and all those dimensions need to be included in our evolution.\u00a0 The metaphor that there are many paths that lead to the summit of the mountain does not suitably reflect the nature of human evolution. It would be more accurate to say that different paths lead to the summits of different mountains. One may indeed be climbing a mountain, but it is not Mount Everest. There are many mountains in the inner realm; in fact most of them are more like small hills within a vast range of snowy peaks.\n\nIt is the responsibility of each seeker to aspire to become whole and to intuit, based on a sense of inner incompleteness, what is still lacking inside. On the other hand, the responsibility of a true spiritual teaching is to reflect the human journey to completion and not to offer its followers half-truths or illusions of self-realization.\n\nThe spiritual realm is like any other area of reality: it can never be fully grasped. Therefore any spiritual teaching that is aligned with the unfoldment of truth must evolve; it is impossible that any master of the past has revealed the complete truth. It is similar to science or physics: there is no final conclusion but rather a constant process of reaching higher understanding. And to grasp the nature of the ultimate reality is infinitely more complex than to find the smallest particle in the atom. In the dark ages, scientists were repressed by religious fanatics and it is those same dogmatists who hold on to past traditions as representations of the ultimate truth. These people lack the imagination to grasp the dynamic nature of spiritual enfoldment. Someone who is free enough to explore the higher horizons of truth perceives past traditions gratefully as stepping stones to higher knowledge, not as an unquestionable authority. The mind has to be free to receive true inspiration and the revelation of a new understanding.\n\nThe path of consciousness, the path of the heart or the path of being, of the source, are not necessarily different paths on the same mountain slope. In isolation from each other they are actually on different mountains separated by deep valleys. It is a common error is to think that everyone who is enlightened is in exactly the same state. In truth, they might be in very different states, so different that they have almost nothing in common. That different spiritual traditions appear to have coherent dialogues with one another is not an indication that the same state has been reached. Rather, the same conventional and imprecise terms are being used to describe very different states of realization.\u00a0Not all paths lead to the same realization. The path of consciousness leads to the realization of consciousness and only consciousness, meaning by following such a path one will not reach the absolute, which is the unmanifested source of creation, or awaken to the dimension of love. Similarly, the path of devotion cannot lead to the awakening of consciousness, and so on.\n\nThere is only one path because that path must include everything, otherwise one remains fragmented. Sometimes to reach a fragmented realization is worse than having no realization at all.\u00a0 The only way to become complete is to follow holistic evolution, as all the aspects of our internal reality are interconnected. For instance, even if through following a particular path one awakens consciousness, it is still not pure consciousness, our complete consciousness. For pure consciousness to be realized it must be actualized within the context of the whole soul. Consciousness that is disconnected from the heart and being cannot arrive at its natural state.\n\nThere is only one path to reality. There are many paths to illusion, there are many paths to nowhere, and there are many paths to an incomplete realization of reality. The most common paths are those that lead to nowhere. Some of them are very elaborated, well-respected and trusted due to their long heritage. But no one reaches anywhere and no one seems to mind. Spirituality is often a game through which one can abide upon the thought that one is on some kind of path. Reaching anything substantial is not the aim of the game; it is a game of hoping, of being a good seeker, of feeling spiritual and of giving one\u2019s power to gurus or teachings that do not deliver what they promise. There is always tomorrow or the day after \u2013 or is there?\n\nThere is only one path: the holistic path to become whole and complete. This path is not based on projecting our hope into tomorrow, or giving away our power to a guru or to grace of an unknown origin, nor is it based on doing endless practice or meditation. The one path is based on awakening to our pure nature from the very beginning and from that awakening, to unfold into other dimensions of awakening and ultimately into the complete realization. The one path is based on the actualization of our true self, our sacred individuality, within the context of surrender into the universal reality. Such a path is not based on arbitrary philosophy but is a pure reflection of the nature of human evolution.\n\nHolistic evolution must include the awakening of our complete self. An incomplete awakening is not only incomplete because is partial, but because each state of awakening needs to be linked with other states of awakening in order to become complete within itself. As we have said, a path of consciousness which stops at the awakening of consciousness does not lead to the correct realization of consciousness. In order to reach its pure nature, consciousness must be unified with the heart and the absolute and then be realized in the context of soul-awakening. On the other hand, the soul cannot be awakened if our me, the essence of our personal identity, is not awakened and then surrendered and merged into the soul. Consciousness alone is empty and incomplete and it remains powerless to transform our human self or to serve as a true platform for our transcendence.\n\nSimilarly, the heart alone means almost nothing; it is blind without consciousness. Without intelligence, which is a faculty of consciousness, the heart has no wisdom. People often speak about the wisdom of the heart, but the heart is actually very naive and confused. For its wisdom to be actualized it must be linked to the soul and there is no soul without consciousness. Consciousness gives the heart a stability and continuity of identity, a true silence upon which the heart can embrace its own presence. Paths of devotion can perhaps open the heart energetically, but are not geared towards heart-realization because that energy of devotion is outwardly oriented. In truth, for the heart to be realized it must be internalized; its I am has to be awakened in separation from any external objects of devotion. Additionally, the complete heart has to realize not only the quality of love but also of peace and stillness. These qualities cannot enter into the heart unless it is merged with the source, unless it is rooted in the depth of being. For the heart to be truly actualized it must be illuminated by consciousness and absorbed in the absolute; it must be in samadhi to become the true heart of the soul. Finally, for our heart to be complete it must be awakened and embodied as the very essence and identity of our soul.\n\nSimilarly, the realization of the absolute is rare without first having awakened consciousness. If the absolute is realised alone, one cannot enter the state deeply or render it permanent due to the lack of continuity of identity based on consciousness. Continuity of surrender requires continuity of presence and freedom from the mind, and this cannot be realized without the proper awakening of consciousness. Then, without adding the qualities of the heart to the realization of the absolute, it reflects more a negative emptiness and absence than a true, positive and fulfilling samadhi. No one really wants to enter into the cold, empty space of the cosmos and live there. Emptiness is the open space of existence that has to be filled with the light of creation in order to manifest the ultimate fulfilment. The absolute without the heart is like a dry desert without trees and flowers, without true beauty and above all \u2013 without love. Additionally, the absolute needs the heart to serve as both an energetic and existential bridge to consciousness. Consciousness cannot merge with the source without going through the heart first. In traditions which do not actively work with the heart, consciousness can never reach surrender.\n\nThere is only one path. This path can be approached from different an... (truncated)",

        "text":"Racism is an ugly reality of American society. You may debate if things are getting better or worse. But no one can honestly deny the reality of racism in society. It is simply and sadly the way the world is.\n\nRacism also rears its ugly head in the church of the Lord Jesus Christ. This should not be so. Yet, unfortunately, it is true. There is no longer the open racism of slavery or segregation. Yet the spirit of racism is evident in our inability to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep (Romans 12:15).\n\nThe good news is that ethnic harmony is possible! For this to happen, the church must be the church. And the church can only live out its Christ-given nature, calling, and mission by confidence in and submission to biblical truth. The word of God is the answer.\n\nHere are seven biblical principles that promote ethnic harmony\u2026\n\n\nGod Created all mankind in his image.\n\n\nThe Bible unapologetically teaches that God created the world, and everything in it (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 24:1-2). This includes every human being. Mankind is not the result of the random chance of an evolutionary process. God created us. Genesis 1:27 says, \u201cSo God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.\u201d God created two genders of man \u2013 male and female. But God only created one race of man. Every human being has been created in the image of God.\n\nPaul proclaimed, \u201cAnd he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, for \u201cIn him we live and move and have our being\u201d (Acts 17:26-28). No life is an accident. The nations are God\u2019s handiwork, just as much as the heavens and earth. The God who created us predetermined every detail our lives, including when and where we would live. The Lord is at work of the creation of every person and nation that we might seek him.\n\n\nEvery person is a fallen sinner.\n\n\nGod created all mankind in his image. This is an essential nature every person shares in common. But there is another essential factor we all share. Every person is a fallen sinner. Paul indicts us all: \u201cFor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\u201d (Romans 3:23). As a result of the Fall of Adam and Eve, all humankind is stained by the guilt of original sin. The blunt reality is that \u201cin Adam all die\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:22).\n\nNot only are we all stained by original sin, we are all marked by pervasive depravity. We are sinners by nature, choice, and behavior. And every aspect of our human existence is marred by our sinfulness. The pride of supposed racial superiority is folly. Every person, family, tribe, ethnicity, nation is corrupted by sin. We sin against the Lord God. We also sin against one another, in multiple ways. Racism betrays our sinfulness. As sinners, we should honor others as better than ourselves. We do the direct opposite, looking down on others, especially those \u00a0who are different than we are. But the truth is that we are guilty sinners who are doomed for eternity without the rescuing grace of God in Christ.\n\n\nRacism is sin.\n\n\nI trust this is a point that does not need to be argued. But let me state is as clearly as possible, nonetheless. Racism is a sin that grieves the heart of God the Father, dishonors the dignity of human beings made in the image of God, and injures persons, communities, and nations by harmful words, attitudes, and behavior.\n\nJesus commands, \u201cSo whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets\u201d (Matthew 7:12). In sinful pride, racism blatantly defies the Golden Rule. Likewise, Jesus instructs us to love God and love our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 22:37-39). Racism refuses to acknowledge the equality and dignity or your neighbor, much less love them as you love yourself. James wrote, \u201cMy brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory\u201d (James 2:1). James applies this exhortation to the rich who oppress the poor. But the same principle applies to matters of ethnic harmony. The sin of racism dishonors the Lord of glory.\n\n\nThe blood of Jesus has created one new race.\n\n\nThe world Jesus entered was divided between Jews and Gentiles. This was about more than Jews being the separated people of God. There was deep-seated hostility between the two races. Jesus, by the blood of his cross, not only reconciled sinners to God; he also reconciled us to one another. \u201cFor he himself is our peace,\u201d writes Paul \u201cwho has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of history\u201d (Ephesians 2:14).\n\nThe blood of Jesus Christ has created a new race of man. It is called the church. Christian baptism identifies us with this new race: \u201cFor in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body \u2013 Jews or Greeks, slaves or free \u2013 and all were made to drink of one Spirit\u201d (1 Corinthians 12:13). This does not mean Christians ignore, deny, or trivialize ethnic identity. It means our ethnic identity does not define us. \u201cFor as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ,\u201d writes Paul to the Galatians. \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\u201d (Galatians 4:27-28). Jews and Gentiles and every other ethnic group are made one by the blood of Christ.\n\n\nThe church is the hope of the world.\n\n\nAfter the flood of Noah, God commanded the people to replenish the earth and multiply. In defiance, the people began to build a tower to reach the heavens. God put an end to their rebellion by confusing their languages. This is the biblical reason for the different nationalities scattered around the world. On the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-11), the nations of the world gathered in Jerusalem heard the Spirit-filled disciples of Christ praising God in their own dialects. The church is the divine reversal of Babel. Scattered nations become a united people in Christ.\n\nRacism is a spiritual battle that can be overcome. But you cannot win spiritual battles with worldly weapons. This is why the hope of overcoming racism cannot truly be found in human effort, worldly philosophies, or even civil rights. The gospel, which reconciles God to sinners, must also reconcile sinners to one another. As a result, the church is the hope of the world. The church does not make a difference in the world as a religious institution. It does so as the body of Christ. Colossians 3:11 says, \u201cHere there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all.\u201d\n\n\nEthnic harmony in the gospel glorifies Christ.\n\n\nThe one who embraces, condones, or promotes racism does not, cannot exalt Christ. With authority over heaven and earth, Christ commissions the church to make disciples of all nations. The glorified Christ reigns over all places and all peoples. And his sovereign authority is glorified when different ethnicities follow him together in spiritual harmony. By ethnic harmony, I do not mean a so-called \u201ccolorblindness\u201d that is prone to ignore important differences and assume personal preferences. I mean spiritual \u201cone another\u201d fellowship that affirms our bond in Christ, prioritizes unity in Christ over ethnic differences, and loves one another as Christ has loved us.\n\nJohn writes, \u201cAnd they sang a new song, \u2018Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation, and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the earth\u2019\u201d (Revelation 5:9-10). Christ shed his blood to ransom the nations and make them a kingdom of priests. And Christ is glorified when his church on earth gets out its comfort zone, overcomes its prejudices, and exalts him together.\n\n\nRacism will end at the Second coming of Christ.\n\n\nIn John\u2019s Revelation, John writes, \u201cAfter this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, \u2018Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!\u2019\u201d (Revelation 7:9-10) Racism will end when the redeemed nations worship together at the throne of the Lord Jesus Christ. In the meantime, we must be realistic, hopeful, and useful.\n\nWe must be realistic. There are sad realities of this fallen world that will not change until Jesus comes again. As a result, the stain of racism will continue to mark human relationships. No government, education, economy, religion or movement will erase racism. Only the return of Christ will finally make the world as it should be. Yet we should be hopeful. All things will not be right until Jesus comes again. But things can get better. The church has a holy duty, biblical mission, and unique opportunity to effect change in the world. But each of us, who are followers of Christ, must make ourselves useful to him. We are to be the light of the world and the salt of the earth (Matthew 5:13-16). As we let the light of Christ shine in the darkness of racism, the world will see and glory the Father in heaven.",

See I am doing a new thing!\u201d Scholars have observed that we are not reformed, rehabilitated, or re-educated, but are re-created.\n\nOur ministry is to reclaim lives, recreate people, and reconcile hearts to God. To do this \u201cin Christ,\u201d we must help others experience spiritual transformation.\n\nPaul in II Corinthians (5:17) said, \u201cIf anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!\u201d\u00a0Like the caterpillar in its cocoon, man can also become newly made.\u00a0 In II Corinthians (5:14-17) Paul reminds that, \u201cFor it is the love of Christ which controls those for whom Christ died, all in order that those who live should no longer live for their own sakes but for the sake of Christ\u2026 Therefore, the result is that from now on we value no man on the world\u2019s standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe caterpillar has one essential function, and that is to feed,\u201d we learn from Natural Psychology and Human Transformation by Dr. Na\u2019im Akbar.\u00a0 The ungainly worm has no physical beauty or social graces, but rather is a greedy consumer of leaves, able to strip a vine or tree in days, directed by instinct to provide itself with nutrition conducive to its growth.\n\nTo emerge as a life re-created by God, man must consume spiritually to properly develop.\u00a0 We see the example of Saul (Paul), setting out on the Damascus road to do harm to Christians, and his miraculous conversion.\u00a0 Paul was transformed, finding at last the intimate friendship with God for which he had longed.\u00a0\u00a0 Paul was re-created.\n\nGod also needs us to reconcile hearts in Christ.\u00a0 In II Corinthians (5:18-20), Paul states \u201cAll this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men\u2019s sins against them\u2026and that \u201cWe are to be Christ ambassadors.\u201d God sends us out as butterfly ambassadors in whom Christ now lives, to extend invitations to others.\n\nThe butterfly emerges from the cocoon in the form of its beautiful parent, no longer crawling, but flying.\u00a0 It no longer eats leaves, but sips nectar from flowers.\u00a0 It flies above those who would have once trampled it.\u00a0 It is admired for its beauty.\n\nLike the butterfly, we are blessed and favored by God with divine possibilities.\u00a0 We are fed on the blood of Christ, able to survive the time required for our spiritual transformation. In time, we will emerge, endowed with the ability to re-create ourselves as God originally planned us to be \u2013 we emerge ready to be Ambassadors for Christ!\n\nWe are ready in 2010 to \u201cDo A New Thing in Christ.\u201d\n\nThe Rev.
