        "text":"At Kifco, we believe our products are the highest quality, most cost effective, and most reliable irrigation solutions available. We're confident that, no matter what the application, your investment in a Kifco Water-Reel will save you time and money. But don't just take our word for it. Hear what our customers have to say...\n\n\n\u201cWe were able to apply manure to our hay crop in early spring using Kifco, which enabled us to get into our 3rd cutting by mid-July. We could\u2019ve never done that using tankers. Next year on our corn we plan to use Kifco with a boom so we can apply right up to the property line and roadway, which will increase our yield substantially and reduce fertilizer costs. We\u2019ll also be able to apply within inches of the soil, which will greatly reduce odors.\"\n\n- John Patterson\n\n\n\u201cWe have two Kifco Water-Reels that are over 15 years old and are still in excellent working order. We use them on a regular basis to water our baseball & softball fields. About 1 \u00bd years ago we purchased the E200SST for our lacrosse and field hockey artificial field. We water this field before every game which takes less than 30 minutes! The lacrosse field has a sticky turf. Watering before the game makes the turf more forgiving with quicker movement. It makes the field safer for our players. Not only does it make the field safer for our hockey players but it also allows the ball to roll a lot smoother which the players love. These machines are a great asset to our sports fields and they stand the test of time!\u201d\n\n- Jared Rudy, Grounds Manager, Messiah College\n\n\n\u201cMy brother and I have used Kifco Ag-Rain machines on our farm and ranch properties for years, and can\u2019t say enough about how well they have performed. I use a T 23x720 to irrigate 25 acres of pastures and paddocks for my horses and livestock, and last year I bought a T 30x980 for my hay meadows. My brother Ted pumps water directly from his well to his T 27x980 machine to irrigate his pastures. The great thing about Kifco Water-Reels is that I can irrigate my hay meadows, easily move the machine a few hundred feet, and then irrigate my pastures so that my animals can graze on healthy grass and then move it back to the meadow or wherever else I need water. It\u2019s so simple. After watering my hay I can quickly and easily get them off the field when its time to cut- there are no heavy machines or pipes to move back and forth like there are with other systems. Water-Reels are also very affordable as compared to other systems because I can use it for so many fields and for a variety of purposes. On top of everything else, when consider how well these machines are made, it makes Kifco Water-Reels the natural choice for my irrigation needs. We are very satisfied Kifco customers.\u201d\n\n- Everard Droemer, Giddings, TX\n\n\nWhen I was having problems with my B140 I called upon the product support team at Kifco. The service I received was second to none. Their customer service deeply impressed me. Because of their efforts, as I buy more land and need additional irrigation, I will always turn to Kifco. They truly are the \u201cMost Trusted Name in Water-Reels.\u201d\n\n- Jim Morgan, Plainfield, WI\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Contact Us",

Your knowledgeable staff, user friendly website and quick response to my requests have exceed my expectations every time.\n\n\nLiz Estes, MEI Total Elevator Solutions\n\n\"I would say that the surveying, quoting, and overall experience has been phenomenal. KONE Spares and its team has been the most helpful during and after normal business hours and even during vacations (Mario) which is unseen in the elevator industry. The surveying process is easier now with the online form and the ordering is simple as well by using the Montgomery CTS numbers. As for the installation, I am hugely surprised how simple the installations has been.\"\n\n\n\"Any drive upgrade should take no more than 3 to 4 hours at best if all goes well but no more than 8 hours giving the elevator owner a running elevator the same day.\"\n\n\nChris Rivera, Service Manager Orlando, Oracle Elevator\n\nEscalator Parts and Elevator Parts for North America\n\n\"In 2014 we were looking into upgrading our Kone Miprom 21 elevators. I contacted Kone Spares and ask about the new DC drives that were available. I was put in contact with Mario Jones an engineer with Kone Spares who explained the benefits of installing the new DC drives. My concern was the installation of each drive, how many man hours it would take to install per elevator and if detailed instructions was provided with the purchase of the new drives.\n\n\n\"Mario assured me the drives would come with detailed instructions and the time to install would decrease after the first drive was installed. \u00a0We have 26 Kone Miprom 21 elevators at our installation and we decided to purchase 3 new drives and see how they would work. The drives were installed and working great, the instructions were detailed and the drives were easy to install. The time frame to install was cut in half after the first install. Since, we have purchased the\u00a0other 23 drives and are happy with the product.\n\n\n\"Thank you KONE Spares, and a special thanks to Kelly Oberhardt and Mario Jones for all your support during the purchasing and installation of the DC drives.\"\n\n\nDonnie Bearden, Utility Supervisor, Wolf Creek Federal Services\n\n\"I can honestly say that in my 16 years ... you and your staff are the top of my list of favorites!\u00a0 You are always so pleasant and everyone seems so knowledgeable!\"\n\n\nName and Corporation withheld by request\n(because, well ... you know)\n\nWe carry OEM parts for all major elevator and escalator brands:\n\nKONE, Montgomery, O&K, Armor, MAC, Otis, Schindler, Dover, ThyssenKrupp, and many others!\n\nWe have features and exclusives!\n\nSign up today (so you don't miss any):\n\nHear about it before anyone else \u00bb\n\nCall KONE Spares Toll Free:\n\nUSA - (800) 343-3344\n\nCanada - (888) 644-5663",
