Valley Builders works hard to satisfy every customer!\n\n  \u2022 Brian Fitchett and his crew at Valley Builders LLC were simply\u00a0wonderful to work with from the beginning to the end of our project of\u00a0building a new three bedroom house in Fort Valley. We had purchased\u00a0ready-made plans online and Brian ably customized the rooms and walls to\u00a0reflect our personal needs, in addition to bringing the house plans up\u00a0to current state and local code. He was very easy to work with and kept\u00a0us informed of the progress. All the subcontractors and suppliers, as\u00a0well as his regular crew, did an excellent job and were prompt in\u00a0correcting any of the problems that arose. The finished house is\u00a0BEAUTIFUL and we look forward to many happy hours there. We would highly\u00a0recommend Valley Builders LLC to anyone searching for a reliable and\u00a0talented contractor.\n    Jim and Vicki Cole - Manassas and Fort Valley, VA\n  \u2022 I recently contracted with Valley Builders for two pole barns, one of which was specially designed as an aviary. The crew worked hard every day and I was impressed by the quality of their work. Brian was easy to deal with and committed to meeting the schedule. I am very pleased with my new buildings.\n    Curt LeVan\n  \u2022 Dear Brian and everyone at Valley Builders, Thank you so much for the beautiful job you and your crew did for us. THe renovation of our little house is amazing! OUr master bedroom is so bright and spacious now with new windows and the increased size. The new kitchen cabinets and bar when looking through the dining area doubled the light and makes it seam so spacious. You were so pleasant to work with even when we changed a few things here and there. You all seemed to enjoy what you were doing and were excited with us as the \"new\" house began to unfold. I would recommend you and your crew to anyone who is ready to renovate an older house or build new construction. Thanks again! El and Jamie Weaver Homeowners in Fleming Park Mt. Jackson\n    El & Jamie Weaver - Mt. Jackson\n  \u2022 Recently my wife and I acquired property outside of Winchester, VA. On the property stood an old farmhouse in poor condition that we needed to remove. We contracted with Brian Fitchett of Valley Builders for the demolition project that presented several challenges: protecting existing structures, a stone lined well, and various trees and bushes. Brian and Justin did an excellent job of removing the house and restoring the site to our specifications. In spite of the bad weather the work was completed on time, and the site is clean, level and ready for grass in the spring. Valley Builders will certainly be on our bidders list when it comes time to build our home. \u00a0\n    Matt and Lynn - Alexandria, VA\n  \u2022 Brian and his team at Valley Builders built a detached garage for me. His team was hands on throughout the project and addressed every question and concern we had. Thanks again for your services. Highly recommended. \u00a0\n    Ringo Hottle, Client\n  \u2022 Everyone told my husband and myself when we started talking about building a house to prepare for unmet deadlines, long waits and huge amounts of aggravation.\u00a0 Working with Brian Fitchett, owner of Valley Builders, LLC, has been one of the best experiences we have ever had with a business.\u00a0 Brian was always accommodating, on schedule if not ahead of schedule, upfront and honest with us from beginning to end.\u00a0 He has a strong work ethic and maintained a solid trusting relationship with us.\u00a0 We were extremely happy with his work and would recommend Valley Builders, LLC time and time again. \u00a0\n    Shannon and Larry Walters, Client",

I remembered the old combines with canvas feed from the 60s and how sand and dirt would get between the canvas and the cylinder. When that happened it wouldn\u2019t turn and you would have to get out and pull the belt to get it going. But MacDon has solved all that; they\u2019ve made so many improvements that you just can\u2019t imagine how much better the FD70s are over an auger. FlexDrapers feed so evenly you don\u2019t get the big wads like you do with an auger. You can get extra time in the morning when it\u2019s really tough cutting conditions and at night when things are tough. When it moistures up you can still cut through it. I can cut at least four more hours a day with it than I can with an auger. In fact the conditions round here were so tough this year that neighbours broke augers on green beans; but we had no problem. If you\u2019re still cutting beans with an auger, you owe it to yourself to try a MacDon FlexDraper\u00ae. I have a neighbour who finally bought one after I\u2019ve been telling him that he needed one for three or four years. He couldn\u2019t imagine what the difference was until he got one and saw it with his own eyes. You basically have to see it to believe it.\n\nFind out more about FD75 FlexDraper\u00ae Headers for Combine.",

I contacted Kone Spares and ask about the new DC drives that were available. I was put in contact with Mario Jones an engineer with Kone Spares who explained the benefits of installing the new DC drives. My concern was the installation of each drive, how many man hours it would take to install per elevator and if detailed instructions was provided with the purchase of the new drives.\n\n\n\"Mario assured me the drives would come with detailed instructions and the time to install would decrease after the first drive was installed. \u00a0We have 26 Kone Miprom 21 elevators at our installation and we decided to purchase 3 new drives and see how they would work. The drives were installed and working great, the instructions were detailed and the drives were easy to install. The time frame to install was cut in half after the first install. Since, we have purchased the\u00a0other 23 drives and are happy with the product.\n\n\n\"Thank you KONE Spares, and a special thanks to Kelly Oberhardt and Mario Jones for all your support during the purchasing and installation of the DC drives.\"\n\n\nDonnie Bearden, Utility Supervisor, Wolf Creek Federal Services\n\n\"I can honestly say that in my 16 years ... you and your staff are the top of my list of favorites!\u00a0 You are always so pleasant and everyone seems so knowledgeable!\"\n\n\nName and Corporation withheld by request\n(because, well ... you know)\n\nWe carry OEM parts for all major elevator and escalator brands:\n\nKONE, Montgomery, O&K, Armor, MAC, Otis, Schindler, Dover, ThyssenKrupp, and many others!\n\nWe have features and exclusives!\n\nSign up today (so you don't miss any):\n\nHear about it before anyone else \u00bb\n\nCall KONE Spares Toll Free:\n\nUSA - (800) 343-3344\n\nCanada - (888) 644-5663",

        "text":"Holstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nTool Box Buzz rating:\n\nHolstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nTactical Tape Measure and Hammer Holders\n\nManufacturer: Holstery\nPrice: $24.99\nToolbelts are often a love-hate relationship. A high-quality belt system may offer all-day comfort but require a bulky loadbearing set-up. Holstery is a company that is helping to change that mindset. This tool review will take an in-depth look at the Holstery tactical tool holders as well as their other products.\n\nHolstery Tactical Belt Tool Holders Review\n\nWhile the toolbelt world may be lagging behind a bit in terms of innovation, the concealed carry holster industry continues to leap forward with innovations. Holstery is examining the technology of the holster world and adapting it to tools. Just look at their name. Holstery products focus on lightweight, easy on\/off, rugged, and versatile designs.\n\nHolstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nHolstery Tactical Hammer and Tape Measure Holders\n\nTwo products from the Holstery line up that immediately appealed to me were the Tactical Tape Measure Holder and the Tactical Hammer Holder. A dedicated tool belt is not something I wear daily. I spend more time in the truck or in meetings than I care to admit. Wearing a dedicated belt-mounted leather hammer loop is a recipe for back pain and a damaged truck interior.\n\nHolstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nHowever, working in construction has taught me to be as flexible and adaptable as possible. When I need a tape and a hammer on hand, I need those tools to be in place and easy to reach. Holstery gives me exactly that. Purpose-built dedicated tool holders with easy on\/off belt clips.\n\nStandout Features of the Holstery Tactical Tool Holders\n\nEasy On\/Off\n\nHolstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nThe tactical tool holders feature a body made of a rigid polymer material known as Kydex. Attached to this body is a molded plastic clip that easily mounts to your regular pants belt. The clip will accommodate up to a 1.75\u2033 belt. This width covers the thick \u201crigger\u201d style belts that are commonly available. The clip also has a hooked inside edge to grab your belt and ensures the holder only comes off if you want.\n\nComfortable Ride Height\n\nHolstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nWhen mounted on the belt, the Holstery tactical holders provide a comfortable and intuitive ride height for your tools. I found that the hammer holder sits \u201cjust right\u201d and does not dig or poke into the body. Holstery sized the steel loop\u00a0 to accommodate a range of hammers from small finish work models up to larger framers.\n\nThe tape holder does slightly offset the position of the tape. Traditionally belt-mounted holders keep the tape body in one with the belt. The Holstery off-sets it slightly lower. But it is still comfortable and effortless to remove or replace the tape. The steel clip mounted to the Holstery body offers a secure mount for the tape.\n\nHolstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nSave Your Truck Interior\n\nI mentioned back pain before from wearing a traditional hammer loop in the truck. But what grinds my gears even worse is the damage the loop does to my center console while driving. I do my best to preserve my vehicles as much as possible. Unnecessary scratches from wearing a hammer loop while driving makes my blood boil.\n\nHolstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nThe Holstery Tactical holder allows me to mount a hammer loop easily to my belt when I want one. But to remove it quickly when I don\u2019t need it. Holstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nHolstery Workshop Tool Holder Options\n\nIn addition to belt-mounted options, Holstery offers custom tool holder options for your shop or vehicle. I can mount these clips and holders\u00a0 to almost any surface. I mounted a tape measure clip and magnetic tool holder to some of the cabinets in my personal workshop. The tool magnet option is capable of holding a 28 Ounce framing hammer with ease.\n\nPrice and Availability\n\nThe tape measure and hammer holders both retail for $24.99 each at the Holstery website. In my opinion, this is a fantastic price. I have spent far more on tool accessories that aren\u2019t anywhere near as useful before. The Holstery website also features other options like a speed square holder and tool magnet. The DIY options for shop mounts are also available for about $7.00 each. To me, $25 is a small price to pay for an accessory that is as practical as the Tactical Tape Measure Holder. Mine rides in the door pocket of my truck now with a couple of tapes.\n\nHolstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nHolstery is a small American business. All of their products are designed and built in the owner\u2019s shop in Idaho. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t find their products at big box stores, yet. They are available directly from the Holstery website. Follow the Buy Now link below to purchase directly from Holstery.\n\nTactical Tape Measure and Hammer Holders\n\nOverall Impressions\n\nA dedicated tool belt is one of the best all-around options for framers, carpenters, and other related trades for managing commonly used tools. However, for many professionals, a large belt is unnecessary or unwanted. But when commonly used tools like a hammer, tape measure, or speed square are needed, a versatile and easy on\/off holder for those tools is invaluable. That is where Holstery comes in.\u00a0 Their Tactical Tool Holder\u2019s line is an outstanding accessory for anyone who finds themselves jumping onto job sites frequently, but does not require a dedicated belt system. Furthermore, they offer an intuitive and repeatable spot to store the tool when you aren\u2019t using it. Every put a full-size framing hammer in the stupid loop sewn to your pant leg? Yeah. You know what I am talking about.\n\nHolstery Tactical Tool Holders Review\n\nI found the Holstery line of accessories to be innovative and infinitely useful. The low purchase price also makes this an excellent affordable gift option for the tool users and professionals I know. My only criticism of the design is the material selection of the belt clip. A spring steel piece would allow for a thinner and more rigid profile and tuck the holder in closer to the body. Overall I am very impressed with the design. Check out\u00a0 Tactical Tool Holder\u2019s line from Holstery as a stand-alone option or as an upgrade to your current belt system.\n\nAbout the author\n\nWes Bartosik\n\nWes Bartosik is a Connecticut native with strong family ties to the construction world.

        "text":"Maasdam Pow\u2019r Pull\n\n\nBest come-along\n\nCome-alongs are a must-have for country living. They\u2019re most often used to tug vehicles out of ditches and unsuccessful stream fordings, and to tighten fencing. I\u2019ve also used mine for erecting and tightening large tents and canopies, pulling objects into and onto trucks, hoisting 350 lb carcasses for butchering, encouraging crunched automobile bodies back into proper shape, pulling stumps, straightening sagging barns back to verticality, moving large logs, turning trailers to face another direction, erecting pre-assembled 2\u00d74 wall sections built on the floor, cinching loads onto flatbed trucks, dragging heavy boats up the ramp onto the dock or onto their trailers, erecting wind generators, extracting and installing engines in vehicles and boats. In other words, moving just about anything up to 2 tons. Come-alongs should not be used to move people, since a well-used cable can snap.\n\nThe Maasdam Pow\u2019r Pull is the best (though not the cheapest) come-along you can buy. It is built better than knock-off copies \u2014 especially the $19.95 ones \u2014 in every way. There\u2019s an accessory wire gripper that enables the Maasdam (or any other pull tool) to tighten fences, clotheslines etc. I\u2019ve beat the hell out of my 1969-model, and it has never failed. It will pull 2 tons. You can buy very expensive aluminum giant come-alongs from several firms, but the fine print with them sez that they are also 2-ton, so I don\u2019t see much point in them except they are beautiful and classy-looking. Any tool that carries a high loading should be of the very best quality, as failure can be deadly or at the least scary. The Maasdam is good stuff.\n\nHints for working with a come-along: Many folks loop a come-along\u2019s cable hook around an object and then hook it back onto the cable like a noose. This is very unsafe, as the hook will either cut or seriously damage the cable. Users should invest in a couple of suitable \u201cShackles\u201d (any hardware or boat store) for such duty, and never hook anything directly to a come-along\u2019s cable. Hint for come-along use where there are no trees or objects to anchor it to: Bury your spare tire a couple feet down and hook to that. Come-alongs also need some sort of anchor for the mechanism. I keep a length of 3\/8ths chain for that purpose.\n\n08\/8\/06 -- J. Baldwin",

We are very proud that our clients take the time to express their thoughts. We want to continue to earn this type of accolade the only way we know how: performing for our clients.\n\nScience + Technology\n\nIn every project that we\u2019ve been involved in with Kraemer Brothers we\u2019ve not only seen great attention to detail and quality throughout the entire project, but also the personal commitment and involvement of the leadership down to every employee in the company. This is evident through every phase, including planning, execution and particularly during the building phase of the project.\n\n- William Linton, CEO\nPromega Corporation\n\nThere is a term used in Total Quality Management programs today called \u201cbest practices.\u201d It is evident that your organization could be used as an example of this quality principle.\n\n- Robert E. Conway, Corporate Vice President\nHazleton Laboratories\n\nThe Kraemer Brothers construction team performed beyond our expectations for this project. At every problem encountered and in the face of poor design documents, they remained helpful, willing to keep the project forward instead of hindering progress. The field crew was very knowledgeable in construction planning and execution, and the quality of work was exceptional. They managed their subcontractors well, making sure that all involved with the project remained focused on the end product. We were very lucky to have had such a conscientious construction team for this project.\n\n- Steve Kalinosky\nUSFS Forest Products Laboratory\n\nI learned early in the tenure of my position that Covance has great trust and faith in the abilities of Kraemer Brothers construction. Based on your performance at the Evansville CRU, I now understand why. Your efforts in identifying alternative construction methods during the bid evaluation period saved thousands. Your management of subcontractors has been excellent and your safety record is stellar.\n\n- Dan Quinn\nJacobs (Covance Laboratories)\n\nKraemer Brothers did an exceptional job on this project. On time and on budget, even with some difficult circumstances related to weather, etc. We are very pleased with our new facility. Kraemer Brothers assured high quality of workmanship throughout.\n\n- Dan Brethorst, Director of Facilities\nLife Technologies\n\nI want to take this opportunity to say that it has been a real pleasure to have a firm like Kraemer Brothers to rely on in such a high risk activity as construction. You have been willing on numerous occasions to go beyond the contract to help Covance in one way or another. I think\/hope we have similarly reached out since an alliance requires each to look out for the other within the framework of good business practice.\n\n- Charlotte Woods\nCovance Laboratories\n\n\nKraemer Brothers has set a new and higher standard of construction quality for the Hammons Company to judge future projects by.\n\nJohn Q. Hammons Industries\n\nThe level of cooperation and farsightedness in orchestrating the first floor project consisting of restaurants, new bar and lobby and the new swimming pool and fitness center on the third floor was unsurpassed in both orchestration and administration of.\n\n- Rodney Burwell, Chairman\nThe Madison Concourse Hotel\n\nPositive response from the community does not happen by accident, and I would like to personally commend and thank Kraemer Brothers \u2026 for running a tight ship. The Hilton Garden Inn in Wisconsin Dells and its Del-Bar companion represent a \u201cclass act\u201d in our marketplace, and it is both rewarding and consistent with our efforts to have it being constructed by another \u201cclass act\u201d \u2013 Kraemer Brothers.\n\n- Robert F. Murphy, Principal\/Project Coordinator\nSandhill Development, LLC\n\nI just wanted to take a minute to reiterate how happy all of us at the Kalahari Resort are with the terrific job that Kraemer Brothers did on the new Kalahari Indoor Theme Park. As well as being a beautiful building, it was done with great care and on time and you know how important on-time completion is to me and my company. All of my staff has told me what a pleasure it has been to work with you and your staff not only on this project, but Trappers Turn and the Ny-um-ba Kondos as well. After years of working with other general contractors, it\u2019s a pleasure to finally see how it\u2019s done right!\n\n- Todd Nelson, CEO\nKalahari Resorts\n\nIn spite of the tremendous hurdles we had to overcome to maintain the hyper track schedule, we finished each major milestone on time and within budget. From the very beginning, your ability to mobilize set a pace that pushed the Architects to their limits to keep up. Your organization's leadership, communications, and commitment to teamwork forged the success of this unprecedented construction pace.\n\n- Clarence Pettibone, President Pro Tempore\nHo-Chunk Nation\n\nThis is a unique company, because they truly represent the owner in a business manner that makes us feel that they are partners with us. The team at Kraemer Brothers is wonderful. They build a great product, because they listen and care about the customer.\n\n- Kim Schaefer, COO\nGreat Wolf Resorts, Inc.\n\nYour company and those individuals who make up your company have exhibited the highest degree of proficiency, quality and courtesy that I have had the pleasure to observe.\n\n- Daniel H. Nevaiser\nNevaiser Investments\n\nFood + Dairy\n\nKraemer Brothers kept this project on schedule and under budget while enduring some extreme winter weather conditions and complications of tying in a new building into a 50-year-old block building, 10-year-old steel building and a four-year-old freezer panel building, all with different elevations. Kraemer Brothers did a great job of handling the sub contractors\u2019 schedules and costs, keeping them informed of the constantly changing circumstances. Foremost Farms has a high standard for safety in all of our plants and for all of our projects. Kraemer Brothers made this a priority and kept the project incident free.\n\n- Merl Jones\nForemost Farms, USA\n\nI would like to thank everyone at Kraemer Brothers for a job extremely well done. You were there with us before the architect drew his first line, as you have stayed with us beyond the laying of the last brick. Your attention to detail, the craftsmanship of your people, your control of subcontractors, and your uncanny ability to stay on or ahead of even the most ambitious schedule, have made this project right-on-time, at budget, and problem-free.\n\n- Anthony R. Sana, Vice President\nSACO Foods, Inc.\n\nKraemer Bros., and, its representatives that we had the privilege to deal with in the Jerome project, are nothing short of being extremely competent and professional. We've been utilizing what you people built for us almost a year now and we couldn't be happier with the physical facility. The building itself is a showplace of how a cheese plant should be laid out and constructed.\n\n- Mark Davis\nDavisco International, Inc.\n\nHigher Education\n\nThe completed building was turned over to us on April 30, 2010, as promised by Kraemer Brothers. The $6 million project came in on budget and had a very limited number of change orders that were initiated by owner requests and a few unforeseen conditions. Kraemer Brothers delivered a very functional, quality building for us that we continue to receive compliments on. I found the Kraemer Brothers team exceptional to work with. They not only performed their own work very professionally, but they did an excellent job managing the work and performance of their subcontractors.\n\n- Daniel Motl, P.E.\nUW Physical Plant Shops & Office Building\n\nWe are delighted that the project has almost come to full completion and that Kraemer Brothers have done such an outstanding job in managing the project. Our student body is delighted with the project and have fully taken over the whole building from top to bottom and out on the terraces and green roof. Great care was taken by all the companies who worked on this project to do an excellent job of completing all the tasks associated with the building. We believe the building to be state of the art, highly sustainable in terms of energy use, and absolutely gorgeous. I can\u2019t think of a company I would rather work with than Kraemer Brothers who took such pride in making sure that the building was of very high quality.\n\n- Beth Hellwig, Davies Steering Committee Chair\nUW-Eau Claire\n\nK-12 Education\n\nThanks to you and your staff for completing the River Arts Center at the Sauk Prairie High School on time and within the cost we anticipated. Our theater is unique as it is the result of the determination of a key group of individuals in our community who are dedicated to the visual and performing arts of our students and the needs of our citizens. The dream of these individuals is now realized as your firm completed the bricks and mortar of this beautiful structure. The teamwork exhibited by your firm deserves an A+ for quality, performance and product.\n\n- Richard Maguson, former superintendent\nSauk Prairie School District\n\nI have used the words super, fantastic, exemplary, excellent and profesional when describing your services and personnel.\u00a0 I normally don\u2019t get that expressive; however, I feel that in this situation and considering what you have accomplished for our school district in the time limits you had to work with, those words are accurate.\n\n- Kent S. Nelson\nWonewoc District Administrator\n\nHaving been involved in numerous construction programs over my career, including the construction of three new high schools, I can say without reservation that your company is as fine a representative of the construction trade as I have ever encountered. ....You were and are the kind of company everyone may look to for how \u201cto do things right.\u201d The School District of Mauston has been the beneficiary of your work and your oversight.\n\n- John Kammeru...
