The 150 pitches (all fully serviced, 4\/10A electricity) are on level grass, some under trees and others in the open by a stream that runs through the site. Wild birds are abundant, including kingfishers. This is the perfect location from which to commence the climb of the Ballon d\u2019Alsace, which is hugely popular with cyclists. Theatre lovers should visit Bussang (6 km) and see the large wooden People\u2019s Theatre, built in 1895 and still performing in July and August every year; you will marvel at the raked stage and the enormous backstage areas which may be visited at any time.\n\nThe site has a special lake for children to fish (stocked by the owner), whereas the adults can visit one of three adjacent lakes just outside. The keen cyclist would enjoy the long distance track which passes the boundary. Those of a slightly different sporting bent, may like to visit the Casino at Bussang (open all year) even if only to partake of a meal and watch.\n\n\nTwo stylish and modern toilet blocks (all season) and two older ones (high season only). Facilities for disabled campers and babies. Laundry. Motorcaravan services. Gas supplies. Bar and takeaway (July\/Aug). Large heated swimming pool with slide and paddling pool (June-Aug). Fishing. Tennis. Bicycle hire. Boules. TV. Internet point.

        "text":"gather and grow\n\nHomegrown, hand-spun living in the city\n\nWe are in Delhi \u2014 acclimating, running some errands, meeting friends\u2026 and following the increasingly depressing news about the last week\u2019s devastating floods in the state of Uttarakhand, where we will be heading tomorrow.\n\ndelhi-2I\u2019ve spent years in India, and still its contradictions never cease to baffle me. There is much that I feel completely at ease with at this point, it all comes back as soon as I step off the plane \u2014 Hindi turns of phrases, how to navigate a crowd, how to cross the street without getting hit, how to avoid unwanted attention. But there are other aspects of life here that I can\u2019t walk through unfazed the way Indians seem to. Beggars with missing limbs in front of sleek boutiques, the filth surrounding a temple, an encounter with shameless rogues followed by an act of inexplicable kindness from a stranger, the way the air can be filled at once with\u00a0the most intoxicating scent of jasmine and the stench of urine.\n\nI suppose the problem is my own tendency to want to categorize things, rather than anything having to do with India itself.\n\ndelhi-3On this visit, it\u2019s the contradictions inherent in the question of sustainability in India that have made me aware of the limitations of my conceptual boxes. I grumble in my usual way about the fact that people here simply throw thrash on the street, expecting sweepers and rag-pickers to clean up the mess later. Then again, the total amount of waste in any Indian city is surely less than in your average American city. When we met with a Delhiite friend who is doing nonprofit work to advocate dry toilets that would save India\u2019s scarce resources and provide free organic fertilizer, the stories he told again challenged my notion that Indians are much more common-sense and less fussy about their waste than what I\u2019m used to. Before coming here, I had investigated the availability of organic food in Delhi \u2014 but as soon as I got here and had enjoyed the overpriced though satisfying snack at the Navdanya Cafe, I began to feel uncomfortable about the fact that my organic obsession is clearly a luxury most people here couldn\u2019t afford. I\u2019ve been happy to be able to take cycle rikshas rather than the horribly polluting auto-rikshas to get around, but am I really supporting a life-giving economy when it\u2019s another person\u2019s physical effort and even strain that\u2019s taking me where I need to go?\n\nAnd lastly, just when I had spent a morning observing the almost village-like simplicity of the food economy in the lower-income level neighborhood where we are staying \u2014 one-room dairies making their own yogurt in enormous vats, sugar-cane and lime juice pressers making fresh drinks, fruit and vegetable sellers presenting their fresh (and likely quite local) fare on their carts, small family shops throughout and no chain supermarket in sight \u2014 another friend insisted that we meet at the new Ambience mall south from Delhi, and I witnessed The Other Indian Economy. This was by far the largest mall I have ever seen: over 1 km in length, with an 867,000 square feet footprint and of course multiple levels. Inside the mall, along with over 300 brand retail stores and restaurant, were multiplex cinemas, an amusement park, skating rink etc. This is the New India that many of its inhabitants want to see. I found it disgusting in its excess. There really is no way to make a general statement about whether Indians live comparatively more sustainably than, say, North Americans. I guess I should just give up on that effort \u2014 it\u2019s a country of a billion people, after all \u2014 and start asking different questions.\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Archive for May, 2012\n\nTouring Ghana \u2013 Day 1\n\nThursday, May 31st, 2012\n\nWe had a week to kill before our reservations at Green Turtle Lodge, and no idea what to do with it. We don't really like big cities, and there is very little \u201ctourist\u201d infrastructure in Ghana, so getting around and finding places to stay wasn't easy. Inspired by Marie McCarthy's kindle book Travels in Ghana, we decided to hire a car & driver through one of the tour companies. We requested quotes from both Easy Track Ghana and Jolinaiko Eco Tours. In the end, we choose Jolinaiko largely because they had a much better price and seemed a little more flexible. Since we were returning from Benin, we wanted our tour to start in Aflao (the town at the Ghana border with Togo) and end at Green Turtle Lodge, where we already had reservations. The tour would serve the dual purposes of allowing us to see parts of Ghana we otherwise would not see, and it would allow us to get to Green Turtle Lodge without having to go back to Accra! In the end, we booked a 6-day tour, that involved visiting a Kente weaving village, an eco community, hikes to the second highest \u201cmountain\u201d and a couple of waterfalls, a palm wine brewery, a monkey sanctuary, a bead factory, the Akosombo Dam, a Lakeside lodge, and a slave castle. It was a busy 6 days.\n\nDay 1 \u2013 Aflao to Mountain Paradise\n\nWe took a car taxi from our hotel to the Ghana border. It wasn't far, but with all our gear it certainly made it easier to avoid all the border chaos on the Togo side. The actual checking out of Togo and checking into Ghana went smoothly. Just as we had arrived at a the border, we recieved a call from our driver, Fofo, saying that he had arrived in Aflao. So all we needed to do was walk away from all the touts at the border and find him. Having already arranged transportation made it much easier to get away from all the drivers offering rides to Accra.\n\nWe found it interesting that the border staff on both the Benin and Togo sides asked why we didn't speak French. In their experience everyone from Canada speaks French. We found ourselves repeating in our very broken French that only about 30% of Canadians speak French, and that most, are Anglophone. We suspect that because Benin and Togo are French speaking, it is more common for French speaking Canadians to visit here. English speaking Canadians are more likely to visit Ghana.\n\nInitially, we couldn't find the meeting place, but we were pretty obvious \u2013 two yovos standing looking at their phones \u2013 so it didn't take long for Fofo to find us. Soon, we were introduced to Fofo's beat-up 4\u00d74 Landrover (no air conditioning). We had been informed by Jolinaiko Tours that morning that the air conditioned 4\u00d74 we had been promised was broken, and that instead we would be using Fofo's Landrover for the day \u2013 with the other vehicle and driver to meet us that night.\n\nBefore leaving Aflao, we stopped at the bank machine to get some Ghana cash (Cedi). This time we used Eco Bank. At first, Becky couldn't get money, but soon discovered that it didn't work when she tried to enter a dollar amount, but worked fine when she just selected one of the values from the screen. The machine only let us take out 400 Cedi at a time (about $200). Since we had to pay the tour company in cash, and almost all our expensense would also be in cash, we each widthdrew 400 Cedi, and realized that along the way we would need to find another bank machine. In hindsight, we should have each done multiple widthdrawls (which we later discovered was possible). The Ghanian Cedi bills are thicker than the Canadian Dollar, so $200 in Cedi (mostly in 10 Cedi notes) makes for a crazy thick wad of cash!\n\nOur first tour stop for the day was at a Kente cloth weaving village. It wasn't really a village so much as a warehouse just off the main road. Becky was struck by how all the weavers were men. We paid a small fee to take pictures, and Scott took the opportunity to talk to some of the weavers. It takes them a long time to make a swath of cloth. Becky was surprised to learn that the cloth was made of a rayon-cotton blend. She expected it to be more of a traditional handmade thread.\n\nIt was 1:30 pm and we had not had lunch yet. Becky was starving. Our driver, Fofo, decided to take us to a museum before lunch. Since we paid an entrance fee for the not very impressive museum, Scott used that opportunity to ask the man there more about Kente cloth. After our quick museum visit, we headed out to a hotel restaurant for lunch. One thing to remember about restaurants in West Africa, when you order your food you can wait 60-90 minutes before you see it. Even if what you order is a \u201csimple\u201d dish. This certainly has put our local (Ottawa) Ethopian restaurants into perspective \u2013 since we are accustomed to North American restaurant time standards, we always thought the service at the Ethopian restaurant was really slow \u2013 now we realize that it was just authentic timing!\n\nAfter our late lunch, our day was not over yet. We thought we were headed towards our hotel as the day was getting on, but it turned out we were making our way to the village nearest the second highest mountain in Ghana \u2013 Mount Gemi. The drive up to the mountain village, Amedzofe, reminded us very much of a trip up to Monte Verde cloud forest in Costa Rica. The roads really needed a 4\u00d74 to traverse. There were a lot of hair-pin turns and rough patches, but as we climbed the views were spectacular. When we arrived in the town the weather was looking rather threatening, with thunder storms approaching. Rather than stop at the visitor centre, we picked up a guide and headed straight to the base of the trail. We would do the hike first, and then return to the visitor centre to register. Our 4\u00d74 made it most of the way to the top, leaving only a short 10-minute hike.\n\nThe hike and the discussion with the guide turned out to be the highlight of our day. The guide told us about his community and the neighbouring communities of the same \u201ctribe\u201d, six in total. They shared a language and were lead by the same chief. There were no trotros (mini-van buses) between the villages, and although you could see them all from the mountain top it was not easy to get from one to the other. To visit a neighbouring village you needed to hire a car and it could be over an hour drive.\n\nOur final destination for the day was the Biakpa Mountain Paradise Lodge. Unfortunately, the open air bar that overlooks the valley, which they are famous for, burned down the week before. It was a shame, as we could see the charred remains of the deck and the hillside that had burned. Fortunately, the restaurant was still operational and had a nice atmosphere. Upon arrival, we were asked to place our order for dinner. We would soon learn that this was a normal practice \u2013 ordering your meal several hours before you wanted it. After ordering and confirming how long it would take, we recessed to our room for a nice cool shower before supper. For supper Scott ordered ground nut (aka peanut) soup with chicken and fufu (ground cassava). Becky ordered stirfy vegitables with rice. When the food came, we both got ground nut soup with chicken, Becky got glutenous rice, and Scott got fufu. We would soon learn that even though something is on the menu doesn't mean they actually have it! Although this was the only place where they didn't tell us they didn't have it \u2013 they just substituted for what they had. Fortunately, the groundnut soup with chicken and rice was delicious.\n\nIt was our first stay in a \u201cbudget\u201d range hotel in Ghana, so we didn't know what to expect. It was certainly adaquate for our needs, but we were happy to be carrying our own bednet. This was the first night that we felt we actually needed it (we had used it at Marianne's but she also had netting in the windows and it wasn't really necessary there). In highsight, we would rate the hotel poorly. Compared to the other budget places we stayed in Ghana, it was expensive and not particularly clean.\n\nThe Kente clothe villiage. This particular place seemed to be the place where several different guides brought their guests \u2013 as there was another group of yovos arriving just as we left.\n\nA weaver at work.\n\nBecky climbing into the backseat of the Land Rover.\n\nA typical Ghanian school house. We found it amusing that the buildings were painted using the same colour scheme as the children's uniforms. The tan\/brown uniforms were worn by students of the government run schools.\n\nStanding atop Mount Gemi, as the weather moved in.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the cross at the top of Mount Gemi on the left side of the picture, and the rains moving in on us.\n\nThe charred remains of the bar at Mountain Paradise alongside a large terminate hill.\n\nOur hotel room with our bednet hung.\n\n\nCompared to Benin, the Internet we received from my phone was \u201chigh-speed\u201d. When the phone is acting as an Internet router, it eats the battery, so we had to plug it in while we used it.\n\n\nCrossing Togo and relaxing in Lom\u00e9\n\nWednesday, May 30th, 2012\n\nSince we were almost at the Togo border, and didn't want the inflexibility of the bus, we decided to take a taxi from Doutou to the Benin\/Togo border and then take some form of local transport (shared-taxi) across Togo to Lom\u00e9. In many ways that sounds more challenging than it actually is. Marianne arranged the first taxi for us \u2013 her usual driver picked us up and brought us right to the border. Since we'd been through the border in the other direction, we didn't find this border crossing at all challenging. We also saw the official price list for Togo Visa for Canadians and discovered that indeed we had not been ripped off. Our visas were 20,000 CFA each (a bit more than $40 CAD).\n\nFrom there, we had learned from both Logan and Marianne that after clearing customs we needed to just keep walking until we reached the area of shared taxis. We had many people offer us rides to Lom\u00e9, so getting there wasn't going ... (truncated)",
