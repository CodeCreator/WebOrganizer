At this temperature the density of water is at its greatest value and equal 1 g\/mL. Since specific gravity is a ratio, so it has no units. An object will float in water if its density is less than the density of water and sink if its density is greater that that of water. Similarly, an object with specific gravity less than 1 will float and those with a specific gravity greater than one will sink. Specific gravity values for a few common substances are: Au, 19.3; mercury, 13.6; alcohol, 0.7893; benzene, 0.8786. Note that since water has a density of 1 g\/cm3, the specific gravity is the same as the density of the material measured in g\/cm3.\n\nThe Discovery of Specific Gravity\nThe discovery of specific gravity makes for an interesting story. Sometime around 250 B.C., the Greek mathematician Archimedes was given the task of determining whether a craftsman had defrauded King Heiro II of Syracuse. The king had provided a metal smith with gold to make a crown. The king suspected that the metal smith had added less valuable silver to crown and kept some of the gold for himself. The crown weighed the same as other crowns but due to its intricate designs it was impossible to measure the exact volume of the crown so its density could be determined. The king challenged Archimedes to determine if the crown was pure gold. Archimedes had no immediate answer and pondered this question for sometime.\n\nOne day while entering a bath, he noticed that water spilled over the sides of the pool, and realized that the amount of water that spilled out was equal in volume to the space that his body occupied. He realized that a given mass of silver would occupy more space than an equivalent mass of gold. Archimedes first weighed the crown and weighed out an equal mass of pure gold. Then he placed the crown in a full container of water and the pure gold in a container of water. He found that more water spilled over the sides of the tub when the craftsman\u2019s crown was submerged. It turned out that the craftsman had been defrauding the King! Legend has it that Archimedes was so excited about his discovery that he ran naked through the streets of Sicily shouting Eureka! Eureka! (Which is Greek for \u201cI have found it!\u201d).",

As a result, geophysical data can help locate hydrocarbons, minerals, aggregate, and other natural resources. Geophysical data can also be used for geologic mapping, hydrology, environmental monitoring, slope stability assessment, infrastructure planning and monitoring, and to study permafrost.\n\nMineral Exploration\n\nGeophysical data collection in action\n\nDGGS, mineral explorers, and other organizations and individuals use geophysical data to assist in geologic mapping, determine the mineral potential of a region, and locate mineral deposits. Magnetic data can differentiate and map geologic units, locate magnetic intrusions, indicate faults, and show areas of alteration. Electromagnetic data can be used to differentiate and map geologic units, locate resistive intrusions, find conductive fault zones, and target mineral deposits. Radiometric data are useful to differentiate intrusive rocks and surficial materials. Gravity data can be used for targeting certain deposits, determine depth of fill, and improve the geologic understand of an area.\n\nHydrocarbon Exploration\n\nSeismic data can be used to map geologic structures acting as potential hydrocarbon traps and define subsurface sequence stratigraphy. In some cases, seismic attribute values and patterns may also be used as direct hydrocarbon indicators. Magnetic and gravity data are also important in determining basin geometry, locating large-scale geologic structures that provide potential hydrocarbon traps and pathways, and generating other subsurface models.\n\n\nPermafrost diagram\nElectromagnetic data can be used to map permafrost. Non-saline frozen sediments containing low amounts of free water are resistive. In contrast, thawed sediments with a high water content are conductive.\n\nEngineering Geology Applications\n\nSeismic, magnetic, electromagnetic, gravity, and ground penetrating radar data can be used for many engineering geology applications, such as infrastructure support, building materials, hydrology, and geohazard mitigation. The DGGS collection of airborne magnetic and electromagnetic data can be used to identify permafrost, faults, depth of fill, fill type, depth to water table, and changes in rock type when a resistivity or magnetic susceptibility contrast is present. Electromagnetic data is useful for identifying subsurface fresh water resources. Detailed gravity surveys can provide depth-of-fill information, which is useful for infrastructure planning and understanding hydrology. Seismic methods can be used to determine fill depth and to learn more about the mechanical properties of the subsurface materials. Ground penetrating RADAR can be useful for shallow assessments, such as determining roadbed thickness.\n\nOutreach, Education, and Citizen Science\n\nSeveral of our data products are usable without specialized software by a wide range of audiences. The data in our collection can also be used as good teaching material. For some users, we may have data collected right in your own \"backyard.\" Learn more about the data available and explore our interactive map to see what data might be in your area of interest.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 \u00b7 State of Alaska \u00b7 Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys \u00b7 Webmaster",

Feeding deer can actually harm the animals.\n\nPhoto by Lynn Chamberlain\n\nAs snow starts to fall in Utah, however, Division of Wildlife Resources biologists are issuing a plea: Don't feed the deer.\n\nIn some cases, feeding deer can actually hurt the deer a lot more than it helps them. Biologists give the following reasons why feeding deer is a bad idea:\n\n  \u2022 Deer have complex and delicate digestive systems. If you feed a deer food that its digestive system isn't ready to accept, the deer can actually die even though its stomach is full of food.\n  \u2022 Feeding deer congregates the animals in a small area. And that can lead to all kinds of problems for the deer:\n    \u2022 Congregating deer in a small area increases the chance that the deer will pass diseases to each other.\n    \u2022 When deer congregate to feed, it's \"every deer for itself.\" The larger deer push the smaller deer \u2014 the fawns \u2014 aside. Fawns often end up receiving less food than they would have received if you had left the deer alone and not fed them.\n    \u2022 Feeding deer near a road increases the chance that the deer will be hit and killed by cars.\n    \u2022 In addition to eating what you're feeding them, deer will also eat the other vegetation that's in and near the feeding area. Too many deer eating vegetation in a small area can damage the plants in the area for years to come. When deer need those plants in coming years, the plants won't be there for them to eat.\n    \u2022 Even after winter is over, deer will often stay close to the area where you fed them instead of moving to their normal summer ranges.\n\nBiologists are watching\n\nAs they do every winter, DWR biologists are monitoring deer closely. In addition to keeping any eye on the condition the deer are in, biologists are monitoring four things:\n\n  \u2022 The amount of food that's available to the deer\n  \u2022 How deep the snow is\n  \u2022 How cold the temperature is\n  \u2022 The amount of body fat they find on deer that have been killed along roads.\n\nIf three or more of the five factors reach a critical point, biologists will consider feeding deer specially designed pellets. The pellets are formulated to fit the complex digestive system mule deer have and to give them extra energy, which is something deer that are struggling to find food can really use.\n\nDWR biologists will monitor the conditions and the deer herds through the winter. If the deer need to be fed, biologists will make sure the feeding is done in the right way, at the right time and with food that is best for the deer.\n\nLearn more\n\nMore information about why deer shouldn't be fed is available online.\n\nBookmark and Share\n\nHunt drawings\nHunting permits\nFishing licenses\n\nUtah DWR video\n\nBeavers in Utah\n\nBuilding guzzlers in Utah's Newfoundland Mountains\n\nGila monsters \u2014 Creatures of legends and misconceptions\n\nSee more Utah DWR videos\n\nWildlife Newsletters\nDWR Wildlife Blog\nWildlife license plates\nTread Lightly",

In spite of their stocky body, they are a relatively small porpoise that average only 1.8 m in length for males with a maximum length of 2.29 m. Females average 1.8 m in length with a maximum length of 2.1 m. Their weight averages 123 kg for both males and females with a possible maximum weight of about 160 kg.\n\nThey have 19-23 small teeth in each side of their upper jaws and about 20-24 teeth in each side of their lower jaws, which extends beyond their upper jaw. Each spade-shaped tooth is separated by rigid, protruding growths known as \"gum teeth\" thought to be used to aid the small teeth in grasping slippery prey such as squid.\n\nThey have a hump on their dorsal (upper) side and another hump, more prominent in males, found in front of their flukes (tails) on their ventral (under) sides.\n\nTheir dorsal fins are located slightly forward of the center of their body and are triangular in shape. Their small flippers are rounded at their tips, and their small flukes are pointed with a slight notch in the middle.\n\nDall's porpoises' eyes have unique black or dark blue irises with deep, iridescent blue-green pupils.\n\nDalls porpoises\n\nThese porpoises are black on their dorsal (upper) sides with oval-shaped white markings along their flanks and white on their ventral (under) sides. Their flukes (tails) are bordered by a band of white and their dorsal fins also have white markings of various shapes, although they can be solid black or white.\n\nThere are two subspecies of Dall's porpoise, Phocoenoides dalli:\n\n  1. Dall's porpoise (dalli-phase), P. dalli dalli\n  2. Dall's or True's porpoise (truei-phase), P. dalli truei\n\nDall's porpoises are extremely fast swimmers reaching speeds of up to 30 knots. They enjoy bow riding and they create a bow wave of their own known as a \"rooster tail,\" which creates a hollow airspace in the water that allows the porpoise to continue breathing while swimming. In spite of their tendency to bow ride, this species can also be elusive when it comes to human interaction. They are typically found in groups of 10-20 individuals, but groups of up to 200 have been observed feeding. They often associate with Pacific white-sided dolphins and pilot whales.\n\nWorld Range & Habitat\n\nDall's porpoises, Phocoenoides dalli, are limited to the North Pacific, ranging from Baja California north to Alaska and the Bering Sea and across into Japanese waters. The tend to prefer colder waters with temperatures of less than 15\u00b0C. Many are year-round residents throughout their range.\n\nFeeding Behavior (Ecology)\n\nDall's porpoises, Phocoenoides dalli, feed on squid in some parts of their range, but in other areas they feed on small schooling fishes such as capelin, herring, and sardines. Deep-water species such as hake and deep-sea smelt are also prey of Dall's porpoise in some areas. In the northwest Pacific they feed primarily on lanternfish. They are known to consume about 12.7-13.6 kg of food daily, primarily at night.\n\nLife History\n\nDall's porpoises, Phocoenoides dalli, reach sexual maturity at about 1.9 m or at 8 years of age for males and about 1.7 m or 7 years for females. Calving takes place primarily in summer, although births in U.S. coastal populations occur year-round. Gestation is between 10-12 months and calves are born averaging 1 m in length and weighing about 25 kg. They are nursed for 2 years. The calving interval for females is around 3 years. Life expectancy for Dall's porpoises is estimated to be less than 20 years.\n\nConservation Status & Comments\n\nDall's porpoises, Phocoenoides dalli, are still abundant throughout their range; however in Japan, large numbers are caught in gillnet fisheries and coastal whaling operations. They are threatened by the Japanese high seas salmon fishery, where as many as 8,000-10,000 porpoises die as bycatch during the 2-month fishing season. Although Dall's porpoises do not feed on salmon, it is thought that they become entangled while feeding on deep-sea species that come to the surface at night. It has also been suggested that the plastic and nylon netting used in the salmon fisheries is not detected by Dall's porpoise sonar. Unfortunately, the majority caught are females, many of which are pregnant or nursing. Efforts are underway to protect Dall's porpoises, an important endeavor given the extent of the fishing industry in their range.\n\nReferences & Further Research\n\nACS Dall's porpoise Cetacean Fact Sheet - American Cetacean Society\nJefferson, T.A., S.

The haze stretched from Beijing southward, covering much of the coastal plain bordering Bo Hai and the Yellow Sea. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite acquired this natural-color image the same day.\n\nIn many places, the haze was thick enough to completely hide the land or water surface below. A wide band of haze extended eastward over Bo Hai. In the west, isolated mountain peaks poked above the haze, which clogged valleys between the peaks.\n\nAirborne particles are often measured in microns (also micrometers): one-millionth of a meter. Particles with diameters of 2.5 microns or smaller\u2014about one-thirtieth the width of a human hair\u2014are believed to pose the greatest health risks because they can lodge deeply in the lungs, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing measures fine particles, known as PM2.5, and reports the measurements though the BeijingAir Twitter feed. On October 20, the same day that MODIS took this picture, reported air quality ratings ranged from \u201cUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups\u201d to \u201cHazardous.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, another site, China Air Daily, provides satellite images, ground-based photos, PM2.5 readings, and other air quality readings for multiple cities in China.
