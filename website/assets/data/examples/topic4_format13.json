Daryl and his team have made a huge impact over those last three years, having assisted in progressing the careers of over 600 local professionals.\n\n\u00a0Some of Daryl most notable achievements include opening the first new Hays office since the early 2000\u2019s, as well as being recognised as the best people manager in Hays UK&I for Q3 2016 out of over 100 offices, and notably the first person in the North West to win this award. His other achievements include his work on several projects that have championed local employment and local supply chain such as Talbot gateway and several student accommodation projects at Lancaster University which have had 100% local labour from Hays.\n\n\u00a0In his 10 years working for Hays, Daryl has personally secured over 1700 placements, supporting local people to realise their passions, furthering their careers, and in turn being recognised as a trusted careers expert in the local employment market.\n\n\u00a0Commenting on his career success so far, Daryl commented, \u201cI am delighted to be celebrating my 10 years at Hays. I am as passionate as ever in placing local people in to local roles, and continuing to act as a career partner in the Lancaster and South Lakes area. I would like to thank all of our candidates, clients, and trusted partners in the area who continue to support us.

        "text":"Navigation path\n\nLeft navigation\n\nAdditional tools\n\nOther available languages: FR DE\n\nEuropean Commission\n\nPress release\n\nBrussels, 24 October 2012\n\nErasmus Mundus opens applications for scholarships for Syrian students\n\nThe European Commission announced that applications for the Erasmus Mundus scholarships for Syrian students are now open. The European Commission is keen to ensure that during the current conflict, Syrian students \u2013 including those exiled or displaced inside Syria \u2013 are able to apply to the Erasmus Mundus programme and benefit from its scholarships.\n\nThe number of Erasmus Mundus scholarships available for Syrian students has more than doubled over the last 2 years: this is the result of increased funding following last year's review of the European Neighbourhood Policy. More than 150 scholarships will be available this year.\n\nThe Erasmus Mundus programme aims to enhance the quality in higher education through scholarships and academic co-operation between Europe and the rest of the world providing both cooperation and mobility for students, academics and researchers. Since 2004, 50,000 Erasmus Mundus scholarships for students, staff and researchers have been awarded or are planned.\n\nEU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy \u0160tefan F\u00fcle said: \"It is of the utmost importance that Syrian students know that the EU will keep its door open for eligible candidates to enable them to study in European universities and promote intercultural understanding as part of the Erasmus Mundus Programme. Especially in this very difficult situation we want to reach out to Syrian students wherever they are.\"\n\nThe Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) organised the annual Erasmus Mundus Coordinators' Conference for the newly-selected partnerships of the latest Erasmus Mundus call for proposals at the end of September.\n\nOn this occasion, in a special session for the university partnerships covering Syria, the European Commission emphasised how important it is for the partnerships to guarantee that the study programme will be carried out despite the adverse situation. The EC and EACEA are making efforts to ensure maximum flexibility in programme implementation to benefit Syrian and other displaced students.\n\nIn parallel, the European Commission also launched an information campaign through the EU Delegations in countries around Syria. The campaign will involve all stakeholders who deal with displaced Syrians. In this way the EU hopes to maximise the participation of Syrian students in the Erasmus Mundus Programme.\n\nErasmus Mundus - scholarships for study, research or teaching\n\nThe European Neighbourhood Policy already reinforced its support for education in countries in the Southern Mediterranean \u2013 including Syria -with last year's review and the Communication on \"A new response to a changing Neighbourhood\". This resulted in increased funding for the Erasmus Mundus and Tempus programmes for the Neighbourhood countries for the calls for proposals for 2011, 2012 and 2013.\n\nSince the start of the programme in 2004, some 50,000 Erasmus Mundus scholarships for students, staff and researchers have been awarded or are planned under Action 1 or Action 2 for a total amount of more than \u20ac1 billion. Erasmus Mundus scholarships are designed as full-study scholarships and provide amounts to cover participation costs (including tuition fees), subsistence costs, travel and insurance. The website of each Programme or Partnership provides all the necessary information concerning the content of the course, its structure, the scholarship amounts, as well as the application and selection procedures. Entry requirements will also be listed on the programme's website \u2013 these may differ from course to course. Scholarship applications are made directly to the relevant project, using an on-line application procedure.\n\nAction 1\n\nScholarships for Erasmus Mundus Masters and PhD programmes:\n\nApplications for the next round of scholarships offered by joint programmes (Action 1) will generally need to be submitted in the last quarter of 2012: these scholarships will be for joint programmes commencing in September 2013.\n\nErasmus Mundus Masters Courses:\n\nErasmus Mundus Joint Doctorates:\n\nAction 2\n\nScholarships for academic exchange:\n\nPartnerships selected in 2011 and 2012 will be launching calls for scholarships from September 2012 onwards. Partnerships may issue a number of different calls for scholarship applications, depending on the level of study being pursued. All Action 2 partnerships are listed on the Erasmus Mundus website:\n\nFor more information\n\nWebsite of Commissioner \u0160tefan F\u00fcle:\n\nOn the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP):\n\nContacts :\n\nAnca Paduraru (+32 2 296 64 30)\n\nPeter Stano (+32 2 295 74 84)\n\nSide Bar",

The Teacher Educator of the Year award recognizes teacher educators who have demonstrated innovation in teacher education, leadership in improving CTE, and commitment to preparing teachers to deliver high-quality CTE programs. Ross has served Valley City State University for the past 24 years. Through his work as the CTE coordinator, he recognized a need and opportunity to expand the course offerings that had originally been offered as one week, intensive, on-campus workshops. Due to his work, VCSU is now delivering online courses to CTE distance students across the United States. Ross has also developed degree options that allow transferable coursework in technical specialty areas to count toward the bachelor\u2019s degree. This allows VCSU to accept technical coursework from two-year college partners in the North Dakota University System (NDUS) and across the United States.

        "text":"Weekly News Term 1|Week 11\n\nDear Parents and Caregivers,\n\nThe Arts Prefects did a great job of organising our end of term Arts Assembly which was held on Tuesday. \u00a0We had a variety of performances, from singing to a dance\u00a0performance. It was a fitting way to finish a term that has been characterised by diversity, and \u201cBe You\u201d.\n\nAs many of you will be aware Mrs Lana Morrison has resigned after nearly 7 years at St Hilda\u2019s. We will miss her commitment, enthusiasm and positivity. She has left a wonderful legacy for us as a school, working with all sports, but her contribution to tennis and netball, in particular, have been exemplary. Whether working with girls new to sport or our top athletes Lana has always cared deeply about helping our girls grow as people and as players.\u00a0 We wish her all the best for her new role with Netball South, where she will continue to help others to be the best they can be. We are currently working through the appointment process for her replacement.\n\nImage result for happy easter images\n\nThank you for all you have contributed to make this such a special and satisfying term. As a community, we continue to grow and strengthen our links and connections, which in turn benefit all of us. Wishing you all a safe and happy Easter and enjoyable holiday break.\n\nJackie Barron\n\nLockdown Procedures\n\nFollowing the events in Christchurch we feel it is important to highlight the following about Lockdown Procedures:\nWe are legally required to abide by Police regulations for any Lockdown and their protocols require all student phones to be turned off for the duration of any lockdown situation. This is one of the very first steps of the lockdown process. This is to help the Police control the situation, reduce panic, to ensure that only information confirmed as correct is passed on, and that attention is not drawn to students and staff by phones ringing or vibrating etc. Students and staff are locked down immediately into the space they are in and are unable to leave that space until cleared by the Police, so would only have access to their bags if they were already in the classroom with them.\nIf the lockdown was not internal (but was the response to something happening in the wider area such as the situation in Christchurch) the school would notify all parents that all students were safe and would follow external lockdown procedures which essentially involves keeping everyone indoors and safe rather than rigorously contained as above.\n\nMinistry of Education \u2013 Coding of Absences for Parents\n\nYou may notice some changes to the coding on your daughter\u2019s attendance record from the beginning of next term. We are required to code absences by the Ministry of Education regulations. These are as follows:\n\nExplained Unjustified (U) \u2013 These are absences which have been explained to the Absence Officer but do not fall under the Ministry of Education\u2019s justified absences.\n\nThis may include, but is not limited to:\nBoarders returning home\nAll students leaving to travel \u2013 apart from section G Overseas trips\nNon-medical appointments during school hours (eg. Driving Lessons)\nUnspecified non attendance (Daughter will not be in)\nNon school related activities (eg. Wanaka Show, external lesson \u2013 such as visiting instructor for dance, equestrian etc)\n\nHoliday During Term Time (U) \u2013 this includes holidays which overlap term time\nNew Zealand or Overseas holiday during term time (eg. holiday in Auckland, Australia, Fiji etc)\n\nLate (L) \u2013 not in class when the lesson begins\ne.g. arriving late to any class due to lack of time management\n\nMedical (J) \u2013 these are appointments for medical purposes or at home due to illness\ne.g. Doctor, Specialist, Dental, Physio appointments or short term illness\/injury\n\nNot in Class (U)\ne.g. Not in class by student choice (eg. working on an assignment for another subject, not signed out for study pass)\n\nJustified Absence (J) \u2013 these are absences which have been explained to the Absence Officer and fall under the Ministry of Education\u2019s justified absences\n\nThis may include:\nRoad Closure\nExtreme Weather\nNational, Regional or Provincial representation in a non school related sporting or cultural event\nVisiting an ill relative\nExceptional family circumstance (at the discretion of school)\n\nPresent (P)\nIn class\nOffsite school related activity\nInternal appointment\nMusic lesson\n\nPink Ribbon Breakfast\n\nThe Z Club is holding a Pink Ribbon breakfast on Friday 31 May (Term 2 \u2013 Week 4) at 7:30 am in the school Chapel.\nThe tickets can be purchased either online by filling out the form which can be accessed via the link on the St Hilda\u2019s School Facebook page or with cash at the student office in Term 2.\nStudents $10.00 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Adults $20.00\nAll funds raised will be donated to the Breast Cancer Foundation to help women who are struggling with breast cancer and to help find a cure.\nThere will be plenty of yummy food and a talk from our guest speaker Heather Cunliffe who is a researcher at the University of Otago.\nCome along and support this great cause \u2013 it is sure to be plenty of fun!\n\n\nBoard of Trustee Elections\n\nBoard of Trustee elections will be held in June this year.\u00a0 At its last meeting, the Board resolved to move to staggered elections which means that 3 of the 5 elected parent representative positions will be for the full 3 year term and 2 will be for an 18 month term.\u00a0 Nominations will be called for from 10 May 2019 for both the 3 year and 18 month terms.\u00a0 If you are interested in contributing to the governance of the school, please consider standing for election.\u00a0 More details on the role of the Board can be obtained from the School Trustees Association website\u00a0https:\/\/www.trustee-election.co.nz\/.\u00a0 Nomination forms will be available10 May 2019 and will be posted to all eligible people on the voting role.\n\nReports\/Learning Conversations\n\nAcademic Progress reports have been emailed. This report contains feedback on learning and next steps.\u00a0 It also gives you an overview of the subject.\u00a0 Specific assessment information will not be included in the report but can be accessed through KAMAR.\n\nThe Learning Conversations which will be held in Week 1 of Term 2 are a chance for you to meet with your daughter\u2019s subject teachers to discuss how the year is going and put in place plans going forward.\u00a0 This discussion is with the teacher, student and parent.\n\nThese learning conversations will take place on Monday 29th April (9:30 am \u2013 4:00 pm) and Tuesday 30th April (6:00 pm \u2013 8:00 pm)\n\nOn Monday 29th April the school will be open but we will not be running timetabled classes. Supervision will be provided for girls at school. Please email admin@shcs.school.nz if your daughter requires supervision.\n\nWe realise that it is not always possible for you to make this meeting but we encourage you to book a time for your daughter who should come by herself as this is a critical milestone in her learning for the year and she would find it very valuable to talk to teachers about her next steps.\n\nSite: \u00a0https:\/\/www.schoolinterviews.co.nz\/\nLogin:\u00a0bxyku\n\nBooking were emailed to parents on Wednesday 10th April and the site will remain open until Sunday 28th April.\n\nChapel Matters\n\nYesterday we celebrated our Easter Eucharist with Bishop Steven Benford. The Eucharist points back to the account of Jesus sharing the Passover meal with his disciples on the night before he was crucified. As they shared bread and wine together, Jesus told them that these items were like his body and blood, and that in the future, whenever they broke bread and drank the wine, they should remember him. Like the Passover lamb that was sacrificed to save the Israelites in Egypt, Jesus was going to die so that the whole world could be saved.\n\nAs we remember Jesus and his love for us at this Easter time, may we find strength and comfort in knowing that life, hope, peace, and forgiveness from God are available to us all.\n\nParental contact of students\n\nIf you need to urgently contact your daughter she will still be contactable by iMessage, email and actual phone call even if she has Family Zone installed on her phone. Snapchat, Instagram etc will not be available during school hours.\n\nStudents can also be reached by a phone call to the Student Office in the case of an emergency.\n\nVietnam Cultural Tour 2020\n\nWe are planning to take a cultural tour to Vietnam in 2020.\n\nThis trip will be very similar to the trips we have previously taken and will be open to any students who will be in Year 12 or 13 in 2020. Parents are also very welcome to join the trip.\n\nThe dates for this trip will be \u2013 7th -26th April 2020\n\nThe estimated cost for this will be $6320 (student) and $5820 (parent)\n\nWe will be holding information meetings on Sunday 28th April at 4pm and Monday 29th April at 12.30pm in the school chapel where I look forward to outlining the trip in more detail.\n\nIf you are unable to attend either meeting but you and\/or your daughter are interested in joining the trip please let me know and I will send you through the information.\n\nMy contact email is \u00a0jmaw@shcs.school.nz\n\n\nSt Hilda\u2019s had a number of girls competing at the National Surf Lifesaving IRB champs at the weekend.

        "text":"Marketing Students Get a High-Level View on NYC Trip\n\nLeBow students Taylor Menser and Chandni Shah at SAP's New York City offices\n\nThe participants in the August trip to New York City, organized by LeBow\u2019s Undergraduate Career Services, came away with new perspectives. The students, nearly all marketing majors, gained insights on potential career paths and entering the workforce, courtesy of several Drexel alumni, and they, along with the faculty and staff members who came along, saw New York City in a new way: from more than 50 stories up.\n\nThat high-level view came from a site visit to SAP, the second stop on a day that started with a jaunt through the teeming, modern workspaces at Google. Jamie Blomquist, a Class of 2009 graduate and a 2010 MBA graduate, led the students\u2019 tour through Google\u2019s largest office in New York City; the company also has offices in the Chelsea Market building, which it owns. Blomquist detailed her path to Google \u2013 completing an MBA to wait out the worst of the global recession, starting out in real estate, then working at an advertising agency \u2013 and explained her day-to-day work in Google\u2019s Sales and Consulting division.\n\nAlong the insights from Blomquist and several other current Google employees, the big draw for students was the bells and whistles of the offices. Some employees use scooters to get around the building, a former New York Port Authority building near the High Line, which encompasses a full city block. The offices are filled with kitchens, breakrooms, exercise facilities and other perks that have made Google one of the most desirable places to work for young college graduates of all backgrounds and majors.\n\nAfter departing Google, it was a short bus ride north to the Hudson Yards complex on Manhattan\u2019s West Side for a tour of SAP\u2019s Leonardo Center, including the Next-Gen Lab, an incubator space for collaborators and community partners with the company\u2019s advanced technology offerings front and center.\n\nSAP was already familiar to a number of students on the trip who had previously worked on co-op at SAP\u2019s offices in Newtown Square, and the site visit also served as a preview of another Next-Gen Lab that will open this fall as part of LeBow\u2019s Center for Business Analytics.\n\nMark Santerian, a class of 2015 graduate and a senior account manager at SAP, detailed not only his path to his current job but also the importance of building connections through networking and co-op employment. Based in Philadelphia but with clients based all over the Northeast, Santerian hopes to build even stronger ties between his company and LeBow and among Drexel alumni working there.\n\nFor Stephanie Arredondo, a junior marketing and business analytics major, the highlight of the trip was the technology on display at SAP and learning about the ways it\u2019s being used to improve customer experience. \u201cIt was great to learn firsthand the innovative technologies SAP has developed utilizing machine learning, advanced analytics, VR and more,\u201d she says.\n\nThe tour of SAP transitioned into a networking event with Drexel alumni, with the outdoor terrace on the 52nd floor becoming a popular spot for photos. Some of those shots will soon grace students\u2019 LinkedIn profiles \u2013 another step in the networking and job-search process.\n\nIn This Story\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPutting Unique Talents to Work\n\nLeBow students were tasked with aiding SAP\u2019s implementation of Autism at Work \u2014 an initiative that aims to hire more than 600 people with autism spectrum disorder by 2020.\n\nMS Econ's Alexander Smith to Intern With NYC Office of Management and Budget\n\nAlexander Smith, a student in LeBow\u2019s School of Economics MS in Econ program, has landed a policy analyst internship with the City of New York.",

The past few months have produced the harassment of eminent Tunisian intellectuals and the denunciation of various TV stations and media officials connected with the release of two movies said to degrade the sacred values of Islam. At the forefront of the political and social transformations underway throughout the Middle East and North African (MENA) region, analysts say Tunisia offers an important test case for interventions to strengthen local advocates of intellectual freedom and freedom of expression at this sensitive time.\n\nThe panel discussion will address the threat that censorship poses to Tunisian communities, specifically analyzing the nature and origin of the spreading violence that has been increasing over the past year. The discussion will be geared toward developing solutions to the current constitutional reform process in Tunisia, scheduled to conclude this fall.\n\nParticipants at the panel discussion will include: Fawzia Charfi, professor of physics, University of Tunis; Ikbal Gharbi, associate professor of anthropology, Higher Institute of Theology, Zaytuna University; Habib Kazdaghli, University Professor of Contemporary History and dean of the School of Letters, Arts, and Humanities, University of Tunis-Manouba; and Hamadi Redissi, University Professor of Political Science, School of Law and Political Sciences of Tunis, Al-Manar University.

The Center was founded as a forum for constructive debate among the various religious, intellectual, economic, and political sectors of American, European, and Islamic societies. It brings contentious issues between the Islamic world and the West into a more rational plane and promotes this approach to a wide audience, including important constituencies of policy and decision-makers, policy analysts, the media, and educational institutions.

Scholars at Risk members save lives by providing sanctuary to professors, lecturers, researchers and other intellectuals who suffer threats in their home country. Through temporary academic positions, SAR members help scholars to escape dangerous conditions and to continue their important work. In return, scholars contribute to their host campuses through teaching, research, lectures and other activities. Many scholars return to their home countries after their visit. When safe return is not possible, SAR works with scholars to identify opportunities to continue their work abroad. The benefits are clear: scholars are free to live and work without fear. SAR members gain talented academics and inspiring, courageous educators. The world benefits from solidarity among higher education institutions, greater awareness of current threats to academic freedom, and deeper appreciation of the vital role of higher education and scholarship in free societies. Scholars at Risk also educates the public about attacks on scholars and higher education communities through the SAR website, email bulletins, publications and events. The SAR Speaker Series brings threatened scholars to member campuses to engage directly with students, faculty, alumni and the community. SAR also advocates on behalf of imprisoned scholars and undertakes research aimed at promoting understanding and respect for academic freedom and related values.\n\nThis Press Release is in the following Topics:\nArts and Science, Around the Square, Events and Traditions\n\nType: Press Release\n\nNYU to Host \u201cCourage to Think: Intellectual Freedom in Tunisia and the Arab Spring\u201d\u2014April 9\n\nSearch News\n\nNYU In the News\n\nNYU Received a Record Number of Applications\n\nCapital New York reported NYU received a record 60,322 applications for the class of 2019, an increase of about 15 percent since last year.\n\nNYU Students Help City Crack Down on Hookah Bars\n\nCapital New York reported that NYU students helped New York City crack down on hookah bars that illegally include tobacco in their hookahs:\n\nRudin Center Study Says Mass Transit Helps Economic Mobility\n\nThe Wall Street Journal wrote about a report by Wagner\u2019s Rudin Center that showed that mass transit could be more important than education in determining economic mobility.\n\nBrennan Center Report Says Campaign Spending Has Jumped\n\nFrontline did a piece about a report by the Brennan Center for Justice that said that campaign spending by outside groups has more than doubled in the last five years.\n\nNYU\u2019s Dorms Ranked Among the Best in the Nation ranked NYU\u2019s student residences third in the country in its list of best college dorms.\n\n\nNYU Footer",
