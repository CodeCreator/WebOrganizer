        "text":"Get information that is essential for all newcomers to Canada\n\nViewed 4456 Times 0 Comments\n\nYour foreign driver\u2019s licence may be valid for only three to six months after you arrive in Canada. So it is wise to get an international driver\u2019s license before you leave your home country. Regardless, you will eventually need to take a driving test to obtain a Canadian driver\u2019s licence.\n\nLicences are issued by the province or territory in which you live. In order to receive a licence, you must pass several tests: a vision test, a written examination and a road test. In some provinces, a minimum of 30 days is required between writing the knowledge test and taking a road test.\n\nI drove in my homeland for 24 years and yet I still flunked the knowledge test and barely passed the road test here, so I\u2019d recommend studying for your test and taking some driving lessons again. It will make the process easier.\n\nAlso, you must be at least 16 years old before you can be tested for a driver\u2019s licence in Canada. Some provinces have a graduated licensing system whereby young drivers can be restricted to driving only in daylight hours during their probation period.\n\nWhen applying for a driver\u2019s licence, the following documents may be necessary for proof of name, signature and address: \u00a6A passport \u00a6A Permanent Resident (PR) Card \u00a6Proof of address (bank statement or other public office received mail) \u00a6A driver\u2019s licence from your home country, but an international driver\u2019s licence is best\n\nIncidentally, a driver\u2019s licence is one of the best pieces of identification you can have, since it shows your photograph, signature and address.\n\nWas this answer helpful ?

They discuss motorcycles and motorcycling,\nbeverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops, helmets, anti-fog\nshields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve seats, bird hits,\ndeer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, traffic laws, tickets,\ncorrosion control, personalities, puns, double entendres, culture, absence of\nculture, first rides and friendship.  They argue with each other and plan\nrides together.\n\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that,\nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each\nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world\nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\n\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers; the\npeople range from college and university students to high-tech industry\nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it's the file name for\nthe group's primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per\nmonth; it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent posters\nbelong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred to as the\n\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of parodies\ndesigned to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer enthusiast\nBruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen of Doom.\" A\nwhile later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD number 0003 Keeper of the Flame.\nBruce was then designated DoD number 0002, retroactively and, of course,\nNickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD number 0001.\n\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules\nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD number 0011 -- became Keeper of the\nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been\nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and Canada,\nas well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Norway\nand Finland.\n\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run of\n300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the American\nMotorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- selling Denizens\nof Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a few months later.\nAgain, the project was successful and the profits were donated to the\nfoundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 to the AMA\nmuseum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs in the\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum.   [ see below for current donation total ]\n\nAs often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go\nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of DoD'ers\nare centered near Denver\/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's \"Silicon\nValley.\" Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on Rollins Pass\nin Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \"Joust.\"\n\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big barbecue\ndinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern California\nride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, meeting at a\npredesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan for 1991 is to\nhold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction with the AMA\nheritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\n\nThough it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective\ncommunications hub,, will not replace the more traditional\nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in\nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to get\ntogether.  Long may they flame.\n\n\t\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\t[centerbar]\n\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which you\ncan gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do anything\nlike that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\"; issuing them is\ncalled \"flaming.\" Flames often start when a member disagrees with something\nanother member has posted over the network.  A typical, sophisticated,\nintelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be something like:  \"What an\nincredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad poseur!\" This will guarantee\nthat five other people will reply in defense of the original poster,\ndescribing just what they think of you, your riding ability and your cat.\n\n\n              _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\n\n                     by John Sloan  DoD #0011\n\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised.  This is one of those\nquestions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there is a God, why\nis there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do women inevitably tell\nyou that you're such a nice guy just before they dump you?\", the kinds of\nquestions steeped in mysticism, tradition, and philosophy, questions that have\ninspired research and discussion by philosop...

        "text":"\n\nWho can ride the bus?\n\nAnyone! Arrowhead Transit is public transportation in Northeastern Minnesota. Our services can accommodate many transportation needs including getting to and from work, appointments and shopping. Our goal is to reduce the transportation barriers to find and retain employment, independent living, and simply getting you to where you need to go.\n\nHow far in advance do I need to schedule my ride?\n\nWe ask that you call at least an hour in advance of when you need your ride. If you choose, you can set up a ride up to one month in advance; or you can set up a regular schedule of pick-ups. But, if you do set up a ride in advance, or you set up a regular schedule, make very sure you call dispatch if you do not need a ride on any particular day.\n\nHow should I wait for the bus?\n\nBest: Be outside your door so your bus driver can see you when the bus arrives. Acceptable: Be at your window watching for your bus so you can be outside within 60 seconds of the arrival of your bus.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nClick on the county and the city where you need a ride. There you will find a schedule of where and when\u00a0are buses go, and the cost of each ride. For transportation within the cities of Virginia & Grand Rapids, the cost is $1.75\/ride; International Falls, $1.50\/ride; Cloquet, Pine City, Grand Marais and Two Harbors, $1.25\/ride.\u00a0The cost of transportation between towns within a county does not exceed $4\/ride.\u00a0If the price of a ticket is a barrier, please look into our Rural Rides program.\n\nDo you make provision for people who have limited mobility?\n\nYes. All our buses have a wheel chair lift and space for tying down either 3 or 5 wheelchairs. If you use a walker, you can either use the lift to get onto the bus, or our driver can assist you getting up the steps. Unlike big city buses, our drivers are instructed to give assistance to anyone who may need it. That includes help with carrying packages on and off the bus.\n\nDo kids pay full fare?\n\nNo. Children five and younger are free; children 6-12 are half fare with a paying adult. (Multiple children can get half fares with one paying adult.)\n\nAre there built in seat restraints for small children so I don\u2019t have to bring a car seat?\n\nYes. The front two seats have built in child restraints. Our driver will help you buckle in your child.\n\nCan I get a Frequent Rider Discount?\n\nAll our Dial-A-Rides have unlimited monthly bus passes. Seniors 90 and over can request an Free Pass forever by contacting marketing coordinator Larry Rodgers: 218-735-6815; larry.rodgers@aeoa.org; 702 3rd Ave S; Virginia, MN 55792. Disabled vets also ride free by showing the driver their Veteran\u2019s card showing they are disabled.\n\nCan I bring a bike on the bus?\n\nYes, but let dispatch know you will be bringing your bike onto the bus\n\nIs there room for luggage?\n\n\nCan I eat my lunch on the bus?\n\nNo. Eating or drinking on the bus is not permitted.\n\nHow do I know I will be safe on the bus?\n\nOur bus drivers are\u00a0instructed to be very proactive regarding any type of disturbance. All our buses have 7 security cameras.\n\nAm I allowed to tip my driver?\n\nNo. But compliments are always appreciated.\u00a0Do let us know if you have received particularly good service from your driver. Contact\u00a0public relations coordinator Larry Rodgers:\u00a0218-735-6815; larry.rodgers@aeoa.org\n\nIf I have a complaint, who do I contact?\n\nCall or email public relations coordinator Larry Rodgers:\u00a0218-735-6815; larry.rodgers@aeoa.org",

        "text":"Often asked: If You Pull Off The Road How Far Should Your Car Be Seen?\n\nHow many feet should your car be visible?\n\n\u2014 All vehicles, including animal-drawn vehicles, must have at least one white light visible from a distance of not less than 1,000 feet to the front.\n\nHow far should you be able to see down the road when you drive?\n\nProper Scanning: A general rule of thumb is to scan ahead 12-15 seconds in all environments, 1-11\u20442 blocks in city environments and 1\u20444 mile in highway environments. Blind spots and mirrors should be checked every 3-5 seconds before and after changing lanes.\n\nHow many car lengths is 3 seconds?\n\nHow to Measure a Safe Following Distance. Many drivers follow the \u201cthree-second rule.\u201d In other words, you should keep three seconds worth of space between your car and the car in front of you in order to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nYou might be interested:\u00a0 Question: What Ro Do In Road Rage Somebody Runs Up To Car?\n\nHow far should you be able to see on the road in seconds?\n\nCalculating this rule is fairly simple. Basically, you should always allow three full seconds between yourself and the vehicle in front of you. You can do this by using a specific point ahead such as a sign that you see on the side of the road, and then count \u201cone-thousand-one, one-thousand- two, one-thousand-three.\u201d\n\nHow many car lengths is a safe distance?\n\nThe rule of thumb is to maintain at least a three-second following distance, giving you time to react and avoid potentially dangerous situations. You can calculate this by using a fixed object, such as a pole or an overpass to determine how far in front of you the car is.\n\nHow many car lengths do you have to be behind a car?\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal. Figure one car length for every ten miles an hour,\u201d Barndt said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re doing 55 miles an hour you should have six car lengths between you so that if something happens to the car in front of you, you have time to stop or react.\u201d\n\nWhere should you look when driving?\n\nAim High in Steering Look well ahead when driving your vehicle. Steer the vehicle using your lower fringe vision. Look in the direction you want the vehicle to go, especially in bends and corners.\n\nHow far ahead do you need to see before passing a car?\n\nIn order to avoid last minute moves, you should look down the road 10 to 15 seconds ahead of your vehicle. A driver needs to look that far ahead to see hazards early. Constantly staring at the road just in front of your car is dangerous.\n\nYou might be interested:\u00a0 What Is The Net Force Acting On A Car Cruising At A Constant Velocity Of 70 Km\/h On An Uphill Road?\n\nWhere should you look when you slow down?\n\nIt is very important to look for vehi \u2013 cles to the rear prior to changing lanes, slowing down, entering traffic from the side of a street or driv- ing down a long or steep hill. The faster your vehicle is going, the more time and distance it will take for turning, slowing or stopping.\n\nWhat is the 3 second rule of driving?\n\nTo avoid this, use the \u201cthree-second rule.\u201d When the vehicle ahead of you passes a certain point, such as a sign, count \u201cone-thousand-one, one-thousand-two, one-thousand-three. \u201d This takes about three seconds. If you pass the same point before you finish counting, you are following too closely.\n\nWhat is the 3 to 6 second rule?\n\nDouble and Triple the 3-Second Rule The 3-second rule only applies to good, daylight driving conditions. If you are driving in heavy traffic, driving at night, or in weather conditions that are not ideal, such as rain or fog, consider doubling the 3-second rule to six seconds as a safety precaution.\n\nWhat is the 4 second rule while driving?\n\nOnce the vehicle ahead of you passes the object, slowly count to four: \u201cOne one-thousand, two one-thousand \u2026\u201d If you reach the object before you\u2019re done counting, you\u2019re following too closely. It\u2019s a handy rule \u2014 however, it only holds true in good weather.\n\nHow many feet should you stay behind a car when it\u2019s raining?\n\nIf it\u2019s raining and you are driving at night, you should aim to be 6 seconds behind the vehicle in front of you. If possible \u2014 and in heavy traffic, it might not always be \u2014 try to keep from being boxed in by cars in the lanes on either side of you, Van Tassel says.\n\nYou might be interested:\u00a0 FAQ: Why Would A Car Be Sitting On The Side Of The Road Running Next To My House?\n\nWhen should you apply the 4 second rule?\n\nThe 4-second rule is used when it would take you longer to stop than usual. To check you\u2019re travelling 4 seconds behind the vehicle in front, follow the same steps as the 2-second rule but count \u2018one thousand and one, one thousand and two, one thousand and three, one thousand and four\u2019 instead.\n\nWhat is the best rule for following distance?\n\nThe Three-Second Rule Increasing the distance between you and the car ahead can help give you the time you need to recognize a hazard and respond safely. The National Safety Council recommends a minimum three-second following distance. Determining the three-second gap is relatively easy.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"What warranty will you get on used car parts?\n\nThere are various reasons for not trusting used car products but there are very few reasons to trust the used car products and about the seller. One of the very few reasons is the warranty. Warranty is the assurity to the customers that, if they face some issue after purchasing the used product. Then there will be someone for sure to listen to their problems. But what warranty will you get on used car parts? Let\u2019s know.\u00a0\n\nThere are few different aspects that affect what warranty you will get and for how long the warranty will last.\n\n\nFactors Affecting The Warranty For Any Product\n\n\nSeller You\u2019re Choosing\n\nMost often you will notice that some sellers are just rude and hide lots of beneficial offers from them only just to get that benefit for themselves. This is not a proper ethic of doing business. That is why it is very important for you to know complete things about the seller before purchasing any product from him. Or if the seller is known to you for a very long time then this is the best thing.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Age Of That Product\n\nIt\u2019s very important for you to know the age of that used car part, as it happens that many car parts that have been used for very long, their warranty period time is very short. And the same happens when you choose the new and very less used engine, you will get a much longer warranty time-period.\u00a0\n\n\nBrand And Model Of The Product\n\nNot much but there are some brands of car parts manufacturing that offer much longer warranty periods for their products. One reason for this is that they are confident about the build quality of their products. They know that there won\u2019t be any manufacturing defects in their product within a short time period. The second reason is that they are well known reputed brand names, and they tend to keep their status as big as always. Therefore they offer various unusual and unique things from other car manufacturing companies.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the minimum warranty time period?\n\nIf we tell you that, in olden times, there was only 30-days warranty time period for used car products, and surprisingly it was sufficient at that time! Because there was very little competition in the market. But now as the competition in the market is very high, the seller\u2019s are now even offering the warranty period of two-years. But the standard warranty time-period as for now is 90- days, which is 3 months.\u00a0\n\nHere we are offering 1 year, 2 year, 5 year and even life-time warranties and labor coverage.\u00a0\n\nSome sellers might include the labor coverage in the warranty as well but not many do. Hence beware when you\u2019re visiting any seller, know what\u00a0 they have to offer before accepting the product deal.",

        "text":"Donate Your Car - Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are the benefits of donating my car to Arts for LA?\u00a0\n\nArts for LA benefits by receiving a cash donation to fund new and existing programs and increase community awareness through local events.\n\nYou benefit by being able to reduce your taxable income when taxes are itemized. Plus you avoid the costs associated with selling your car. No need to pay for advertising, no loss of privacy and possible security risk, and no need to pay for vehicle registration, insurance, and repairs to keep your car in running condition while you wait for a buyer.\n\nDoes my car have to be running to donate it?\n\nIn most cases we can take your car, running or not. However, it must have an engine and be tow-able. Contact a representative at 1-800-500-RIDE (7433)\u00a0to find out if your vehicle qualifies for pick-up.\n\nDo you only accept cars for donation?\u00a0\n\nMany types of motor vehicles are accepted including airplanes, boats, motorcycles, trucks, and cars. If you are uncertain as to whether or not your vehicle is eligible, please contact the vehicle donation program toll free at 1-800-500-RIDE (7433).\n\nHow long will it take to pick up my vehicle?\n\nWe make donating your car as simple and convenient as possible. A tow company will contact you within two to three business days after completing a record of the donation. Call our representatives at 1-800-500-RIDE (7433).\n\nDo I have to be with the vehicle at the time of pick-up?\n\nNo. Special arrangements can be made by calling our representative.\n\nWhat paperwork do I need?\n\n\u00a0The only paperwork needed is a signed, clear title\u00a0We would prefer that you have your title with you when you call-in your donation.\u00a0[Please note: a clear title indicates the title is in the name of the donor without a lien].\n\nDo I need a smog certificate in order to donate my car?\n\nFor states that require smog certificates or safety inspections, you may donate your vehicle without these documents.\n\nWhat type of receipt will I receive for my vehicle when it is picked up?\n\nWhen your vehicle is picked up, the tow truck driver will give you a document called a \u201cdonation receipt.\u201d The donation receipt is a legal document and should be kept. Do not allow your vehicle to be picked up unless you are given a donation receipt or other\u00a0arrangements have been made in advance. If you have any questions about this please call our toll-free number, 1-800-500-RIDE (7433).\n\nWhat if I receive legal notices?\n\nIn the rare event that you receive any notification of a lien sale, DMV actions or other activity related to your donated vehicle, please contact us at 1-800-500-RIDE (7433)\u00a0immediately for assistance.\n\nWill I get a tax receipt for my donation?\n\nYes, our driver will issue a donation receipt at the time of pick-up. This is not the final tax receipt if the sale price of your vehicle exceeds $500. This initial acknowledgement will indicate the donor\u2019s name as well as the year, make, model and condition of the car being donated. It will be the only receipt if the vehicle sells for $500 or less. If that happens, it is up to the donor to determine the value of their deduction as long as it is $500 or less.\n\nHow do Federal vehicle donation laws effect my tax\u00a0deduction?\n\nFor vehicles that sell for more than $500, donors are no longer responsible for determining the deductible value of their donation. Instead, they will receive IRS Form 1098-C, Contributions of Motor Vehicles, Boats, and Airplanes if the proceeds from the sale exceed $500, stating the amount of the gross proceeds from the sale of the donated vehicle. The amount listed on IRS Form 1098-C, Contributions of Motor Vehicles, Boats, and Airplanes will be the gross proceeds of the deductible donation.\n\nWhat can I claim as a deduction?\n\nAccording to the tax law effective January 1, 2005, if the claimed value of the donated vehicle exceeds $500, the taxpayer is limited to the gross proceeds of the sale.\n\nAn IRS Form 1098-C, Contributions of Motor Vehicles, Boats, and Airplanes will be mailed to the donor within 30 days of the sale. It will state the amount of gross proceeds received from the vehicle, provided the vehicle sold for more than $500 and if the donor provided their Social Security number. This will be the tax receipt for the charitable contribution.\n\nIf a vehicle sells for $500 or less, it will be up to the donor to determine the value of their deduction as long as that figure is $500 or less.",

        "text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIn doubt about something? You can find our most frequent asked questions here.\n\n\nNo we do not sell direct from the factory. All sales are via our network of approved retailers.\n\nAs we offer no direct sales we cannot offer discounts. Only Lapierre retailers are able to decide whether or not to offer a discount.\n\nWe are not able to manufacture unique bikes coming from a specific request.\n\nWe currently do not offer customized bikes nor make specific changes to the factory bikes. If you wish to change a component of the bike, you can ask your closest dealer, who can make changes in the shop for you and inform you on prices.\n\nYou must firstly note the problem with your closest dealer (taking your receipt of purchase).\n\nThe dealer will do a diagnostic check, and send the part to the correct manufacturer (if it\u2019s a part from Shimano, Fox\u2026) or to Lapierre, if the problem is with a Lapierre product.\n\nOn reception, the Lapierre After Sales Service will investigate and propose a solution via your dealer.\n\nAs specified in our warranty conditions, certain bike-component manufacturers manage their own After Sales Service. Therefore, the warranty request will not pass via Lapierre. This is in order to address the problem by an experienced team, with an extensive knowledge of the product, the possible problems and the possible solutions.\n\nThese After Sales Services are completely independent of Lapierre and we cannot intervene in any cases that have been entrusted to them.\n\nYou should contact your closest dealer. Dealers are always our intermediary in the case of a technical problem. Any parcel delivered directly to us by the consumer will be refused.\n\nYes, you can visit any Lapierre dealer. You just need to take your purchase receipt with you.\n\nAll Lapierre dealers can also deal with a warranty request. However, they may charge you for delivery costs and workshop time.\n\nUnfortunately, we are not able to repaint frames. We advise you to contact a painter or body-work specialist in your area.\n\nWe do have a showroom. However, it is only open to Lapierre retailers and by appointment. Please note it is not open to consumers.\n\nFor confidentiality reasons, our factory is closed to the public. Due to this, we cannot unfortunately organize visits, even for groups.\n\nYou can get hold of promotional stickers by sending a stamped envelope to the address:\n\nCycles Lapierre, BP 50573, 21005 Dijon Cedex.\n\nPlease note that we do not have any decals to replace those originally on a bike following a repaint.\n\nThe serial number appears on a barcode, which is located at the bottom part of the seat tube and close to the bottom bracket. It should start with \"LP\".\n\n\nYes. Depending on the process used, this can cause weaknesses to the frame. In the case of a problem, the Lapierre After Sales Service reserves the right to refuse the warranty on a bike that has been repainted.\n\nThis guarantees a bike part, so that it can be replaced free of charge with an equivalent or superior part. Your dealer may, however, bill you for shipping costs and for the costs of replacing the part.\n\nUnfortunately, our bikes are only warrantied for the initial purchaser. When you buy a second-hand model you should ask the owner for details of transport, storage, care and any changes made to the bike.\n\nFrom 2009 to the present day, the warranty is five years for the frame (except for the Dirt, DH & Froggy : 2 years), two years for the parts, one year for the paint and artwork.\n\nFor 2008 and before, the warranty is two years for full suspension frames and five years on rigid frames, two years on parts and one year for paint and artwork.\n\nThe warranty is only valid for the initial purchaser, and is not valid if the bike is used in competitions.\n\nChoosing and buying a Lapierre product\n\nThe best thing to do at the moment is to visit your local Lapierre dealer for advice. A dealer can assess what bike size may suit better for your body type (leg measurement, arm length, etc.) and your riding style.\n\nIf you are between two sizes, you should also visit your dealer and test the two sizes in the shop.\n\nSeveral models are available in a frame kit, please check with your distributor or your local Lapierre dealer.\n\nWorking at Lapierre\n\nYou can look for our current job positions at our \u201cJobs\u201d page. If there is no offer that fits your interest, you can send us a CV and a cover letter using the contact form and detailing the position you are looking for.\n\nOur engineers are mainly specialized in mechanical engineering. All our engineers are passionate, with a professional background or related experience with bicycles. They are also proficient in English and other languages.\n\nPlease note that we do not look for engineers specialized in materials.\n\nWe sometimes offer internships in R&D and in Quality Control.

        "text":"International Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1. What can I expect while attending your flight school?\n\nOnce you are in the US you are considered a full time student pilot. Learning to fly involves developing highly coordinated eye-to-hand skills and building a solid base of aviation-related information. To maximize your learning experience plan to be at the flight school with your instructor 18-to-22 hours a week. You can expect to:\n\n  \u2022 Be scheduled 5-to-6 days a week for ground school and to fly 2-to-3 hours a day\n  \u2022 Study local area and flight procedures two hours for every hour of flight time\n  \u2022 Devote four hours a day preparing for FAA online tests, completing instructor work assignments, and accomplishing other tasks related to your training\n\n\n\n2. Do my flight training costs include housing?\n\nNo. Room and board are not included in the cost of flight training.\n\n3. If housing is NOT included will you help me find housing?\n\nYes. Our pilot candidates have a wide range of housing requirements. Some are here for a short time and require a hotel room. Others are here for a longer period of time and need more permanent accommodations, such as a shared apartment or a place of their own. An internet search may assist you in obtaining adequate housing.\n\n4. What about transportation to and from my lessons?\n\nStudents with nearby accommodations can walk or ride a bicycle to the flight school. Some students choose to purchase a car and carpool. At this time NS Aviation does not provide transportation to-and-from the school.\n\n5. Are the prices guaranteed not to change?\n\nNS Aviation reserves the right to change prices without prior notice. Due to increasing operating costs, we do not guarantee our prices, which are estimates based on the average number of hours a fulltime student takes to complete various stages of training. Individual circumstances may vary.\n\nSome students complete their training in less time than the estimates, some in more. Our goal is to give you substantial value for your training dollar. We do NOT train you beyond what you need, but we DO train you until you have achieved the standards we expect and require.\n\n6. Can an International Student obtain flight training loans in the US?\n\nNo. The only non-US students able to obtain flight training loans are those who hold permanent resident visas and have a US Social Security number.\n\n7. While I'm training, can I work in the US to defray the cost of my training?\n\nNo. The M-1 visa does not authorize a student to work in the US while in flight training. Students who come to NS Aviation MUST show proof of financial capability PRIOR to starting their flight training.\n\n8. Once I finish training, will you hire me as a Flight Instructor?\n\nVery unlikely. Students finishing their flight training MUST depart the US shortly thereafter. If a student obtains permanent US residency, without seeking NS Aviation's assistance in doing so, then we may consider your application as Flight Instructor.\n\n9. Can I obtain medical coverage? Is it included in my flight training costs?\n\nMedical coverage is NOT included in flight training costs. Often a student may obtain medical coverage through his home-country's medical plan or through his travel agent. An internet search may be your best option to find adequate medical coverage.\n\n10. How is the scheduling done at NS Aviation?\n\nScheduling is done through our dispatch desk. You will coordinate with your instructor to ensure the appropriate scheduling is done according to your training phase, aircraft availability, etc.\n\n11. I'm in the country on H1-B or F1, or similar visa. Can I do flight training on my current visa?\n\nYou may ONLY train on an M-1 visa. See our international student\u2019s page. If you are in the US on some other visa, you MUST exit the country and re-enter on an M-1 visa. We can assist you with this process.\n\n12. Do you have somebody on staff that can help me with other questions?\n\nWe welcome student inquiries, and look forward to assist you in whatever way possible to the best of our ability.",
