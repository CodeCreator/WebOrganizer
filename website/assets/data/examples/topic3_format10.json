        "text":"Deportation of 62 Islamists Stalls Over Lack of Identification Papers\n\nDeportation of 62 Islamists Stalls Over Lack of Identification Papers\n\n\nThe German government has identified 62 dangerous Islamists that it wants to deport to their native countries but is having issues because many of them lack proper identification.\n\nGermany has been having great difficulty\u00a0deporting\u00a0failed asylum seekers who come mainly from the North and West African regions despite many of them being convicted criminals.\u00a0New revelations suggest\u00a0that the deportation problem has extended\u00a0even to known Islamists that the government sees as a threat.\n\nMany Islamist suspects do not have the correct identification documents lack the proper paperwork for their countries of origin to take them back,\u00a0Die Welt\u00a0reports.\n\nThe 62 Islamists who have been classified\u00a0by the police as \u201cvulnerable\u201d are part of a group of 224 identified Islamist supporters and potential terrorists. Police say that 80 of those Islamists are already in custody.\n\nThe police force and the domestic intelligence agency, known as the Office for the Protection of the Consitution, believe the suspects all have the potential and are\u00a0likely to carry out terror operations in the country.\n\nThe Islamists have been identified by police\u00a0in the wake of the Berlin terror attack last month which killed 12 and injured close to 50 others at a Christmas market near the centre of the city.\n\nThe attacker, Tunisian asylum seeker\u00a0Anis Amri, had been known to police long before the attack and was supposed to have been\u00a0deported, his return stalled by his lack of proper paperwork.\n\nAmri was known by authorities to have had\u00a0cconnections\u00a0with Islamic State terror who claimed responsibility or the attack.\n\nAccording to investigators, Amri had contact with at least 20 mosques across Germany, many of them adhering to the radical Salafist philosophy that Islamic State endorses.\n\nOne of the mosques he visited was the DIK Mosque in Hildesheim which authorities say has become a hotbed for Islamic State recruitment and Salafist teaching. Amri is said to have encouraged Salafist followers to stage their own attacks.\n\nResponses to the lack of deportation have been mixed. Joachim Herrmann of the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) has demanded the arrest of Islamists who have no documents while others, like\u00a0Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the Socialist party, have argued that Islamists could be tagged with ankle bracelets to allow authorities to keep tabs on their movements.\n\nMany questions surrounding the background of the Berlin attack still remain unanswered. CSU politician\u00a0Stephan Mayer said he could not understand why the left-wing Berlin city coalition government had not set up an investigation themselves. \u00a0\u201cMistakes in the security authorities must be analysed, reprocessed, and consistently remedied,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Berlin \u201cred-red-green\u201d government recently released a paper indicating they are more concerned with tackling\u00a0right-wing extremism\u00a0than Islamic terrorism and failed to acknowledge that left-wing extremism even existed.",

He admitted to a lesser charge and was sentenced to a suspended jail term and other conditions, including sexual offender registration.\n\nCANTON\u00a0 A Plain Township man pleaded guilty to a reduced charge in a rape case and was sentenced to suspended jail time and other conditions.\n\nMichael V. Williams, 20, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to unlawful sexual conduct with a minor in Stark County Common Pleas Court.\n\nJudge Taryn Heath sentenced Williams to a six-month suspended jail sentence; he was given credit for already serving two months in jail following his arrest. Williams also must successfully complete a sexual offender assessment and register as a sexual offender annually for the next 15 years. The defendant also was fined $250 and assessed court costs.\n\nThe rape charge, a first-degree felony that bring a prison term of up to 11 years, was reduced to a misdemeanor as part of a plea agreement reached with the Stark County Prosecutor's Office.\n\nWilliams was accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl at a party in Canton in 2015, said Christy Donnelly, an assistant Stark County prosecutor. Williams and the girl had met at a party hosted by a mutual acquaintance.\n\nThe prosecutor's office accused Williams of taking advantage of the girl while she was inebriated and having sex with her against her will.\n\nWilliams said the sex was consensual, said defense attorney Rick Pitinii.\n\nDonnelly said the prosecution had some evidentiary issues, including differing statements from witnesses who attended the party. The plea agreement also spared the girl from the trauma of having to testify at trial, the assistant prosecutor said. The sexual offender treatment program and registration are important parts of the agreement, Donnelly said.\n\n\"These cases can sometimes be very difficult when one party alleges the sex was consensual,\" she said.\u00a0\n\nA July 17 review hearing has been set for Williams to ensure he's meeting conditions of the sentence. Violating the terms could result in a four-month jail sentence, Donnelly said.\n\nReach Ed at 330-580-8315\n\nand ed.balint@cantonrep.com\n\nOn Twitter @ebalintREP",

Begging is also banned on the Boardwalk, within 150 feet of any signalized intersection and within 100 feet of any daycare center or school including pre-kindergarten through grade 12.\n\nThe measure also lays out panhandling behavior that won\u2019t be tolerated. The list includes approaching people in vehicles to aggressively beg; soliciting people at outdoor dining and merchandise areas; trying to coax money out of people when they\u2019re standing in line waiting to enter a business; touching a target of panhandling without the person\u2019s consent; and using profane or abusive language when refused money.\n\nThere are also prohibitions now on panhandling after dark and while a beggar is under the influence of alcohol or illegally used drugs.\n\nThe new ordinance describes aggressive panhandling as getting within two feet of someone, using abusive language and talking loudly. It could also be walking next to someone after they refuse to give money or blocking a person on foot or in a vehicle from getting away from the panhandler.\n\nArrested on Saturday were Joseph Raico, 53, of Port Orange and David Brown, 49, of Holly Hill. On Sunday police arrested Corey Webb, 29; Harold Allen, 55; Jeremiah Marcelle, 35; and James Gable, 68, all of Daytona Beach.",

When the effects of the flash-bang wore off, the officer realized there was a person on the couch. As the officer aimed his weapon at the couch where the child was sleeping beneath a \u201cHanna Montana\u201d blanket, he claims her grandmother, Mertilla Jones, smacked his MP5 submachine gun, causing him to pull the trigger and kill Aiyana.\n\nMertilla Jones disputes this claim and says that she reached for her granddaughter when the grenade came through the window, not for the officer\u2019s gun, and did not make contact with an officer at any point during the assault on her home. Her fingerprints were not found on the weapon.\n\nWhile the exact circumstances surrounding the death are unclear, the lawsuit states: \u201cDefendants Joseph Weekley and Robert Rowe unlawfully seized Aiyana Stanley-Jones, used excessive force against her and unlawfully used deadly force thereby inflicting horrendous personal injuries and ultimately death from which certain damages naturally followed to the members of Aiyana Stanley-Jones family and\/or estate.\u201d\n\nWeekley previously faced a jury twice after the shooting, both trials dismissed.\n\nNamed as defendants in the lawsuit include the city of Detroit, Officers Weekley and Rowe, The Detroit Police Department, and approximately 20 unidentified members of the Special Response Team.\n\nAll defendants are accused of conspiracy in the suit, which states: \u201cUpon Defendants realizing that they had critically injured the seven-year-old girl, they intentionally conspired to cover-up their unlawful acts by providing false and fictitious information to the authorities and to the media regarding the shooting of Aiyana Stanley-Jones, including falsely claiming that the bullet that killed her was fired from inside the lower unit of the duplex rather than from the outside\u2026\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by attorney Geoffrey Fieger, seeks damages for the family of at least $75,000, and the family has requested a trial by jury.\n\n\nBy: Josie Wales\n\n\nGeoffry Fieger Aiyana Jones Presser\n\n- Advertisment -\n\nTrending Articles",

        "text":"License article\n\nSex, Skype and ridicule: an isolated incident or an ingrained problem?\n\nThe broadcasting of a young cadet having sex at the Australian Defence Force Academy was an ''abhorrent'' but ''isolated'' incident, says the chief of the defence force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston.\n\nThe cadet was covertly filmed 12 days ago and the footage broadcast via Skype to fellow students.\n\nDefending the military against claims that it was still in the Dark Ages about gender issues, the Defence chief said he was ''passionate'' about attracting more women into Defence.\n\n''Fundamentally, the incident involved 18-year-olds who had been in the defence force for around 10 weeks, and that's something that's been a little bit lost in some of the media commentary,'' he told The Saturday Age.\n\n''If you draw comparisons against similar institutions - I am talking about university campuses - I think the number of incidents of this kind is less at ADFA than at any other campus in the country \u2026 .\n\n''Having said that, we have [things in] common with a lot of those institutions. This generation at universities tends to work very hard and then all of them, when they go out at weekends, they tend to \u2026 indulge in what I call binge drinking.''\n\n\nHe refused to answer specific questions about the incident, saying natural justice and due process would not be served if he did. ''I just am absolutely shocked by it. We will ensure that it is fully investigated and those that are found to have failed in their responsibilities will be dealt with accordingly.''\n\nKate, the 18-year-old cadet who was covertly filmed, knew nothing of the incident until military investigators told her about it three days later.\n\nAccording to Channel Ten reporters Hugh Riminton and Matt Moran, who have had exclusive access to her since she came to them with the story, the investigators had been tipped off by another cadet disturbed by photos of the incident circulating on mobile phones.\n\nKate threw up when she was told what had happened. Walking onto the ADFA campus, she found herself the subject of whispers and sniggers. So when investigators told her the culprits were likely to get off with a relatively minor ''prejudicial conduct'' charge, she rang Channel Ten.\n\nThe saga has thrown the defence hierarchy into crisis, and opened deep divisions within the broader defence community over whether the ADFA commandant, Bruce Kafer, has been unfairly scapegoated for his handling of the mess.\n\nDefence Minister Stephen Smith showed a rare flash of anger this week when told Kate had been put through disciplinary proceedings on unrelated matters even as the Skype scandal was unfolding. The military had been ''stupid in fact and in law'' to allow that to occur, he told reporters.\n\nOther defence insiders have described Commodore Kafer as respected but ''old school'' and more likely to believe that such incidents should be dealt with quietly within the force.\n\n''The hierarchy has turned a blind eye to sex at both RMC (the Royal Military College) and ADFA over the past 10 years, so watch out for changes, as some of the incidents were typical of what you'd find in a uni environment,'' one source said.\n\nFinger-pointing is also taking place between the ACT police and the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service, with no one yet able to explain why police initially thought no offence had been committed.\n\nPolice sources claim the defence brief was faulty in the first instance, defence sources suggest the police did not do their initial job properly.\n\nYet the public perception is that defence is struggling to contain another in a disturbingly regular parade of sex scandals.\n\nAs recently as February, retired NSW judge Roger Gyles flayed the navy over a culture of predatory sexual behaviour, which he had uncovered on board HMAS Success.\n\nThe defence force academy too has form. Thirteen years ago a damning report on sexual assault and harassment at ADFA found nearly half of female cadets had experienced ''unwanted gender or sex-related behaviours''.\n\nThe head of defence at the time, General John Baker, said he hoped to see signs of improvement within a year.\n\nFormer Air Force officer Mark Farmer came forward this week to brief The Saturday Age on other instances of predatory sexual behaviour at the elite academy in 2006.\n\nPerhaps his most damaging allegation was that some sexual assaults had been recategorised as common assaults, to take them out of civilian courts.\n\n''There was just an entire culture of 'we group together, we look after our own, stuff everyone else','' Mr Farmer said.\n\nContrary views have come from some parents of other students. One with a daughter in the same year as Kate expressed anger at the perception that Commodore Kafer's authority was being undermined and said her daughter was ''ropeable that as a young woman in ADFA she is now being painted as victim. She has nothing but praise for the academy.''\n\nAir Chief Marshal Houston said he was strongly committed to widening female participation in the military and indicated a personal view that women should be allowed into infantry combat roles, which are now closed to them.

The engine from Hand\u2019s car detached and hit the Volkswagen which was travelling eastbound.\n\nSadly the driver of the Nissan, 56-year-old Gail Brown, of Lowry Close in Haverhill, Suffolk, sustained fatal injuries and died at the scene.\n\nA 43-year-old man who was driving the Volkswagen suffered minor injuries.\n\nAt the roadside Hand admitted to the attending officer that she had consumed about half a bottle of vodka and provided a positive breath test of 90 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath \u2013 the legal limit is 35. She also tested positive for cannabis following a roadside drugs test.\n\nHand was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and was escorted by police to Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge to be treated for serious injuries.\n\nIn interview, Hand admitted being dependant on cannabis and alcohol and had also consumed cocaine that morning and the night before.\n\nHand appeared before Cambridge Crown Court today (Friday, February 2) charged with two counts of causing death by careless driving while unfit through drugs (in relation to cannabis and cocaine), and causing death by careless driving while over the prescribed alcohol limit.\n\nShe pleaded guilty to all three charges and was sentenced to a total of eight years in prison.\n\nPC James Thorne, from the Beds, Cambs and Herts Forensic Collision Investigation Unit (FCIU), said: \u201cThis is an extremely sad case where a woman lost her life because of the selfish actions of another.\n\n\u201cWhile Hand fully accepted what she had done and is very remorseful for her actions, there is absolutely no excuse to ever get behind the wheel while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\u201d\n\nFor information about drink or drug driving, visit the Cambridgeshire Constabulary website here www.cambs.police.uk\/drinkdrugdriving.\n\nMore news stories\n\nThe number of child sex offences recorded by Essex Police rose to 1,531 last year, according to the NSPCC, increasing from 1,449 offences recorded the previous year.\n\nA former pub at the heart of an Uttlesford village was sold for more than \u00a3300,000 at auction earlier this month.\n\nYesterday, 08:04\n\nVolunteer Police Cadets from Braintree and Uttlesford made a trip to Westminster on February 12 to develop their understanding of law and democracy.\n\nYesterday, 07:58\n\nHundreds of defibrillators in communities across East Anglia will have to be checked for battery failures after several had problems, including one where a man from Cambridgeshire died.\n\nDigital Edition\n\nRead the Dunmow Broadcast e-edition E-edition\n\nMost read stories\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\n\nSign up to receive our regular email newsletter",

        "text":"UPDATE: Thieves target two Lancaster cash machines\n\nThe scene at Booths in Lancaster\nThe scene at Booths in Lancaster\nShare this article\n\nDetectives are investigating two cash machine burglaries in Lancaster.\n\nThe first incident happened at Booths supermarket in Hala Road at around 2am on Thursday May 24.\n\nIt is believed thieves have tried to drag an ATM out through a window at the rear of the store with the assistance of a Land Rover and some straps.\n\nIt is not yet clear how much cash they got away with.\n\nAfter around 10 minutes, the thieves were disturbed and made off from the area.\n\nOfficers are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen a Land Rover, a silver Volvo estate and a dark Fiesta-type vehicle in the area at the time.\n\nDI Steve Harry from Lancaster Police said: \u201cWe are still in the very early stages of our investigation and need anyone who may have witnessed these cars either acting suspiciously or driving at speed in the build-up or after the burglary to come forward.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, if you have any information that could assist us with our investigation, please speak to us.\u201d\n\nIt is thought that the burglary is linked to a second similar incident at the BP fuel station in Scotforth Road, where another cash machine was targeted around the same time. The offenders have again tried to steal the ATM but made off without any money.\n\nAnyone with information about these incidents can call 01524 596466 or if you fail to get an answer, 101, quoting incident reference 114 of May 24th. Alternatively independent charity Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555111 or online at crimestoppers-uk.org.\n\nA spokesperson for Booths said: \u201cFollowing a break-in at the Scotforth Booths, on Hala Road, our store teams are liaising with police and will supply them with CCTV records.\n\n\u201cThe store is open as usual today and all staff are safe and well.\u201d\n\nThese types of crimes are on the increase both locally and across the UK.\n\nLast month, thieves used a stolen JCB to smash through the wall of the Co-Op in Carnforth in an attempt to steal the cash machine.\n\nIn March, thieves who tried to steal a cash machine from the Co-Op in Ingleton were thwarted after crashing the ATM into a parked car while towing it along on a rope.\n\nThere have been many reports from across the UK of similar attempts to steal cash machines from supermarkets.",

Under those rules, police grant annual operating permits to collectives, and the police chief may inspect a collective\u2019s books, records, accounts and any other material that would allow authorities to determine whether a cannabis club is distributing medical marijuana to qualified patients.\n\nRedding charges dispensaries a $1,560 application fee and an annual permit fee of $1,474.\n\n\u201c( The lawsuit ) invalidated Long Beach\u2019s ordinance, which is very similar to ours, so we have to talk about that and decide what we want to do,\u201d City Attorney Rick Duvernay said Thursday.\n\nThe council discussed the lawsuit in closed session Tuesday but took no reportable action.\n\nHansen said he hasn\u2019t yet written the letters but will do so soon.\n\nThe discussion will likely happen at the council\u2019s next meeting, scheduled for Nov. 15, Assistant City Manager Barry Tippin said.\n\nSource: Record Searchlight (Redding, CA)\nCopyright: 2011 Record Searchlight\nContact: [email\u00a0protected]\nWebsite: Redding Record Searchlight: Local Redding, California News Delivered Throughout the Day.",

Hummel entered the home and pretended to attack Todd, who then feigned unconsciousness. Hummel then took a bottle of prescription Percocet. Todd left the home and met up with Hummel to divide the drugs. Todd later admitted to police that he helped plan the robbery.\n\nScott Todd Charging Documents\n\nDuring his court appearance from the jail, instead of wearing the traditional orange jumpsuit, Hummel had on a special garment for his own protection, according to Missoula County jail personnel.\n\nThe female suspect, Leanna Hoff, failed to appear in justice court, and Judge Odlin issued a $50,000 warrant for her arrest. Hoff allegedly drove the other two suspects and helped to plan the robbery.
