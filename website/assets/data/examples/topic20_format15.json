        "text":"Monday, December 22, 2014\n\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop Preview V8.1.7 update for Windows Phone 8.1 available today for download\n\nThere is a new version available of the Microsoft Remote Desktop App for Windows Phone 8.1\n\nThe new features in this release are:\n\nPinning apps to the Start Screen\nThe ability to pin separate Remote Apps on the Start Screen of your Windows PhoneFigure2\n\nBackground refresh and notifications\nIf the list of apps available to you has changed (for example when your IT admin publishes new apps), then the list of apps on the apps pivot will be updated to reflect the changes which could include adding or removing entries.\n\n\nSource & more info:\n\nTuesday, December 16, 2014\n\nFirst Glance at Ericom AccessNow for Microsoft RD Connection Broker (RDCB)\n\nI\u2019ve had the honor and pleasure of test-driving Ericom AccessNow for RDCB during the private beta, and providing Ericom with some early feedback. In this blog post I\u2019d like to share some of my experiences with the beta.\n\nA little background info\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop Services has evolved a lot over the past few years. The release of Windows Server 2012 (and later R2) represented a huge step forward, with major improvements in both user experience, by way of the\nRemoteFX (RDP8) Protocol, and in central management via Server Manager. On the RDP client side, previously Microsoft\u2019s statement had always been, \u201cwe\u2019ll deliver a great RDP client for Windows based devices and leave space for partners to do so for RDP clients for non-Windows based devices\u201d. That all changed in October of 2013 when Microsoft launched their own RDP clients for iOS, Android and Mac OS X, available as a free download in the various App Stores, making it possible to run a Microsoft RDP client on various operating systems.\n\nWhere does AccessNow for RDCB step in?\nMicrosoft however does currently not provide their own HTML5 client for Remote Desktop Services. So what\u2019s the use case for an HTML5 solution, with the availability of a Microsoft RDP client for most major operating systems? I personally don\u2019t see an HTML5 client being the primary client in all scenarios. However, supporting HTML5 in a Microsoft RDS environment can help organizations that are implementing BYOD initiatives to simplify their client software management. It also makes a great second or backup option in specific\u00a0 scenarios where a user cannot install an RDP client, or only needs to connect real quickly to review a document without having to install and configure a client first. This is where\nAccessNow for RDCB steps in.\n\nWhat I personally like about this approach is that you can integrate this with your current Microsoft RDS environment without having to replace or reconfigure anything. That way, you can offer the option to connect via HTML5 and have that be a backup or secondary way of connecting.\n\nInstalling AccessNow Beta in the lab\nI\u2019ve been test-driving AccessNow for RDCB in my lab. I cannot go into too much detail about the installation process and the architecture itself, because Ericom is not disclosing that information at this time. What I can say, however, is that I\u2019m impressed by the ease of install and the smooth way of incorporating it with an existing RDS deployment. I did provide some feedback on the chosen backend architecture, installation process and the deployment guide, so hopefully some of that feedback makes it into the General Availability version.\n\nEnd user experience\nAs an end user, you log in via a Web Access Portal that is created during installation. Obviously this can (and should) be HTTPS, but for the sake of this demo I used HTTP.\n\n\nAfter logging in with your domain credentials, you are presented with the remote applications and desktops that have been assigned to you. The Ericom Portal retrieves those using your existing RDS deployment.\n\n\nThus, you will see the same applications that are available to you when logging in with the same user account using, say, RD Web Access.\n\n\nAs an end user, you simply click on a remote application (RemoteApp) to trigger the login process. Basically, this launches an RDP session with the RD Connection Broker as the initial connection, which then directs users to an RD Session Host, similar to a regular RDS session.\n\n\nAfter the login process, users can begin using the RemoteApp from within the browser, without the need to install any agent, fully based on HTML5. Of course, you can also publish a full desktop session in the same way.\n\n\nIn conclusion, integration of AccessNow for RDCB in the existing environment makes it really easy to set up and provide HTML5 browser based access to your end users as a secondary means of connection as well as for supporting BYOD scenarios, fulfilling the needs of various use cases. I\u2019m looking forward to the GA of AccessNow for RDCB as well as the accompanying licensing models!\n\nEricom plans to announce the GA release of AccessNow for RDCB soon! To learn more about Ericom AccessNow for RDCB visit:\n\nUpdate: some people asked for this, here is an overview of the other options in the portal\n\n\nThursday, December 11, 2014\n\nTaking a look at the new HTML5 connector in Dell\/Wyse vWorkspace 8.5\n\nDell\/Wyse has released the latest version of their vWorkspace product this week, which is version 8.5! I have been upgrading a first environment this week, which went smooth.\n\nFor an overview of all that\u2019s new in 8.5, see:\n\nIn this blog post I\u2019ll focus on a specific new feature, the HTML5 connector. The HTML5 connector allows users to connect to applications or desktops without having to install a vWorkspace connector. HTML5 can be enabled or disabled for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux and Chrome OS.\n\nObviously the experience of running a RemoteApp or Desktop on a (installed) connectors or RDP client is much better than HTML5. In most use cases HTML5 will therefor not be the primary way of connecting. However, it does allows users to connect to applications or desktops without having to install a connector or client. Which makes a great way of providing a secondary or backup way of connecting in situations were users are not allowed to install or configure a client locally or just want to check a document real quick on a device they\u2019ve never used before and don\u2019t want to download, install and configure a connector or client first. Or, in case of using one of the few devices for which a vWorkspace connector is not available (like e.g. Windows RT).\n\nHTML5 can be enabled an configured within the vWorkspace management console on a per client type level.\n\n\nAfter doing so, you log on to vWorkspace Web Access (which is also improved to support scales to the size and orientation of the endpoint device).\n\n\nYou select a Remote App\n\n\nAnd after logon we are now running multiple RemoteApps inside our browser, bases on HTML5, without installing any client.\n\n\nDo note that in most scenario\u2019s you will see NLA enabled in an environment. By default however, NLA is disabled for the vWorkspace HTML5 connector. To enable HTML5, edit the following file C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\web\\Freezer\\Web.Config\n\nAnd set EnableNLA to the value true.\n\n\nAzure RemoteApp is GA, previously created Previews are changed to a 30-day trial\n\nIt\u2019s December 11th today, which means Azure RemoteApp is now officially generally available.\n\nIf you previously signed up the the Free Preview, that preview is now automatically changes to a 30-day trial. If you open the Azure Portal and browse to your Azure RemoteApp you will be notified with the ability to activate the service.\n\n\nFor more info on Azure RemoteApp also see: or join the LinkedIn group here\n\nFriday, December 5, 2014\n\nAzure RemoteApp Series \u2013 Weekly Ask the Experts Webinar\n\nYesterday was the announcement on the GA date of Microsoft Azure RemoteApp, December 11th, 2014. Basically, next week! :) Back in October I attended TechEd Europe in Madrid, staffing the Microsoft Desktop Virtualization booth, which was fully dedicated in Azure RemoteApp. Back then, the interest and attention for this service was already huge. Overall, the interest for the service has been growing a lot over the past few months.\n\nThe Remote Desktop Services team is running a Azure RemoteApp Series \u2013 Weekly Ask the Experts Webinar series, you can join here to attend the webinars:\n\n\nAnd here are some links of recordings of previous sessions:\n\n11\/19 webinar\n\n12\/3 webinar\n\nThursday, December 4, 2014\n\nAzure RemoteApp (ARA) will be GA on December 11 2014, pricing model is online!\n\nimageFaster then anyone expected, we RDS MVP\u2019s were notified earlier, but it was just announced publicly that Azure RemoteApp will be GA on December 11, 2014!!\n\n\u201cAzure RemoteApp will be generally available on December 11, 2014. Existing preview customers\u2019 subscriptions will automatically be transferred to a 30-day free trial at this date.\n\nThe service will be available as Pay-As-You-Go on Azure starting December 11, 2014. Customers will also be able to purchase Azure RemoteApp through a Volume Licensing\/Azure Plan SKU starting February 1, 2015.\u201d\n\n\nThe pricing model is also announced:\n\n\nMore info on billing check out:\n\nWednesday, December 3, 2014\n\nAzure RemoteApp (ARA) now supporting Office 365 ProPlus!\n\nThe Microsoft RDV Team released a new bog post about support for Office 365 in Azure RemoteApp (ARA).

        "text":"AutoCAD 2009 \u2013 Ribbon content for Express Tools\n\nOne of the many unfinished aspects of the AutoCAD 2009 Ribbon is the lack of Express Tools content. One enterprising user has put the effort into correcting this, and has posted an Express Tools CUI replacement in this Autodesk newsgroup thread. I have not tested this myself. As usual with CUI, be paranoid. Back up everything before you touch anything.\n\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t normally suggest you do any Ribbon custom work in 2009 in its current state, it shouldn\u2019t hurt in this case as it should be easily redoable once Autodesk has fixed up the worst of the 2009 CUI problems. Anything else you do should be considered as disposable. The problems with 2009\u2019s CUI are so fundamental that it is quite likely a restructure will be required to fix them, either in a service pack or in 2010. That means your 2009 CUI efforts may need to be redone, just like your AutoCAD 2008 Dashboard modifications.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Puppy reaction while watching the Google updates list of 2011I must admit that lately Google is the cause of my headaches.\n\nNo, not just because it decided I was not going to be not provided with useful information about my sites. And neither because it is changing practically every tool I got used since my first days as an SEO (Google Analytics, Webmaster Tools, Gmail\u2026). And, honestly, not only because it released a ravenous Panda.\n\nNo, the real question that is causing my headaches is: What the hell does Google want to go with all these changes?\n\nLet me start quoting the definition of SEO Google gives in its Guidelines:\n\nSearch engine optimization is about putting your site's best foot forward when it comes to visibility in search engines, but your ultimate consumers are your users, not search engines.\n\nTechnical SEO still matters, a lot!\n\nIf you want to put your site\u2019s best foot forward and make it the most visible possible in search engines, then you have to be a master in technical SEO.\n\nWe all know that if we do not pay attention to the navigation architecture of our site, if we don't care about the on-page optimization, if we mess up with the rel=\u201dcanonical\u201d tag, the pagination and the faceted navigation of our web, and if we don\u2019t pay attention to the internal content duplication, etc. etc., well, we are not going to go that far with Search.\n\nIs all this obvious? Yes, it is. But people in our circle tend to pay attention just to the last bright shining object and forget what one of the basic pillars of our discipline is: make a site optimized to be visible in the search engines.\n\nThe next time you hear someone saying \u201cContent is King\u201d or \u201cSocial is the new link building\u201d, snap her face and ask her when it was the last time she logged in Google Webmaster Tools.\n\nGo fix your site, make it indexable and solve all the technical problems it may have. Just after done that, you can start doing all the rest.\n\nUser is king\n\nTechnical SEO still matters, but that does not mean that it is synonym of SEO. So, if you hear someone affirming it, please snap her face too.\n\nNo... content is not the only King. User is the King! Image by Jeff Gregory\n\nUser and useful have the same root: use. And a user finds useful a website when it offers an answer to her needs, and if its use is easy and fast..\n\nFrom the point of view that Google has of User, that means that a site to rank:\n\n  1. must be fast;\n  2. must have useful content and related to what it pretends to be about;\n  3. must be presented to Google so that it can understand the best it can what it is about.\n\nThe first point explains the emphasis Google gives to site speed, because it is really highly correlated to a better user experience.\n\nThe second is related to the quality of the content of a site, and it is substantially what Panda is all about. Panda, if we want to reduce it at its minimal terms, is the attempt by Google of cleaning its SERPs of any content it does not consider useful for the end users.\n\nThe third explains the Schema.org adoption and why Google (and the other Search Engines) are definitely moving to the Semantic Web: because it helps search engines organize the bazillion contents they index every second. And the most they understand really what is your content about, the better they will deliver it in the SERPs.\n\nThe link graph mappedThe decline of Link graph\n\nWe all know that just with on-site optimization we cannot win the SERPs war, and that we need links to our site to make it authoritative. But we all know how much the link graph can be gamed.\n\nEven though we still have tons of reasons to complain with Google about the quality of SERPs, especially due to sites that ranks thanks to manipulative link building tactics, it is hard for me to believe that Google is doing nothing in order to counteract this situation. What I believe is that Google has decided to solve the problem not with patches but with a totally new kind of graph.\n\nThat does not mean that links are not needed anymore, not at all, as links related factors still represent (and will represent) a great portion of all the ranking factors, but other factors are now cooked in the ranking pot.\n\nBe Social and become a trusted seed\n\nIn a Social-Caffeinated era, the faster way to understand if a content is popular is to check its \"relative\" popularity in the social media environment. I say \u201crelative\u201d, because not all contents are the same and if a meme needs many tweets, +1 and likes\/share to be considered more popular than others, it is not so for more niche kind of contents. Combining social signals with the traditional link graph, Google can understand the real popularity of a page.\n\nThe problem, as many are saying since almost one year, is that it is quite easy to spam in Social Media.\n\nThe Facebook Social Graph from Silicon Angle\n\nFor this reason Google introduced the concepts of Author and Publisher and, even more important, Google linked them to the Google Profiles and is pushing Google Plus, which is not just another Social Media, but what Google aims to be in the future: a social search engine.\n\nRel=\u201dauthor\u201d and Rel=\u201dpublisher\u201d are the solution Google is adopting in order to better control, within other things, the spam pollution of the SERPs.\n\nIf you are a blogger, you will be incentivized in marking your content with Author and link it to your G+ Profile, and as a Site, you are incentivized to create your G+ Business page and to promote it with a badge on you site that has the rel=\u201dpublisher\u201d in its code.\n\nTrusted seeds are not anymore only sites, but can be also persons (i.e.: Rand or Danny Sullivan) or social facets of an entity\u2026 so, the closer I am in the Social Graph to those persons\/\/entity the more trusted I am to Google eyes.\n\nThe new Google graph\n\nAs we can see, Google is not trying to rely only on the link graph, as it is quite easy to game, but it is not simply adding the social signals to the link graph, because they too can be gamed. What Google is doing is creating and refining a new graph that see cooperating Link graph, Social graph and Trust graph and which is possibly harder to game. Because it can be gamed still, but \u2013 hopefully \u2013 needing so many efforts that it may become not-viable as a practice.\n\nWake up SEOs, the new Google is here\n\nAs a conclusion, let me borrow what Larry Page wrote on Google+ (bold is mine):\n\nOur ultimate ambition is to transform the overall Google experience [\u2026] because we understand what you want and can deliver it instantly.\n\nThis means baking identity and sharing into all of our products so that we build a real relationship with our users. Sharing on the web will be like sharing in real life across all your stuff. You\u2019ll have better, more relevant search results and ads.\n\nThink about it this way \u2026 last quarter, we\u2019ve shipped the +, and now we\u2019re going to ship the Google part.\n\nI think that it says it all and what we have lived a year now is explained clearly by the Larry Page words.\n\nWhat can we do as SEOs? Evolve, because SEO is not dieing, but SEOs can if they don\u2019t assume that winter - oops - the change of Google is coming.\n\nThe New SEO graph",

(His prose is stinky as usual.) What online pioneers knew all too well - and they've said this often, as I've interviewed dozens of the clever geeks - was that the authorities and telecoms were always watching.\n\nHacker horror stories were common in the media many years before regular Americans were signing up with AOL in the mid-1990s. It was this very fear of someone watching that kept the first consumer Web users paranoid about credit-card theft or (in the Waco days) Clintonian surveillance of any message-board commenter with a vaguely anti-governmnet view.\n\nOne could say with some authority that it wasn't until this century - the past few years - that online activity became comfortable for the general public.

        "text":"\u2605 Mac App Recommendation: Sparrow\n\nToday marks the official launch of Sparrow, a new mail app for the Mac. I've been using it in beta for the last few months, and am very impressed with how the app has grown and changed. It's Gmail-only at the moment; support for services like Yahoo, MobileMe, and custom IMAP email should arrive at the beginning of next month. Once that hits, I'll be kissing Apple's own Mail.app goodbye for good. Sparrow has significance beyond being an exceptional mail app. Along with Twitter for Mac and the upcoming Reeder for Mac (an Google Reader client currently in public beta), Sparrow is a harbinger of Mac apps to come. Although clearly influenced by the iOS experience, these apps are hardly clones of their iPad counterparts. They are fully integrated into OS X, and reflect a sensibility at the heart of the Mac experience since 1984: minimalism and form-as-function. After decades of increasingly complex, feature-rich applications, we're finally getting back to the essence of what each of these programs is supposed to do.\n\nIt's a change that even our language reflects. No longer do we refer to \"applications\" in conversation. Instead, we talk about apps - shorter, simpler, and with all of the meaning that needs to be conveyed. And as this new generation of apps prepares to take the Mac landscape by storm - a trend I expect to only accelerate with the launch of OS X Lion later this year - we can expect to see smaller windows on our screens, simpler-but-speedier functionality, and a more tightly focused user experience. Will they do everything? No. But they'll do 100% of what we need to do 95% of the time using less memory and costing us less money than whatever we're using now. It's a brave new world, Mac users, and it only gets better from here.\n\nAnd Windows users... well, enjoy Outlook.",

But this\nis not, as some people and media reports would have you believe, a new Internet\n\u2013 rather, it is a decades-old promise finally coming true.\n\nMore than a year ago I said that 2006 would be the year that\nblogging passes from novelty into utility, and it did \u2013 blogs are not only\nmainstream media themselves, but they are a staple of traditional media news\nsites. The same shift is now happening with social networks, albeit with a significant\n\nBlogs were something new, a powerful self-publishing tool\nthat opened the door to a \u201cread-write\u201d web. Moreover, blogs will always be a\npart of the web, not the web in its entirety.\n\nBut social networks \u2013\nor to be more exact, technologies that allow people to interact and share ideas\nand content instantaneously \u2013 are becoming the Web\n. Eventually, the\nInternet itself will be one, giant, global social network, created by and for\n\nThe First Wave \u2013\nGated Communities\n\nYou can\u2019t scratch the Internet today without finding the\nword \u201csocial.\u201d Instead of building static web sites, corporations are now\nbuilding their own \u201csocial networks.\u201d Cisco Systems, which owns a social\nnetwork development company, is purchasing Tribe.Net\u2019s technology so it can\nbuild networks for corporate customers.\n\nNike has a social network. So do Carnival Cruises and\nSheraton hotels. There are hundreds of social networks with more going online all\nthe time \u2013 and while acting as separate membership communities, almost all have\nthe same \u201csocial\u201d features like blogs, audio and video sharing, messaging and\nfriends lists.\n\nThese types of social networks \u2013 led by the likes of\npowerhouses MySpace and Facebook, Bebo and Gather \u2013 represent the first wave. They\ngive members freedom but within certain parameters and interfaces. They are not\nso much closed communities but \u201cgated\u201d ones, where members must act and express\nthemselves in certain ways or discuss defined topics. Think of it as being part\nof a homeowner\u2019s association that allows everyone to have a garage as long as\nit\u2019s painted one of five pre-approved colors (sounds strange, but I live in Orange County, Calif., where this really happens.)\n\nThe Second Wave \u2013 An\nInternet Built With Bridges\n\nBut if Internet users hate anything, they hate constraint. A\nsecond wave of social networks promises to remove all constraint \u2013 in effect,\nto disband the homeowner\u2019s association and let people paint their garages\nwhatever color they want.\n\nThese networks \u2013 networks like Second Life and Ning, the\nlatest brainchild from Netscape founder Marc Andreessen \u2013 aim to turn the\nInternet into a tabula rasa where customization is king. According to a recent\nNew York Times article, Ning allows \u201canyone to set up a community on any\ntopic\u2026Ning users choose the features they want to include, like videos, photos,\ndiscussion forums or blogs. Their sites can appear like MySpace, YouTube or the\nphoto sharing site Flickr \u2013 or something singular.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, standards like OpenID hope to make identity\ntransferable from community to community. Just think \u2013 an Internet of true\nimagination, entire worlds that people build themselves. An Internet built not\nwith walls or gates, but with bridges.\n\nPeople Make It Social,\nNot Technology\n\nFor this to happen we need to do our part, too:\n\n  \u2022 We need to change our thinking of the Internet as something that includes social networks to something that is a social network.\n  \u2022 Technology allows media to be shared, but technology alone doesn\u2019t make blogs or RSS feeds or tagging \u201csocial.\u201d Only people can do that. In other words, a blog is \u201csharable\u201d media \u2013 media that is easily shared with others anywhere, that can be updated quickly and with which we can interact \u2013 but it\u2019s how people engage with the blog that determines whether it is also \u201csocial\" media.\n\nNevertheless, the next wave is here. Social networks and social\nmedia are disappearing into the fabric of the Web. The promise of Compuserve\nand \u201cWeb 1.0\u201d sites is here.\n\nAnd as for what comes next? Well, that responsibility now appears\nto lie with us.\n\nThis entry was posted in Popular Culture, PR & Marketing, Technology.

Interesting prediction, Gary.\n    I wonder if you could make a parallel to how civilization grew to how the WWW has evolved: clans\/tribes, then villages, towns, cities, connected regions, countries, etc. All growing and interacting via bridges (or, rather roads and modes of transportation). But, as you describe, the modes will be digital.\n    It\u2019s almost human nature to *want* to come together in larger communities (that sense of belonging).\n    A blog from the U of Maryland had a fascinating post that sort of echoes your comments.

        "text":"\u00ab IPCop Part II - Cop+ and DansGuardianRandomSupport.com Domain \u00bb\n\n\n\nPermalink 09:55:00 pm by guy, Categories: IPCop\n\nHave you heard of IPCop? Neither had I until 6 months ago. I was looking for a solution (I was thinking internet content filtering software) that I could install on my kid\u2019s PCs that would protect them from the \u201cNaughty Sites\u201d that are soooo easy to stumble upon out in the wild internet. My kids are too young to find them on purpose, I just don\u2019t want to have my daughters researching \u201cDallas\u201d for a geography report and have them finding \u201cDebbie Does\u2026\u201d I watch the kids VERY closely and I\u2019m actually usually right there with them, but I can\u2019t ALWAYS be! I eventually stumbled upon IPCop and found that with some simple addons I could block the bad stuff at the gate for ALL my home network\u2019s computers and do it without installing software on the individual computers!\n\nAll that, and it is free and open source software!\n\nFollow up:\n\nDo you have a firewall on your PC or your home network? Of course you do! Right?!? Even those of you who would answer \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d could probably answer yes if you checked with your local techie neighbor. It seems like pretty much every home network with high speed internet these days has a router\/firewall\/access point attached to the cable modem or DSL modem, that is a good thing. I would guess that this is generally installed more for the purpose of setting up a wireless network than for the firewall, but most people have it whether they know it or not in the form of their wireless access point.\n\nI digress, this isn\u2019t about firewalls. Well, not exactly\u2026 actually it is, but it isn\u2019t what gets me all excited (perhaps I am easily excited). Let\u2019s get back on track, IPCop, what is it?\n\nIPCop is a Free Linux distribution (don\u2019t be scared, it won\u2019t hurt you!) that has been pared down to the absolute minimum required to allow you to convert an old PC that you thought was worthless into an industrial strength firewall for your home or office.\n\nHere is some of the core functionality included \u201cout of the box\". The items in bold represent functionality you wouldn\u2019t expect out of your typical off the shelf home firewall (Linksys, D-Link, etc):\n\n  \u2022 DHCP Server\n  \u2022 SNORT Network Intrusion Detection\n  \u2022 DHCP client \/ server\n  \u2022 Dynamic DNS\n  \u2022 HTTP \/ FTP proxy (SQUID) - Reduces bandwidth and improves response times by locally caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages\n  \u2022 Log local or remote\n  \u2022 NTP client \/ server\n  \u2022 SSH server (PSK or password)\n  \u2022 Traffic shaping (red interface)\n  \u2022 System memory, cpu, and disk access graphs by day, week, year\n  \u2022 Bandwidth graphs by interface (Green, Red, etc.)\n\nIt also has the ability to be modified with PlugIns to enable additional functionality. Once you install it on an old PC you have a Network Security Appliance that you can hook up directly between your internet connection (Cable Modem or DSL or whatever) and your home network. Bottom line, ALL traffic to and from the internet MUST go through IPCop. That means that you can use IPCop to control what passes and what doesn\u2019t. The basic functionality performs all the basic firewall functionality that you would have on your typical Linksys, Netgear, or whatever access point\/router you bought at best buy. \u201cCool, but why build a computer to do what I can get for $50?\u201d Well, for $50 you get a static device. With IPCop you can addon different tools and features. Examples:\n\n  \u2022 Dan\u2019s Guardian Content Filtering (Cop+) this alone makes this all worth it all to me!\n  \u2022 User authentication and auditing\n  \u2022 Bandwith Throttling\n  \u2022 Transparent Virus and Spam Filtering\n  \u2022 More and more\n\nWhat do you need to make this all work? The IPCop web site says this:\n\nIPCop runs on a dedicated box. It will run on old, or \u201cobsolete\u201d hardware, such as a 386 processor, 32Mb of RAM, and 300Mb hard disk. But if you plan on using some of IPCop\u2019s features, such as the caching web proxy, or Intrusion Detection Logging, you are going to need more RAM, more disk space, and a faster processor.\n\nA floppy disk is not required, but is useful for backing up and upgrading your system.\n\nA CDROM drive makes it easy to install IPCop, but again is not required if you know how to install over your network using HTTP.\n\nAt least one Network Interface Card NIC is required. User feedback suggests that you get what you pay for; so fitting a good quality 10\/100Mbps Ethernet card for the Green Interface is worth it. If you will be connecting to the Internet via a cable modem, you will need two NICs.\n\nI run IPCop with an 800mhz machine with 256meg of RAM and a 20gig drive. This appears to be more than enough for my home network even with Cop+ installed.\n\nThere is so much more to say about IPCop and what it does and is capable of doing. I\u2019m going to cut this introduction short here. I\u2019m planning to next blog specifically about the Content Filtering addon COP+ which adds Dan\u2019s Guardian to a standard IPCop installation.\n\nI know I didn\u2019t really get into the Cop+ addin that I am so obviously excited about. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be back with that followup along with a little Addon that I created for the Cop+ addon that allows you to easily create a password protected bypass of the content filter for users you would like to allow the privilege to.\n\nJanuary 2019\nSun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat\n\u00a0<<\u00a0< \u00a0 >\u00a0>>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 1 2 3 4 5\n6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16 17 18 19\n20 21 22 23 24 25 26\n27 28 29 30 31 \u00a0 \u00a0\nI'm a generalist, at least if I'm honest.

So when the Start Button was partially restored in Windows 8.1, yes, it was now easier to get to the Control Panel, Task Manager, and Shut Down, but, really, who cared?\n\nSometimes things nag at me, such as\u2026\u00a0 Installation programs still ask if I want to send a shortcut to the Start Menu.\u00a0 I say \u201cYes\u201d for old-time\u2019s sake and maybe because, in the same way young children believe in the tooth fairy, I had hopes that a real Start Button would magically appear. But, what was happening when I said \u201cYes\u201d?\u00a0 Did Windows simply ignore the instruction?\n\nFor reasons I\u2019m not sure, one day I decided to search for StartMenu\u2026and I found it!\n\nHere\u2019s how to create the Start Menu on the Desktop!\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right click on Start Button. \u00a0Choose File Explorer.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Click on View and then check the box that shows Hidden Items\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Click on drive C:, then Program Data (not Files!)\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Click on Microsoft, then Windows, then Start Menu\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RIGHT-CLICK on Programs and Send to: Desktop.\n\nAll done!\u00a0 You might want to move the Shortcut to the lower left hand corner next to the Start Button and change the icon to something distinctive.\n\nThursday, January 16, 2014\n\nmicro SD cards: exFAT to NTFS\n\nA form has two boxes so that respondents can enter \"Age in years\", which works fine until the 102 year old person comes along.\n\nThat's the idea behind different file systems. In the beginning, there was FAT16. As disks got larger, there were more files than FAT16 could handle, so FAT32 was invented. Disks got larger still. Welcome NTFS. But, wait! Microsoft doesn't own NTFS! So, there is also exFAT!\n\nI like to use the Everything Search Engine utility from Voidtools. It works only with NTFS disks. I just got an Asus T100TA Transformer Book with 64 GB of its own storage and a micro SD slot that can accommodate a 64 GB micro SD card. I got a 64 GB micro SD card, which came unformatted. However, when my computer asked if I wanted to format the card, the only choice I was given was exFAT.\n\nThe solution:\n\n  \u2022 Attach unformatted card to computer.\n  \u2022 Go to Device Manager. (Win-Pause\/Break followed by clicking on Hardware, is one way to get there.)\n  \u2022 Right click on SD card. Choose Properties.\n  \u2022 Policies tab. Choose Optimize for Performance.\n  \u2022 Go to the Command prompt. Assuming Z is the drive letter (but be sure you get it right or disaster could strike!), type\n    format Z: \/fs:NTFS\n\nThis helped me better understand when and why one has to be careful removing USB drives.\n\nDrives can be set up two ways:\n\n  \u2022 Optimize for Quick Removal: This setting disables write caching on the disk and in Windows, so you can disconnect the device safely without using the Safely Remove Hardware notification icon.\n  \u2022 Optimize for Performance: This setting enables write caching in Windows to improve disk performance. To disconnect this device from the computer, click the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the taskbar notification area.\n\nNTFS is optimized for performance. exFAT is optimized for quick removal. While no drives should ever be removed while an operation is in progress, it's easier to be sure there's nothing waiting in the wings if a drive is optimized for quick removal. Since I expect to rarely be removing this card from the tablet, the advantages the NTFS system provide more than outweigh the convenience of quick removal.\n\nWindows 8 tablet?!?!?!\n\nI do all of my computing on Windows machines, if you don't count Android smart phones and tablets. I have a bunch of Android tablets, mostly as a result of my search for just the right device to hold and display 1,000+ PDFs of song lyrics. I often wished there were one device that could do it all.\n\nThere have been Windows tablets, but they suffered from two serious handicaps. The first was price. The early ones cost more than $1,000, which I could never justify for just another tablet. The second is Windows itself. (Note the intentionally careful use of \"was\" and \"is\".)\n\nI'm writing this on an Asus T100TA Transformer Book--a full Windows 8.1...well, you tell me. Is is a 10.1\" tablet with a docking station or a 10.1\" computer whose screen separates from its keyboard? Regardless, the whole package--with 2 GB of memory, 64 GB storage and a micro SD slot that accommodates cards of up to 64GB and a licensed copy of Microsoft Office Home and Student Edition--went for $399 at both Best Buy and the Microsoft Store.\n\nAs a computer, it feels just like a 10\" netbook with chicklet keyboard. I really like it, but I really like netbooks. Nice screen. Anyone who cares can look up the epecs. Windows 8 gets a well-deserved bad rap, but it can be made to function a lot like Windows 7 for ordinary tasks.\n\nAs a tablet...at the moment it suffers from Windows 8.1. It works smoothly enough, but the variety of available apps is nothing like what's available for iOS or Android. A nice file manager would be welcomed.\n\nStill, it's a nice device overall and has become my new default go-to computer when I don't need a desktop. Updates will follow if anything changes.\n\nLast But Not Least Department: It comes with a 32 bit version of Windows 8.1!!! I'd heard rumors that such a thing existed, but never thought I'd actually get my hands on one! Most people won't know what I'm talking about, or care. Some will find this a real turn off. It means that the device cannot run 64 bit programs, which are the \"wave of the future\"...just as they've bee for a long time now. But, it can run old legacy programs, of which I've many, that won't run under 64 bit Windows! For those who really care, the processor is 64 bit, so presumably a 64 bit version of Windows could be installed if one were hell bent, determined, and wanted to undergo the expense.\n\nMonday, January 13, 2014\n\nBackup and Sync...months later\n\nI went back to have another look at the synchronization services I reviewed last year. I felt overwhelmed! Everything has a more polished look. Each service has its own fans. Maybe there's now one among them that would put all of the others to shame. I don't know. I've found a system that works for me, so I now leave the task of further reviewing to others. I'd love to read it, but not to do the basic research myself.\n\nAs of the moment, there are three services I find worth considering.\n\n  \u2022 The first, no surprise, is Dropbox. It's the service that defined the category. It seems to work almost flawlessly. It not only synchronizes files across devices but also backs them on line, to be there should disaster strike.\n\n    It has a few shortcomings, however.\n\n    \u2022 Everything has to go into a single Dropbox folder.\n    \u2022 The Android app. Because Android devices often have limited storage, the Android Dropbox app behaves differently from the desktop program.\n      \u2022 With the desktop program, all files are automatically synchronized across all computers.\n      \u2022 With the Android app, the names of files and folders are synchronized automatically, but files are not downloaded automatically, to avoid taking up all available space.\n      There is an option to designate favorite files that do get updated automatically. However, unless things have changed, there's no way to update the contents of a folder automatically. There is an Androd app, DropSync, that adds this feature, but it is not part of Dropbox, itself.\n\nThe other two services I like allow users to designate as many folders as they wish for synchronization. Different folders can be synchronized across different sets of devices. My work files might get synchronized across all of my devices while my personal files never appear on any computer owned by my employer.\n\n  \u2022 Cubby allows any folder to identified as a Cubby. Think of each Cubby as its own Dropbox. You can have as many as you want and synchronize each Cubby over as few of many devices as you choose. Data are backed up on the company's servers. A paid account includes Direct Sync to synchronize as many Cubbies as one wants without having the data backed up online. Direct Sync protects privacy and has no size limits. The annoying thing about Cubby is that it is constantly using 3 to 6% of the CPU when it should be idle. Others have reported higher numbers. I imagine some polling is necessary, but I don't see anything like this with other services.\n  \u2022 BitTorrent Sync (BTSync) is like Cubby's Direct Sync. Any folders can be designated for synchronization on as few or many devices as one wishes. There is also a Read Only option, so that changes made on that device are not reflected on other devices. I use this for folders of song lyrics on my tablets to guard against accidental erasures. BTSync is free. The downside is that there is no option for online storage, so you need your own disaster plan. Mine is an automatic weekly (soon to be daily) back of my desktop computer.\n\nRight now,\n\n  \u2022 I use Dropbox for sensitive files where I want the security of online backup copies.\n  \u2022 I use BTSync for everything else.\n  \u2022 I'm not using Cubby at the moment due to what appears to be an excessive use of resources. However, its ability to make any folder a Cubby and provide online backup keeps me from crossing it off of my list entirely.\nI'm not arguing that this is what everyone should.

        "text":"Thursday, November 15, 2012\n\nThe Free Domain Registration Service \"\" Appears To Be Down\n\nSome Blogger blog owners, trying to save a few dollars while publishing their blogs to a non BlogSpot URL, have used the free service \"\" for registering their domains.\n\nAs \"\" increased its base of \"customers\", their reputation for providing free registration grew - and they became popular with scammers and spammers.\n\nLast year, Google, weary of the overall poor search engine reputation of customers, de indexed all websites registered by This week, apparently stopped serving DNS information for its \"customer domains\".\n\nStrictly speaking, \"\" was not a registrar - and the blogs and websites published by its customers were not using registered domains.\n\nThe \"Top Level domain\" - which by its name implied an Internet service operating from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands - was in fact the domain \"co\", operating out of Korea, and registered in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. All \"domains\" given out by \"\" were in fact sub domains to the domain - and this is where the problem started.\n\nAll blogs and websites, published to a \"\" subdomain, were aggregated by the search engines as the \"\" domain. As the number of registered scammy and spammy websites increased, their search engine reputation dropped. Non spammy blogs and websites either went out of business, or were transferred to legally registered domains, because of the low reputation and lower search engine originated traffic.\n\nFinally, the owners of - supposedly \"JONG SUNG, KIM\" of \"GOYANG,GYEOUNGGI\" - realised that their run was over, and that they could no longer hide their scams and spams behind legitimate blogs and websites. Apparently, they have now shut their doors.\n\nThe old adage comes to mind.\nYou don't get something for nothing.\n\nIf you registered your custom domain using - and your blog is now offline - you're going to have to publish the blog back to BlogSpot, to get it online again. If you want to use a domain URL, you have to repeat the custom domain setup process - starting with a new, properly paid for, domain URL.\n(Update 2015\/02): We now have more of the same, from \"\".\n\nDude, hit me with a comment!\n\nJan said...\n\nHey I don't think they actually shut it down. It was too profitable a business, little overheard. I read that their domain was closed down by the feds over all the abuse of the domains for phishing and scams.\n\nThey lost the domains all together!",

Contribution on-ramps, peer-to-peer celebration, clear explanations of our new initiatives, and telling the world about our history and mission were my primary goals.\n\nMy secondary goal was to make our Product Support channels more visible, and to answer as many messages with relevant links into the Support systems as possible.\u00a0 People who came looking for technical solutions, became people who liked our stories and shared our messages.\n\nOn Facebook I found active Mozillian voices in communities as diverse as Thailand, Ireland, and Romania, and also many \u2018tech-curious\u2019 individuals across the globe.\u00a0I listened to the community and learned to create stories and content that celebrated their interests, as well as showing how our work impacted them in multiple ways.\n\nThere were many strategic concerns \u2013\u00a0ranging from\u00a0using a simpler writing style, with simpler phrasing, word choices and less technical jargon (because until the channel content could be fully translated and localized, most messaging would default through Facebook\u2019s comment translation tools) to ensuring I kept up to date with multiple platform changes (which both offered me greater control in geo-targeted messaging, but also constantly complicated metrics analysis with every update).\n\nBuilding community, attracting discussion and opportunities for learning and educating abounds on Facebook.

        "text":"Monday, January 26, 2009\n\nTalkin' Twitter\n\nLet's take a moment here and talk about Twitter (follow me). Some folks are crazy for Twitter, while others wonder what all the rage is about. Personally, I've been having kind of a hard time describing it to others. Still, I like it a lot, and think that it will - in some form or another - be the future of blogging. I think that most of us are still figuring out just how to utilize their medium. My buddy Adrian from ipickmynose criticizes those who use the site simply for linking back to their blog. He twittered:\nhonestly, if I want to know when you post, I'll put your blog into my RSS reader, not follow you on twitter. Fast track to unfollowing.\nI have to say that I'm inclined to agree with him.\n\nA number of musicians are jumping into the Twitter game, and Drowned in Sound has done a great job of deciding whose worth following - and who isn't. A few of the artists I started following recently - Colin Meloy, Q-Tip, Janelle Monae, and, oh, MC Hammer.\n\nTwitter can be a great promotional tool - I think we still need to figure out just how it can be more than \"Eating a sandwich\" or \"Taking a Walk.\" Stephen Saber writes that Twitter will be a part of the future in some form, even if it is eventually called by another name:\nI postulate that he problem that people have with Twitter is that they are looking at it as if it is the final product of the communications revolution that it has started. Instead, let me suggest that you think of it as the AOL of its era. When AOL launched, it was very much a tool for social purposes that had a lot of features and functionality that could be repurposed for successful business uses. These days, AOL is all but non-existent in the realm of internet powerhouses, yet much of what was embedded in that application lives on today in many of the tools that we all rely on every day.\nA recent Wired commentary pretty much declared blogging dead - and it is true that the 'sphere has become quite cluttered. Twitter's short-form blogging is exciting and I am trying to utilize it for the things I don't always get to do on my blog. A fun challenge: Trying to compose a 140-word movie review.\n\nOh, and follow me.\n\n1 comment:\n\nAllison said...\n\nI can't remember what came first - the Facebook status updates, or Twitter? I have a twitter account, but never use it because I can't link it back to my blog, and hardly anyone I know uses Twitter.\n\nBut you're right about status updates in general becoming the wave of the future. I quite enjoyed your review of Revolutionary Road today. ;)",

That's a shame but totally understandable, so what are you going to do about it?\n\nWell the lovely folks over at Adobe have released a free online version that is really really cool. Its free to register your own account and start uploading photographs to edit. Now anyone can rotate, crop or tweak photos until the cows come home... or at least until you come home from holidays!\n\nYou get a generous 2Gb of space to upload your images. You also can import any images you've got stored on other sites like Flickr or Picasa. To add to these neat features is the ability to have your own public photo galleries. Now those happy photo snaps can be seen by friends and family before you get home.\n\nCheck out the link to Adobe Photoshop Express below. I hope you enjoyed the Momentz photo tip of the day.

        "text":"Studying the impact of innovation on business and society\n\nTop Twitter Trends of 2009\n\nNow that Twitter employs a Chief Scientist, we will benefit from the ongoing interpretation and publishing of Twitter behavior and activity to better understand how Twitter is constantly evolving.\n\nIn a discussion with Robert Scoble recently, I suggested that Twitter also consider hiring a digital anthropologist or sociologist, to not only analyze and comprehend data, but also effectively observe cultures and shifts within this burgeoning online society in order to participate in and ultimately shape its transformation.\n\nAs shared in Twitter\u2019s post announcing this year\u2019s top trends:\n\nTwitter\u2019s Trending Topics helped us understand what was happening around the world showing us that people everywhere can be united in concern around important events; excited about a new movie; or geek-out about a major new technology.\n\nTwitter is indeed a human seismograph, a reflection of current events as well as a real-time indicator of our focus and attention. Whether we agree or align with Twitter\u2019s trending topics, they do in fact represent popular interest at any given time. In 2009, Twitter\u2019s data concentrated on one particular topic that also demonstrated how diversified cultures, societies, beliefs, and politics can converge into one global community.\n\nAmong all the keywords, hashtags, and phrases that proliferated throughout the year, one topic surfaced repeatedly. Twitter users found the Iranian elections the most engaging topic of the year. The terms #iranelection, Iran and Tehran were all in the top-21 of Trending Topics, and #iranelection finished in a close second behind the regular weekly favorite #musicmonday.\n\nIf for but a moment, through services such as Twitter, we become one\u2026\n\nAs a seismograph detects and records the intensity, direction, and duration of a movement, Twitter captures the activity and reaction of people around events as they happen. In practically every instance, a spark triggered a social tsunami of tweets and retweets that echoed into history books of socialized media.\n\nTwitter Trends of 2009\n\nNews Events\n\n1. #iranelection\n2.

I think there are a few problems for relying on twitter as a seismograph and I'm curious to hear your thoughts.\n\n    1) there are just around 60 million users and traffic appears to be stagnant\n    granted 3rd party app traffic is way up:\n\n    2) the majority of twitter users are still in the US and thus perhaps not an accurate reflection of global trends\n\n    3) many trending topics are actually manipulated and gamed by contests, offers, promotions i.e. moonfruit, that don't necessarily reflect what people care about on a cultural, sociological, or a world level.\n\n    4) Twitter now has a reputation as a place to go to for political\/global protests\n\n    I'm not saying that I don't think the twitter information is valuable but I just don't know how accurately it reflects the pulse of the world. I have a psychology background as well so I'm always skeptical with general overviews and statistics as I have found plenty of flaws. It would be more valuable to breakdown the trends by geographic area\/location\/demographics\/psychographics and compare that against something such as facebook for example. I'm assuming that's what the digital anthropologist can do. The information from twitter is relative and the topics are only valuable when compared against other topics.\n\n    \u2022 briansolis says:\n\n      Even more interesting is that it's not 60 million users\u2026it's visitors (users are much less). However, it's not a reflection of mobile and third-party app usage. As someone interested in psychology, Twitter represents an interesting and perhaps, unique sampling that represents interests of people, most likely similar to you, me and people we know, all over the world. I just compared Facebook topics to Twitter topics in a post on 12\/30\u2026however, I'm also about to analyze different twitter trending data where the results are radically different.\n\n    \u2022 jacobmorgan says:\n\n      Yep I definitely agree with you on that. Curious to see the upcoming posts on the data you're looking at. I suppose the next question is what do you do with the data or the trends? Is it something you believe will be actionable for businesses or is this more of a societal and cultural thing? Might also be interesting to see how something on goole trends matches up with trends on facebook\/twitter. See you at CES!\n\n  2. edward04 says:\n\n    Interesting stuff. What strikes me from this is that Twitter still has an American bias, despite stuff on Susan Boyle and Iran. The spreading to other countries will make this an interesting analysis \u2013 to what extent global tools are used differently by differnt cultures. Globalisation as originally conceived \u2013 reduce costs, essentially, replicate business models as much as possible \u2013 needs a rethink, esp. now USA is the world's largest debtor rather than the largest creditor. Chinese twitter stuff would be fascinating.\n\n  3. You are THE Social Media Guru!

        "text":"Google Testing Reader Subscriptions in Search Results\n\nToday I was working on building out a new site, which involved adding some functionality to a WordPress site that I started last night. I wanted to add breadcrumbs to the theme, so I remembered that Joost de Valk has the correct WordPress code for this on his site.\n\nI searched [yoast breadcrumbs code] and was returned this SERP \u2013\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s Going On?\n\nApparently, Google is testing showing you personalized results (through Search, Plus Your World) through your RSS\/Google Reader subscriptions. I see the same test when I search for my friend and peer [ross hudgens] because I am subscribed to his RSS feed as well \u2013\n\nNow What?\n\nIf this test becomes more than that, I think this shows the value of having people sign up to receive your updates via RSS. Even those RSS is dying, and most people are getting their updates through Twitter and social networks now, this is an interesting move for Google. I can\u2019t imagine that this one will be successful, but Google seems to be clasping at straws, trying to get personalized results into your SERPs. I think Google+ is eventually the goal for this, but it\u2019s not used enough so now Google is asking themselves \u201cWell, what now?\u201d\n\nSo have people sign up to your RSS feed by making a clear call-to-action. Here\u2019s mine:\n\nIf it\u2019s your first or second visit, you\u2019ll see a different call to action for just the RSS feed.\n\nPersonally I wonder if Google would ever give us stats on how these changes affect click-through rates. I\u2019d love it if Google would show something similar to what they show for author stats, but I don\u2019t think they want us knowing how these different factors help or hurt our sites.\n\nHave you seen this test? Think it\u2019ll stick around?\n\nOne thought on \u201cGoogle Testing Reader Subscriptions in Search Results\n\n  1.
