        "text":"Do The Evolution?\n\nShould You Take Your Kids To See \u2018Ice Age: Collision Course\u2019?\n\nIce Age: Collision Course is the fifth installment of the series about pre-historic animal pals working together to survive natural disasters. This time the threat isn\u2019t global climate change (boring!), but an asteroid hurtling towards Earth. Will the cuddly animals\u00a0survive? That depends on whether\u00a0you think\u00a0a kids\u2019 movie would end in a fiery apocalypse. Once again\u00a0Ray Romano, Jennifer Lopez, John Leguizamo, Queen Latifah, and Denis Leary lend their voices, as well as\u00a0Workaholic\u2018s Adam DeVine. Here\u2019s\u00a0what the critics are saying to help you decide whether you should go see it, or if natural selection will win out at the box office.\n\nFor Kids:\u00a0The animation is probably the best of the series, and most critics think kids will be entertained enough. But don\u2019t expect them to be wowed. \u201cYoung children will enjoy the helter-skelter action and animation but the charm has gone,\u201d says Henry Fitzherbert of the Daily Express (UK). Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian advises you to just wait for it to land on Netflix, writing \u201cThis could provide some small-screen entertainment for bored kids on a rainy day. But really: Enough.\u201d The\u00a0animals in Ice Age didn\u2019t make it out of the prehistoric era, and even as a kiddie flick, critics seem to think the series shouldn\u2019t have made it out of the aughts.\n\nIce Age: Collision Course\n\nFor You:\u00a0Pixar, this ain\u2019t. These days, animated films have to work on multiple age levels and\u00a0critics say Ice Age is no longer cutting it. \u201cYes, there\u2019s visual spectacle, but the film is too predictable and mechanic. And not just adults will find it that way,\u201d says Diego Battle of La Nacion (Argentina). Stephen Romei of The Australian praises the animation and says \u201cthere\u2019s room for an interesting discussion with younger viewers if you know a bit about, well, the solar system,\u201d but adds that \u201cit\u2019s light on jokes for the adult viewer and the plot is a bit thin.\u201d Even one of the most positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes was kind of a neg. Eddie Harrison of The List writes, \u201cCollision Course is a brisk, innocuous entry in a series that places silliness and colour before narrative drive, character or originality.\u201d\n\nCommon Sense\u2019s Take: Common Sense Media, the leading nonprofit source for helping parents make movie and TV choices for kids, gives Ice Age: Collision Course a solid mehhhhh, fine. They praise the\u00a0teamwork theme and the \u201cunconditional love\/acceptance of the right \u2018herd,\u2019\u201d but note that it\u2019s no surprise things start to feel repetitive. They also caution parents of kids interested in space and prehistoric animals that the science in the film isn\u2019t exactly sound.\u00a0Yes, you\u00a0might have to\u00a0sit your kids down and tell them that\u00a0sabertooth tigers sounded nothing like Denis Leary.\n\nIce Age: Collision Course\n\nBottom Line:\u00a0Critics are bored by\u00a0Collision Course and the\u00a0formulaic plots of the Ice Age movies in general. \u00a0But, at\u00a0least 80 percent have also made an\u00a0extinction joke in their review, so who is formulaic now?\u00a0As Mike Zorilla writes for Blog de cine, Ice Age: Collision Course is \u201cthe lowest point of a franchise that wasn\u2019t even that good to begin with.\u201d In 2016, you and your kids can and should expect better from your animated features. If you really want to see\u00a0Ray Romano be great in something terrible, go watch a few episodes of\u00a0Vinyl.\n\nRating: PG (for mild rude humor and some action\/peril)\nRunning Time: 100 minutes\nAges: 6+",

        "text":"Apple assesment over the past decade\n\nWalt Mossberg, the renowned and highly respected technology columnist for the Wall St. Journal and The Verge, briefly came out of retirement to write an insightful analysis of the past decade of Apple with Tim Cook at the helm. It was a fascinating take \u2013 well balanced, knowledgeable, and perceptive, especially considering how supportive his views have been about Apple under Steve Jobs. It\u2019s well worth reading here\u00a0on The Verge.\n\nApple has always been of interest to those that love tech hardware such as myself, because it\u2019s been the world leader and has raised the level of hardware design and innovation for appearance, quality and ease of use. Apple\u2019s products in the late 90s set the standard for mechanical fit and finish that was picked up by its competitors and significantly raised the standards of the public\u2019s expectations.\n\nBut with Jobs departure due to his illness and death, things have not gone so well and, In that context I want to add to Mossberg\u2019s analysis and expand on several points he wrote relating to Cook\u2019s impact on Apple\u2019s products:\n\nBut Cook does bear the responsibility for a series of actions that screwed up the Macintosh for years. The beloved mainstream MacBook Air was ignored for five years. At the other end of the scale, the Mac Pro, the mainstay of professional audio, graphics, and video producers, was first neglected then reissued in 2013 in a way that put form so far ahead of function that it enraged its customer base.\n\nSome insiders think Cook allowed Ive\u2019s design team far too much power and that the balance Jobs was able to strike between the designers and the engineers was gone, at least until Ive left the company earlier this year.\n\nThe design-first culture that took root under Cook struck again with the MacBook Pro, yielding new laptops so thin their keyboards were awful and featuring USB-C ports that required sleek Macs to be used with ugly dongles. Apple has only recently retreated back to decent keyboards on the latest MacBook Pro, and it issued a much more promising Mac Pro. But dongles are still a part of the Apple experience across its product lines.\n\nOver the past decade I\u2019ve observed much the same, and have written about it here and on other sites. As someone that\u2019s developed and reviewed products professionally for many decades, I\u2019ve cringed to see so many unforced errors. Finding and criticizing was not fun, but Apple brought it on by the expectations they set, amplified by often over-the-top PR. It was the company that led the way in creating some of the best tech products in the world that so many loved. So when they faltered some were eager to criticize, while others, as myself, wanted to point out their mistakes in the hope of fixing them.\n\nOnce Cook took over, Apple made mistakes relating to its products frequent enough to wonder what was going on and what were they thinking. Some of the reasons have become more apparent in recent months as inside information leaked out.\n\nThe first product CEO Cook personally announced, Apple Maps, turned out to be a total embarrassment. \u00a0After personally praising the product as he personally introduced it, it immediately became apparent that Cook had never used the product, because most of us experienced embarrassing navigation issues. I remember how it directed me in the wrong direction to a restaurant in San Francisco, miles away from the correct location, Heads rolled as a result and Cook had to apologize.\n\nWe then saw a succession of bad hardware decisions over the years.\n\n  \u2022 Removing useful ports from computer notebooks and phones and replacing them with dozens of optional dongles. While Apple said this was necessary because of size constraints, most of the Windows notebooks managed to be as thin and light as the new MacBooks, while retaining all of the ports.\n  \u2022 Using smaller batteries than competitors use in their iPhones, making it difficult to get through the day and causing sudden shutdowns to the phone as the batteries aged. While most wanted longer battery life, Apple opted for thinness.\n  \u2022 Bendgate, the situation where many iPhones began bending in the pocket because the product was so thin.\n  \u2022 Replacing the well-sproven, reliable keyboard with the unreliable butterfly version to make the MacBooks a bit thinner. That led to five years of recalls and repairs and notebooks without a dependable keyboard.\n  \u2022 Designing Apple MacBooks so they were impossible to repair or replace defective parts. The subassemblies were all glued together and the products became throwaways. iFixit\u2019s repair ratings for MacBooks plummeted to a 1 out of 10, where 10 was easily repairable.\n\nThese were all decisions that were made for aesthetics and not for function. It was what became known Apple\u2019s obsession with thinness.\n\nAs Walt noted, Jony Ive, the head of design, who worked closely with Jobs, was now untethered. He became Apple\u2019s new product visionary and he ran wild. Cook ceded product responsibility to Ive.\n\nThe results would have been catastrophic for most companies, but Apple had so much goodwill and its products were generally so much better than competitors, that Ive\u2019s impact was less visible for a long time, aided by Apple\u2019s PR machine lauding every new design tweak, from the \u201cspecial aluminium\u201d to the \u201camazing new crown\u201d on the watch .\n\nNow, a decade later after this transition, the evidence is clear. Apple has squandered their advantage and has created products that have greatly diminished its leadership in the notebook arena and has saddled its iPhone users with a myriad of problems because of an obsession with thinness.\n\nWith Ive just recently departing, we\u2019ve seen the first MacBook in five years with a reliable keyboard, the MacBook 16\u2033. Fans are hoping it\u2019s the harbinger of a wave of new notebooks that will solve the keyboard issue on all models.\n\nWhat I remember about the last decade is that Apple entered it with the most innovative, beautiful, and well-designed products ever, and is leaving the decade with line of unreliable notebooks and underpowered phones, both just now being addressed.\n\nIn other areas Apple has had better success. It tool Apple three years to fix a lot of Watch problems, but now that it\u2019s in its 3rd incarnation, its an excellent product with no serious competition. \u00a0Apple has also had a big success with its Earpods accessory headphones.\n\nThe next big announcement for Apple is this Spring and many are hoping for a new line of notebooks with keyboards that finally work.\n\n\n\n\n\nby Phil Baker",

With a kaleidoscopic array of action, emotion and urgent human connections that light points along an infinite timeline, it suggests that individual lives continue their personal trajectories through the ages. Souls, reborn, renew their bonds with one another, time and again. Mistakes can be rectified or repeated. Freedom can be gained or lost, but is forever sought.\n\nThe film consists of six interrelated and interwoven stories that take the viewer from the South Pacific in the 19th century to a distant, post-apocalyptic future.\n\n\"It is a cinematic journey for which audiences are starving,\" said Tykwer. \"There is an audience that is undernourished and wants to be fed. They love to soak up and think, and have a full dinner just about what you've just seen and then take it to bed and wake up in the morning, still thinking about it. That's how we fell in love with cinema. We cannot be alone because we meet those people all the time.\"\n\nCloud Atlas was made on a budget of more than USD100 million, a portion of which was furnished by Warner Bros., but most of which was raised independently, which has led some to call it \"the most expensive indie film of all time\".\n\nMost expensive German-produced film to date\n\nCloud Atlas is considered to be \"the first attempt at a German blockbuster\" with its budget making it the most expensive German-produced film to date.\n\nIt features a stellar cast: Academy Award winners Tom Hanks (Philadelphia, Forrest Gump) and Halle Berry (Monster's Ball) lead an international cast that also includes Oscar-winner Jim Broadbent (Iris), Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Xun Zhou, Keith David and David Gyasi, Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking) and Hugh Grant. Each member of the ensemble appears in multiple roles as the story moves through time.\n\nTom Tykwer and the Wachowskis filmed parallel to each other using separate camera crews. The Wachowskis directed the 19th-century story and the two set in the future, while Tykwer directed the stories set in the 1930s, the 70s, and the present day.\n\nUnlike the original novel, the film is structured, according to novelist David Mitchell, \"as a sort of pointillist mosaic: We stay in each of the six worlds just long enough for the hook to be sunk in and from then on the film darts from world to world at the speed of a plate spinner, revisiting each narrative for long enough to propel it forward. (Pointillism is the technique of painting elaborated from impressionism.)\n\nThe epic journey\n\nHere's an outline that sums up the epic journey and six stories (without revealing the secrets that guarantee to blow your mind).\n\u2022 Pacific Ocean, circa 1849: The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing Adam Ewing, (Jim Sturgess) an American lawyer from San Francisco during the California Gold Rush, has come to the Chatham Islands to conclude a business arrangement for his father-in-law. He meets Dr Henry Goose (Tom Hanks) who offers a cure for the parasitic worm that is seemingly eating his brain. While ashore, Adam learns about the enslavement of the Moriori tribe and observes a slave being whipped. The slave, Autua (David Gyasi), stows away on the ship and Adam reluctantly keeps him hidden.\n\u2022 Edinburgh, Scotland, 1936: Letters from Zedelghem Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw), a penniless young English musician, finds work as an amanuensis to a famous composer, allowing Frobisher the time and inspiration to compose his own masterpiece, The Cloud Atlas Sextet.\n\u2022 San Francisco, California, 1975: Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery Luisa Rey (Halle Berry), is a journalist, sent to write a story about a new nuclear power plant. She meets Sixsmith (James D'Arcy), a respected nuclear physicist who decides to help Rey expose a conspiracy regarding the safety of a nuclear reactor.\n\u2022 United Kingdom, 2012: The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish. Timothy Cavendish, (Jim Broadbent) a 65-year-old publisher, flees the associates of a jailed gangster author and ends up confined against his will in a nursing home from which he attempts to escape.\n\u2022 Neo Seoul (Korea), 22nd century: An Orison of Sonmi~451. Sonmi~451, a genetically-engineered fabricant (clone) server at a fast-food restaurant (Bae Doona ), rebels against the totalitarian society that created and exploited her kind.\n\u2022 On a beautiful ocean island on a distant post-apocalyptic Earth: Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After. A tribesman named Zachry (Tom Hanks) living a primitive life after most of humanity have died during \"The Fall\" is visited by Meronym (Halle Berry), a member of the last remnants of a technologically advanced civilisation and agrees to guide her into the mountains in search of Cloud Atlas.\n\nRead more about the film Cloud Atlas at\n\nAbout Daniel Dercksen\n\nAs a freelance film and theatre journalist for more than 30 years, published playwright and creator of the independent training initiative The Writing Studio, Daniel Dercksen received the number one spot for most popular lifestyle contributor for 2012, 2014 and 2015, and 2nd spot in 2016 on",

Had he lived and been vigorous enough to flog the book everywhere possible on the book hype tour, there is no question in my mind that this book would have been launched into serious American consciousness.\n\nWe\u2019d have seen him venerated on all the talk shows that matter and some that don\u2019t. He\u2019d have been on \u201cCBS Sunday Morning\u201d and who knows what else.\n\nIt\u2019s a milestone book--the final testament of a great American sensibility which was tragically orphaned by the author\u2019s mortality just before publication. It\u2019s a summing up and probably as welcome as any book Gregory ever wrote. He wasn\u2019t just the first black comedian of them all but a man who, for the rest of his life, was a tireless activist and, as he puts it \u201clet\u2019s not forget, conspiracy theorist.\u201d (Read him on Martin Luther King\u2019s assassination.).\n\nThe truth about Gregory is even at the beginning, humor was just his way of being a razor-sharp social critic. His contemporary in black comedy, Godfrey Cambridge, was funnier. But Gregory took his American \u201cotherness\u201d into something that, at times, almost seemed to bid for sainthood.\n\nSo this challenging, hugely readable book is the Gregory\u2019s--eye-view of Black America right up to \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and the film \u201cGet Out.\u201d The title word \u201cblack\u201d is struck out to get across that black history is American history. He wants us to know that Nat Turner\u2019s was not the only slave revolt and that Rosa Parks, when she wouldn\u2019t give up her bus seat, had Emmett Till on her mind.\n\nHe said he\u2019d place John Brown as Number One \u201cif I had to make out a list of the fifty most important people who ever lived in the history of planet Earth\u201d but that Abraham Lincoln \u201cdidn\u2019t care one way or the other about black folks.\u201d\n\nBoth Malcolm X and Richard Pryor, says Gregory, \u201chad something in common. They were both so bashful they\u2019d embarrass you. They\u2019d pull their heads down; couldn\u2019t look up at folks.\u201d A landmark American book whose author, tragically, didn\u2019t live to force us to admit it.\n\nEmail: jsimon@buffnews.com\n\nThere are no comments - be the first to comment",

        "text":"\n\n  \u2022 The current price multiples.\n  \u2022 The consistency of past earnings and cash flow.\n  \u2022 The amount of growth we can expect.\n\nLet's see what those numbers can tell us about how expensive or cheap DineEquity (NYSE: DIN) might be.\n\nThe current price multiples\nFirst, we'll look at most investors' favorite metric: the price-to-earnings ratio. It divides the company's share price by its earnings per share (EPS). The lower the P\/E, the better.\n\nThen we'll take things up a notch with a more advanced metric: enterprise value to unlevered free cash flow. This tool divides the company's enterprise value (basically, its market cap plus its debt, minus its cash) by its unlevered free cash flow (its free cash flow, adding back the interest payments on its debt). As with the P\/E, the lower this number is, the better.\n\nAnalysts argue about which is more important -- earnings or cash flow. Who cares? A good buy ideally has low multiples on both.\n\nDineEquity has a P\/E ratio of 232.1 and an EV\/FCF ratio of 12.0 over the trailing 12 months. If we stretch and compare current valuations with the five-year averages for earnings and free cash flow, we see that DineEquity has a negative P\/E ratio and a five-year EV\/FCF ratio of 17.4.\n\nA one-year ratio of less than 10 for both metrics is ideal. For a five-year metric, less than 20 is ideal.\n\nDineEquity has a mixed performance in hitting the ideal targets, but let's see how it stacks up against some of its competitors and industry mates.\u00a0\n\n\n1-Year P\/E\n\n1-Year EV\/FCF\n\n5-Year P\/E\n\n5-Year EV\/FCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheesecake Factory (Nasdaq: CAKE)\n\n\n\n\n\nBrinker International (NYSE: EAT)\n\n\n\n\n\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store (Nasdaq: CBRL)\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Capital IQ, a division of Standard & Poor's; NM = not meaningful.\n\nNumerically, we've seen how DineEquity's valuation rates on both an absolute and relative basis. Next, let's examine \u2026\n\nThe consistency of past earnings and cash flow\nAn ideal company will be consistently strong in its earnings and cash-flow generation.\n\nIn the past five years, DineEquity's net income margin has ranged from -4.4% to 12.6%. In that same time frame, unlevered free cash flow margin has ranged from 14.0% to 22.4%.\n\nHow do those figures compare with those of the company's peers? See for yourself:\n\n\nSource: Capital IQ, a division of Standard & Poor's; margin ranges are combined.\n\nIn addition, over the past five years, DineEquity has tallied up three years of positive earnings and five years of positive free cash flow.\n\nNext, let's figure out \u2026\n\nHow much growth we can expect\nAnalysts tend to comically overstate their five-year growth estimates. If you accept them at face value, you will overpay for stocks. But even though you should definitely take the analysts' prognostications with a grain of salt, they can still provide a useful starting point when compared with similar numbers from a company's closest rivals.\n\nLet's start by seeing what this company's done over the past five years. Because of prior losses, DineEquity's EPS growth rate isn't meaningful. Meanwhile, Wall Street's analysts expect future growth rates of 14.0%.\n\nHere's how DineEquity compares with its peers for trailing five-year growth:\n\n\nSource: Capital IQ, a division of Standard & Poor's; EPS growth shown.\n\nAnd here's how it measures up with regard to the growth analysts expect over the next five years:\n\n\nSource: Capital IQ, a division of Standard & Poor's; estimates for EPS growth.\n\nThe bottom line\nThe pile of numbers we've plowed through has shown us how cheap shares of DineEquity\u00a0are trading, how consistent its performance has been, and what kind of growth profile it has -- both on an absolute and a relative basis.\n\nThe more consistent a company's performance has been and the more growth we can expect, the more we should be willing to pay. We've gone well beyond looking at a 232.1 P\/E ratio.\n\nI find the three comp companies more enticing than DineEquity and its Applebee's and International House of Pancakes brands. But that's just me.\n\nIf you find DineEquity's numbers compelling, don't stop here. Continue your due-diligence process until you're confident that the initial numbers aren't lying to you.\n\nInterested in reading more about any of these stocks?

But for that one shining moment, the 1968 Detroit Tigers were my world, and on that one night, September 17, 1968, they rallied late like they had all season to defeat the New York Yankees and win the American League pennant. It feels like it was just yesterday.\n\nThe call of the final out from legendary Tiger broadcaster Ernie Harwell went like this:\n\nThis big crowd here ready to break loose. Three men on, two men out. Game tied, 1-1, in the ninth inning. McDaniel checking his sign with Jake Gibbs. The tall right-hander ready to go to work again, and the windup, and the pitch\u2026He swings, a line shot, base hit, right field, the Tigers win it! Here comes Kaline to score and it\u2019s all over! Don Wert singles, the Tigers mob Don, Kaline has scored\u2026The fans are streaming on the field\u2026And the Tigers have won their first pennant since nineteen hundred and forty-five. Let\u2019s listen to the bedlam here at Tiger Stadium!\n\nListening on my clock radio in my bedroom, I had no one to high five or celebrate with, but my sister called me downstairs to watch the news, who had broken in with live shots from the Tiger clubhouse, and the tradition of pouring champagne over each other to celebrate became known to me.\n\nNow, special booths are set up to interview the players post championship, but what I love about this is the primitiveness of the broadcast, almost as a chaotic as the celebration itself. And this first video features 30 game winner Denny McLain, the last player to win 30 games in a single season.\n\nThis video features Hall of Famer Al Kaline, Dick Tracewski and Jim Northrup.\n\nThe last video features hitting coach Wally Moses getting hit in the face with some shaving cream which has entered the celebration.",

        "text":"Find us on Facebook\n\n\nBy Lourdes Cardenas\n(Courtesy of\u00a0 The El Paso Times)\n\n\nrickperryGovernor Rick Perry \u2018s statement supporting the idea of sending U.S. troops to help Mexico fight the drug cartels will create controversy on the other side of the border. It is ironic that Perry made that statement exactly one day before Mexicans will celebrate the centennial of the revolution that ended up the 26-year dictatorship of General Porfirio D\u00edaz.\n\nMexicans do not have good memories of U.S. interventions. You need only to mention the 1846-1848 U.S-Mexico War\u2013when Mexico lost a big part of its territory\u2013to provoke a complete rejection of any idea of American intervention.\n\nHistorically, Mexicans have not viewed American intervention as support for the people (el pueblo). When they have come into the country, Americans have supported the interests of private companies or they have backed politicians hated by the people.\n\nIn 1906, for example, when Porfirio Diaz was still in power, American troops came into the country to help the dictator to crush a miners\u2019 strike in Cananea, Sonora.\n\nThe mine, Cananea Consolidated Copper Company, was owned by William C. Greene, who asked for help from the government of Arizona. In response to his petition, the government sent a group of rangers to protect the company\u2019s facilities and to quell the unrest. In doing so, the rangers were actively involved in the killing of several of the rebel miners. \u00a0The Cananea strike is considered a precursor to the Revolution.\n\nEight years later, U.S. troops invaded again, this time to occupy Veracruz and to reject the government of Victoriano Huerta, which, by the way, came into power due to the assistance of the infamous US Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson. The U.S intervention in Veracruz lasted six months. And again, in 1916, U.S. troops were sent to Mexico to pursue Pancho Villa, who had dared to invade the US through Columbus, Nuevo Mexico. General Brigadier John J. Pershing was appointed by President Wilson to lead an army of 4,800 troops on a punitive expedition into Mexico.\u00a0 However, the mission failed.\n\nThe problems that Mexico is facing now are totally different from the ones that prevailed during the revolution, but the America\u2019s special interests in Mexico are as strong as they were during the 20th Century.\u00a0 Shared concerns such as immigration, border security, trade, investment, flow of capital, among others, could explain Perry\u2019s suggestion about sending troops to Mexico. Mexicans are very concerned about the violence of the drug war and they want a solution to the problem, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they support a foreign intervention of troops, although they would support more American involvement in terms of training and financial help.\n\nLast August, the Pew Research Center released a survey that showed that 78 percent of Mexicans favor the US providing training to Mexican police and military personnel.\n\n\u201cA smaller majority (57%) favors the U.S. providing money and weapons to Mexican police and military personnel, down slightly from 63% last year\u2026 Opposition to the deployment of U.S. troops in Mexico has also increased from an already high 59% last year to 67% in the current survey.\u201d\n\nThe Pew survey also showed that the support for American assistance to Mexican forces tends to be strongest in northern Mexico, where the violence has affected people more directly and dramatically. Mexico and the US have been working together to fight drug trafficking because this is a problem that concerns and affects both countries. As we know, through the Merida Initiative the US is helping Mexico with over $1.3 billion for police professionalization, judicial and prison reform, border security, intelligence and many other issues.\n\nFurthermore, according to Mexican magazine Proceso, the US has already established a bi-national center of intelligence in Mexico, from where agents from the CIA, DEA, ATF and the Pentagon are already investigating drug trafficking organizations and organized crime.\n\nIf the US is already helping Mexico and getting involved in the drug war \u2013through training, research, intelligence and resources\u2013why would Perry voice such an absurd idea?\n\n(Ed. Note: Governor Perry is famous for making fatuous statements, viz. his call for Texas to secede from the Union. This is more than stupid, it is deeply offensive. Perry seems to have forgotten a war in which hundreds of thousands of brave Americans fought and died over this very issue. Perry also seems to have overlooked the fact that if such a secession came to pass, all federal military installations and financial assistance would quickly vanish, causing Texas to immediately thereafter declare bankruptcy. This all makes me wonder how my beloved home-state of Texas can elect such mentally-challenged politicians.

Chavis, Jr.\/NNPA Columnist\nOn December 8, 2014\n\nLatinos share the same issues with Blacks on racial equality and economic empowerment and need our support.\nCredit: Pete Souza\/White House\n\nAs I watched President Barack Obama address the nation on his \u201ccontroversial\u201d Executive Order on immigration reform, I was reminded of the evening of April 4, 1967. I was inside Riverside Church in New York City when the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his courageous sermon in opposition to the Vietnam War. Even some of his supporters questioned his theological audacity to link civil rights injustice in the United States to human rights injustice in Vietnam.\n\nDecades later, history has proven King to have been right in his opposition. What will history say 50 years from now about President Obama\u2019s leadership on immigration and his determination to fix the system?\n\nLeadership is about speaking out against injustice. It is also about taking action to correct injustice. Civil rights leadership, as exemplified by King, was audacious with the courage to take action to challenge injustice in a manner that inspired millions of people to join the cause. In his Riverside Church speech, King stated, \u201cAn injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d\n\nI know that there are many in the Black community who might not understand how the issue of immigration for Latino Americans and others is linked to our issues of racial and economic justice. The goals of racial equality and economic empowerment are not exclusive or limited to Black Americans. With the \u201cbrowning\u201d of America steadily changing the racial and ethnic demographics of the population of the U.S., it important for Black Americans to be supportive of immigration reform.\n\nWe should be in solidarity with our Latino sisters and brothers because it is the moral and right thing to do. Also, supporting immigration fairness and equal justice is a strategic step forward for Black America. We know what the sting and pain of racial prejudice and injustice feels like.\n\nThe political context and timing of President Obama\u2019s executive action that will help possibly 5 million or more Latino and other undocumented people who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years should not be underestimated. This was a major leadership move by the nation\u2019s first Black president. Like health care reform, immigration reform had been debated for decades without any significant progress until Obama made it happen.\n\nYes, there is going to be a big political fight over immigration. Black Americans should weigh in on this debate from an activist perspective rather than from the position of disinterested spectators. As President Obama affirmed, \u201cWhat makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal, that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will.\u201d\n\nEquality in a democracy where people are treated fairly and justly, is a moral and noble goal that we should all strive to attain. Yet, for 45 million Black Americans, we also know the bitter taste of centuries of oppression, discrimination, injustice, violence and racial hatred. In fact, it is because of our ongoing struggle for freedom, justice and equality that we cannot afford to be silent on the issue of immigration equal justice.\u00a0\n\nI am prepared to stand with the president of the United States on this matter.

        "text":"Dining out involves grappling with\u00a0countless variables before you even order. Is your reservation at a civilized hour?\u00a0Do you have a desirable table next to attractive patrons who aren\u2019t talking about finance or constantly photographing their food? Are you located in what you consider to be a prime location of the restaurant, preferably in view of the main entrance (but not so close that you get a chill, mind)?\n\nThen the menu arrives, with its list of small plates, and a hovering waiter eager to explain it. This is all unwelcome, of course, but there is one thing everybody wants to know:\u00a0What\u00a0is the chef\u2019s signature dish? You probably know this ahead of time. The\u00a0Times\u00a0and\u00a0New York\u00a0magazine and the rest of the reviews conveniently put it in a box, with equally pressing information like the address, phone number, and whether or not they take American Express.\n\nEvery so often, there is one item on a menu that\u2019s so out of place that it catches your eye: What is that doing there?\n\nThe signature dish rules all; it\u2019s the coin of the realm. We want to bask in the chef\u2019s expertise\u2014the beef-cheek ravioli that you can\u2019t live without, the carrot that\u2019s \u201cInstagrammable,\u201d the piece of meat with a gigantic bone sticking out of it. Menus are built around famous dishes. Some receive names burnished with legend, like French Laundry\u2019s \u201cOysters and Pearls.\u201d At the soon to be shuttered\u00a0wd~50, there was a tasting menu devoted to Wylie Dufresne\u2019s greatest hits, like shrimp cannelloni with chorizo and Thai basil\u2014proof of patrons\u2019 ongoing devotion\u00a0to the avant-garde classics.\u00a0Even if you know better, you feel like you should play to the chef\u2019s most famous strength. When somebody asks if you\u2019ve had the cote de boeuf at Minetta Tavern, you want to be able to say, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve had it, but, to be honest, I prefer the one at Blanca.\u201d\n\nsiberia_lugersThe menu at Peter Luger leaves no ambiguity\u00a0about what the signature dish is. (Photo: Michaelgallagher\/Flickr)\u00a0\n\nSome restaurants signal\u00a0an important dish by adorning it with hard-to-miss graphic flourishes. On Rotisserie Georgette\u2019s lunch menu, the highly recommended\u00a0poulet frites\u00a0is surrounded by a tall ellipsis. At Peter Luger, if you even bother to look at a menu, you\u2019ll find a large box that says Steak for Two, Steak for Three, and so on. Traditionally, most menus have had their own internal logic\u2014you progress from light to heavy, from fish to fowl and on to beef. There are rarely surprises. But every so often, there is one item on a menu that\u2019s so out of place that it catches your eye: What is\u00a0that\u00a0doing there?\n\nIt\u2019s either a woeful miscalculation or something so incongruous it must be truly inspired. Not the three-pound lobster at a steak restaurant, or a token gluten-free choice. No, this is a dish with some thought behind\u00a0it, but one that still seems out of place. Like a comic actor playing Hamlet, it\u2019s either a poor gimmick or truly visionary. Think of it as ordering Siberia.\n\nThis thought occurred to me when numerous friends mentioned that the burger at Lure, the Soho seafood\u00a0restaurant, was surprisingly good. If you go to a restaurant that serves sushi, chances are you\u2019re not going to progress to the burger. But like those people who go to a concert to\u00a0see the opening act, there is a knowing circle of aficionados that\u00a0goes to Lure just for the beef.\n\nsiberia_lureburgerDespite specializing in seafood, Lure Fishbar has a devoted following for its burger. (Photo: Lure Fishbar)\n\nThe dish that\u2019s always surprised me most is the duck at Le Bernardin. The only meat on a menu entirely devoted to seafood, it\u2019s under the mercurial menu category \u201cUpon Request,\u201d as if it should be ordered in a whisper. Just what happens when you make this request? Does the waiter raise an eyebrow? Are you discretely escorted from the dining room? Does Eric Ripert come out of the kitchen and explain the premise\u00a0of the entire restaurant?\n\nSo I went to Le Bernardin with the perverse intention of\u00a0not even ordering fish.\u00a0This struck me as downright devious\u2014in the four-star dining sense, as incongruous as buying a painting by Bob Dylan. The no-fish plan was quickly dashed when the kitchen brought out its\u00a0wonderful salmon rillette to start. Then I enjoyed a finely sliced artichoke with a light vegetable risotto\u00a0in\u00a0lemon broth. Delightful.\n\nOne of the conditions of ordering Siberia is that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting into\u2014it\u2019s necessarily unexpected..\n\nThe main course was crispy duck breast, slightly salted, quite rare, garnished with snow peas and finished with a sour cherry sauce. Was it good? Of course it was good; everything at Le Bernardin is beautifully executed. I drank red wine. I\u2019ve never had red wine at Le Bernardin before. Then I thought a moment. Eric Ripert, and his chefs, are clearly inspired by fish\u2014that\u2019s what drives them, what animates their cooking. That\u2019s what they dream about, why the restaurant exists, and, ultimately, why it excels. My meal was lovely, but it wasn\u2019t transporting in the way other meals I\u2019ve had there were. Le Bernardin makes it seem like they\u2019ve invented every fish they serve\u2014each preparation\u00a0feels like the first time you\u2019re truly\u00a0tasting something. This duck experience felt more earthbound. And the fault was certainly not theirs\u2014I ordered the meal. They didn\u2019t misrepresent themselves; I did that myself.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way. At Le Grand Vefour, the two-star Michelin restaurant on the Palais Royal in Paris, the historic room is remarkably elegant. Colette ate there, as\u00a0did Fragonard. There\u2019s a dish that neither would recognize at the bottom of chef Guy Martin\u2019s otherwise reassuring menu: The last of the desserts is an artichoke tart. It\u2019s a compelling suggestion. It turns out to be neither sweet nor savory, a thin layer of\u00a0cr\u00e8me brulee\u00a0combined with artichokes, and covered with candied vegetables. It\u2019s masterful.\n\n\nCr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e aux artichauts at Le Grand Vefor (photo: Saundra Austoni\/L\u2019esprit Sud Magazine)\n\nOne of the conditions of ordering Siberia is that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting into\u2014it\u2019s necessarily unexpected. There\u2019s a\u00a0backstory you\u2019re eager to learn, like when a\u00a0mysterious guest shows up at a party. The Monte Carlo, in my hometown Minneapolis, serves steak, chops, and fried chicken in a classic midcentury room. They also offer beef liver. I asked once what that was doing there, and the owner said he tried to take it off the menu, but a small, vocal minority came in to order just that, and they would be damned if it was going to go away.\n\nOne suspects that\u2019s what chicken hash is still doing at the \u201921\u2019 Club\u2014that it got grandfathered in, and that there are devotees who insisted on its presence. And that\u2019s the beauty of ordering Siberia. It\u2019s a reminder that traditions can\u2019t be predicted, and that every unexpected dish was new once, hoping to become a standby with its own devoted following.",

        "text":"The Corner\n\nWashington Post: Vote for Mark Warner Because He\u2019ll Raise Your Taxes\n\nToday\u2019s Washington Post endorsement of Democratic Virginia senator Mark Warner is not surprising, but the editorial board\u2019s case against Republican challenger Ed Gillespie is a revealing window on how people think in the city that takes what America makes:\n\nWe understand that Mr. Gillespie, who faced a competitive GOP primary, is loath to alienate Republican hard-liners. Yet his opposition to any new taxes \u2014 read: any compromise \u2014 is exactly the sort of promise that produces congressional paralysis and would defeat a bargain to cure the nation\u2019s fiscal ills\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\n\nMr. Gillespie, a former lobbyist, national and state GOP chairman and top adviser to President George W. Bush, has deep political and policy experience. Unlike many Republicans who have been content to attack Obamacare, he proposed an alternative \u2014 albeit one that would offer far less protection to vulnerable patients.\n\nMr. Gillespie has the skills to be a bipartisan player in the Senate, as Mr. Warner has been. Yet by promising never to compromise on taxes, he has taken himself out of the hunt for an exit from America\u2019s fiscal impasse.\n\nIf only the voters \u2014 who are constantly telling pollsters that they\u2019re fed up with Washington business as usual and forcing lifelong politicians to make improbable claims to \u201coutsider\u201d status \u2014 were as reasonable as the Post\u2019s editorial board. The argument seems to be that what\u2019s good about Gillespie is that he is another get-along-go-along pol; but unfortunately, he\u2019s not quite as easy as Warner.\n\nThe equation of \u201cnew taxes\u201d with \u201ccompromise\u201d \u2014 which the paper should really be embarrassed to make after the stunning non-apocalypses of the budget sequester and the partial shutdown of some non-essential government services last year \u2014 also elides a point the two campaigns have been arguing over. Though Warner claims Gillespie signed the tax pledge created by Americans For Tax Reform\u2019s Grover Norquist, and his campaign even flooded the press room with literature to that effect at Monday\u2019s debate, Grover himself has shot that story down. As Post Virginia reporters Jenna Portnoy and Laura Vozzella point out, \u201cNorquist tweeted late Monday that Gillespie did not sign the pledge: \u201cGillespie told me he would not sign pledges. He didn\u2019t. He told the people of Virginia he wouldn\u2019t raise their taxes. He won\u2019t. Warner did.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe ed board\u2019s case for Warner also mentions his successful governorship, \u201cability to cross partisan lines,\u201d and the fact that many people still think he\u2019s John Warner. (OK, not that last one.) But the only case against Gillespie is his opposition to \u201cnew revenue\u201d to \u201ctackle the nation\u2019s fiscal problems in a balanced way.\u201d In fact, as Ohio University economist Richard Vedder demonstrated in a 1980s study that has been repeated with the same results many times since, every dollar of tax revenue raised leads to more than one dollar of new spending by Congress. Studies of revenue-based deficit reduction efforts in other countries have shown the same.\n\nGillespie has closed some of his very wide polling gap against Warner, but other than a September Quinnipiac poll that showed him trailing by nine points, he has never come within double-digits of the incumbent. But the power of incumbency is not a ratification of bad math. Raising taxes only makes the country\u2019s fiscal problems worse. Americans know that. Washingtonians don\u2019t.\n\nMost Popular\n\n\nThe Rise of the Chinese-American Right\n\nOn June 13, during a nasty storm, a group of Chinese New Yorkers gathered in front of the gates of Gracie Mansion, the New York mayor\u2019s residence on the Upper East Side, to protest.

Ancient Egyptian priestesses used sistra, a type of musical rattle with metal discs that we now know generates copious amounts of ultrasound, only used in western medicine since the 1930's.

The innocent glee as everyone claimed their space was reminiscent of a childhood sleepover.\n\nI lay there allowing myself to be carried away on layers of ambient music, sounds derived from nature, hypnotic melodies, ethereal soundscapes and subtle shamanic rhythms. To my surprise I found that where I would usually be focused on a still or moving image during meditation, the lack of external visual stimulation was almost immediately replaced by internal images, called into focus by my minds eye.\n\nMy brain interpreted certain sounds as birds, waves, trees; at one point I was standing on the balcony of a tree house I had stayed at in Sri Lanka a few months previously and was filled with the same feeling of peace, happiness and fulfilment I had felt there.\n\nAmazing! I thought, who needs to fly half way round the world... paradise is a state of mind and somehow lying in a darkened room, listening to this atmospheric soundscape, had stimulated in me the sense of being on holiday.\n\nBliss gave way to other emotions as my subconscious seemed to be working it's way through memories and fragments of emotional debris still floating around, not quite forgotten. In this state I did not become upset, it was almost as in a dream, where complex emotions and experiences can be processed in a more abstract way. But here I was more lucid than I might be whilst fully dreaming, a detached observer of my own thoughts and feelings.\n\nAt one point I heard something reminiscent of ghosts howling. Afterwards I asked Fabio what it was and was surprised to discover it was the sound of planets recorded by NASA.\n\nFascinated that even the largest objects known to humankind emit a sound, I began to read up on the smallest and came across the work of James Gimzewski, a professor in nanotechnology and sonocytology at The University of California, LA.\n\nGimzewski modified an atomic force microscope so that he was able to detect the vibrations of the cell wall of a living cell. These vibrations, once amplified using computer software, create audible sound. What's more, Gimzewski discovered that cancerous cells emit a slightly different sound to healthy cells; leading to the hope that sonocytology may someday have applications in early cancer detection and diagnosis.\n\nIn clinical trials at the University of West Virginia, ultra sound is being used to perform brain surgery on fully conscious patients, without having to go through the invasive procedures usually associated with brain operations.\n\nAlthough our scientific endeavours to better understand the healing potential of sound are still in their infancy, I believe we stand on the precipice of a giant leap in human evolution; brought about by science and spiritual experience, knowledge and practices finally coming together. Two halves of the same picture.\n\nResearchers at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow, India recently discovered that listening to the sound OM (an ancient sacred sound in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism) activates areas of the brain involved with emotional empathy and relaxes the parts of the brain used in everyday functioning.\n\nThat night as I slept I experienced a lucid dream. I knew without doubt that I was dreaming as I watched the dramas of my subconscious unfold. I awoke with a renewed sense of purpose, recalling some very clear messages I had received during the dream.\n\nWe all seek guidance, but what I now realise is that everything we need to know is inside our mind already; we just have to connect and listen.",

        "text":"Bel Canto eVo 200.2 power amplifier Followup\n\nKalman Rubinson wrote a Followup in November 2001 (Vol.24 No.11):\n\nHow do you know when your system is really loud? If you don't have a sound-level meter, you can wait for your neighbors to complain or for your ears to bleed. But long before that point, a system will begin to give telltale signs\u2014like dynamic compression and increased distortion, which are often misinterpreted as meaning \"loud\" rather than \"distorted.\"\n\nWell, I don't generally get to that point with my regular equipment and musical preferences, and when I auditioned the $2395 Bel Canto eVo 200.2 power amplifier for the March 2001 Stereophile, I found nothing lacking in its ability to drive my speakers as loud as necessary. I was shocked when John Atkinson's test results showed that our review sample could not output its rated power because, according to Bel Canto's \"Manufacturer's Comment,\" the set-point of the protection circuitry was too conservative.\n\nBefore I learned any of this, I had already requested another eVo 200.2\u2014not because I felt I needed more power, but to set up the pair of them as bridged monoblocks. The amp's design invites bridging because the two channels in each eVo are connected to the power supply in opposite polarity. Feed in one signal, push a button, and bridged output is available without having to add any signal-inversion circuitry. It was no surprise that, in view of JA's results, Bel Canto sent me two spanking-new 200.2s, which I promptly bridged and biwired to my Revel Ultima Studio loudspeakers. I waited until no one was around, put on Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops' recording of the Polka and Fugue from Weinberger's Schwanda the Bagpiper (Telarc CD-80115), and let 'er rip.\n\nAll went gloriously well until the end, when, with the orchestral forces already in full cry, Telarc's infamous bass drum and a pipe organ pile on. Burp! The protection relays in the left-channel eVo clicked on and off, totally destroying the musical continuity. I reversed channels and, lo and behold, now the eVo on the right choked. Sure, the system had been turned up to 11\u2014something I almost never do\u2014but the problem was clearly related to the musical power demands of the left-channel signal. But with an estimated 800Wpc on tap, this should not have been happening.\n\nBoth EVos recovered from the ordeal just fine, and as I pondered whether to chalk up their burping to excessive expectations or to ask Bel Canto to take them back, the phone rang\u2014Bel Canto's Mike McCormick wanted to know how it was going. Before I could tell him the bad news, he volunteered that these amps, too, had had their protection cutoffs set too low. The fix was simple: Just open the amps and snip out one resistor from each. The entire process took less than five minutes; the hardest part was finding the right-size hex key for the chassis screws.\n\nAfter I'd snipped out the resistors, the EVos were unflappable. But without that suggestion from Bel Canto, there's no way to know from the outside what's going on inside the 200.2. If your experience of the amp has been anything like mine, give Bel Canto a call.\n\nThe bridged-and-snipped eVo was a bear of an amp. With the aforementioned Weinberger re-heated, the drum and organ bellowed forth on top of the orchestra, and nothing faltered. Except, perhaps, my resolve to do it again\u2014neighbors I'd never before spoken with complimented me on the music. Because no additional circuitry is required to bridge the 200.2, it was no surprise that, used as a monoblock, the eVo sounded much like one of its own stereo channels, but with seemingly limitless power. The midrange dryness and slightly analytic HF character that I'd noted in my original review with a single stereo 2000.2 were much reduced, but that perception is possibly related to my long use of and adaptation to them.\n\nOn the other hand, with continued exposure, a device with a characteristic flavor is just as likely to become annoying. But the eVo reminded me of Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat: The longer I listened, the more my concerns faded, until only my smile remained. I'll underscore this by saying that I wrote my effusive encomia (Stereophile, September 2001) about the sound quality made possible by the TacT RCS 2.0 room equalizer while the monoblock eVo 200.2s were doing the heavy lifting.\n\nThe monoblock EVo, however, was just as picky as the stereo eVo about getting the level just right for each recording. Finding this level became a regular but unstrenuous ritual for classical music\u2014a single tweak at the beginning usually served for the rest of the disc. With pop and jazz discs, whose miking and performers can change from track to track, a bit more involvement and work was required. The remote control of my Sonic Frontiers Line-3 preamplifier made this easier; the results were their own reward.\n\nHowever much I loved the eVo 200.2s, they exist in a complex context. Bel Canto has recently introduced eVo amplifiers with 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6 amplifier modules. I don't think you can go wrong with any of these options, as they all seem to be based on the same \"Tripath\" amp module. With the resistor snipped, the unleashed stereo 200.2 was even better than the original I auditioned, and had quite enough power for all but headbangers, or those with very inefficient speakers.\n\nWhen a single 200.2 will do, of course, there's no need for two. However, the multichannel EVos are blessed with a 1500VA power transformer rather than the 538VA transformer in the 200.2. And for those who need the muscle, a four-channel 200.4 is less expensive and less bulky than a pair of two-channel 200.2s. To use bridged EVos for each of my two stereo channels, I'd have to decide if the potential value of the 1500VA transformer in a 200.4 outweighed the advantage of using very short but very excellent speaker cables with a pair of 200.2s. While I lean toward the latter, what really intrigues me is a lateral move to a 200.5 for my multichannel system.\n\nYeah, that's the ticket\u2014EVos all around!\u2014Kalman Rubinson\n\nEnter your username.\nEnter the password that accompanies your username.",

        "text":"\n\n\u201cGolden Wings\u201d by Jackson Scholz\n\nLink - Posted by David on April 3, 2020 @ 6:00 am in\n\nTHIS week we have a story from the prolific pen of Jackson Scholz. Scholz originally shot to prominence in the world of sports as a record holding sprinter, taking a gold medal in the 4\u00d7100m Relay at the Antwerp Olympics in 1920 and Gold in the 200m and Silver in the 100m at the Paris Olympics in 1924\u2014the Olympics depicted in the movie Chariots of Fire (1981) in which Brad Davis portrayed Scholz. Scholz even appeared in an American Express commercial with Ben Cross at the time.\n\nKnowing you can\u2019t run forever, Scholz started writing stories and submitting them to the magazines. He drew upon his own experiences, which is probably why most of his pulp stories are sports stories, but he did find time to pen some detective stories, a few westerns, and a couple dozen aviation tales\u2014including four for Air Trails with Jiggs Neely. Neely is a young Pensacola graduate just as Scholz himself had been. In \u201cGolden Wings,\u201d Jiggs Neely tries to play it cool and keep in line after being told his actions could jeopardize his chances of earning his wings in the coming week. From the pages of the July 1929 Air Trails, it\u2019s Jackson Scholz\u2019 \u201cGolden Wings!\u201d\n\nA high-speed story of naval aviation by a pilot-writer who won his wings at Pensacola.\n\n\nAnd as a bonus, here\u2019s an article from The Lincoln Sunday Star about how Jackson Scholz keeps busy between running and writing!\n\n\nWriting and Running Keep Jackson Scholz Busy\n\nThe Lincoln Sunday Star, Lincoln, NB \u2022 3 July 1927\n\nJackson V. Scholz, Olympic sprint champion of \u201924, who is running for the New York A.C. in Lincoln this week end, is a writer of sports stories. Mr. Scholz published a book of track stories early in the spring and is a frequent contributor to sports magazines.\n\nHe likes to dance\u2014two or three dances with good dancers\u2014and stop.\n\nHe\u2019s devoted to golf, and would play ail the time If he had a portable course.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t care for night clubs.\n\nHe enjoys reading\u2014a lot. He won a cup in tennis one bright day.\n\nHe\u2019s a modest soul, and given to beating himself lightly. He\u2019s unspoiled by many newspaper columns of laudatory acclaim.\n\nHe\u2019s \u201ckeen\u201d about bus riding-on top of a Fifth avenue bus, from Washington arch out to the drive. He likes to be with people, to watch them, to study them psychologically, but he does not claim to be a student of or to comprehend human nature.\n\nHe\u2019s stimulated by an intelligent conversationalist\u2014one whose mind, as he says, is sharper than his, and can turn his \u201cinside out.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s traveled everywhere\u2014the Orient, Asia, the continent, and any number of \u201csee America first\u201d tours, but he\u2019s not a collector. If he brings anything back to his apartment near Riverside drive, it\u2019s different from anything else that has been in that apartment.\n\nScholz Not Blatant.\n\nYou can see him. A normal sort of young man. Jackson Scholz, with a college degree and nice blue eyes and dark gray spring suit with just the right cut. Not especially tall, very quiet, walking softly, not at all the blatant athletic type of young man who adorns the posters.\n\nYet Jackson Scholz has the fastest legs In the world, legs as famous as \u201cwe,\u201d and that have made his name known round the world for their performances on half its continents.\n\nHe\u2019s Olympic champion in the 200 metres, having run this event in the Paris Olympics in 21 6-10 seconds in 1924. the only American to come through with a sprint championship In those Olympics. He has been national A.A.U. champion in the sprint, and formerly was holder of the sprint championship\u2014for the century and the 220 yard dash\u2014in the Missouri valley conference for three years.\n\nThe winged-foot sprinter, here for the A.A.U. meet, was developed by Coach H.F. Schulte in his University of Missouri days, of which university Jackson Scholz is a graduate. He thinks a lot of his former coach, and gives much of the credit for his success to his training. Jackson Scholz knew in his high school days that many were destined to gaze at his fleeting heela, but it was Coach Schulte who developed him and taught him the fine points of the running game.\n\nWriting Sport Stories\n\nJackson Scholz is one of sparkling names in Lincoln this weekend, but he hasn\u2019t earned all the sparkles with his feet. Some are due to his mind, and his fingers.\n\nWhen he isn\u2019t running, he\u2019s writing. Writing with a purpose.\n\nThe first story he wrote, he sold, which was happy news for him and sad for those ambitious souls who send their manuscripts on a world tour in hope of a sale. Since that day, he\u2019s been a regular contributor to sport story magazines.\n\nWhen the legs refuse to speed longer, writing is to be his profession. Possibly a little coaching on the side, for he thinks he would like to pass on to the newcomers the knowledge he has gained in his years of sprinting, but most of the hours to be devoted to writing. Some sport stories, but largely fiction.\n\nIt\u2019s not an ambition without foundation, because Jackson Scholz is the writing runner.\n\nHe has just published a book of short stories, \u201cSplit Seconds,\u201d tales of the cinder track. The stories are told by an old coach, and it is Coach Schulte upon whom Mr. Scholz has modeled his coach, who solves the manv problems of his young athletes. Grantland Rice, sport feature writer for the New York Herald-Tribune. wrote the introduction\n\nKeeps Detailed Diary.\n\nOn his trips hither and yon. Mr. Scholz keeps a detailed diary. It has some 50.000 words, sans notes, at the moment, and some day it is probable it will appear for public perusal. He has just sold a 30,000 word autobiography.\n\nJackson V. Scholz isn\u2019t a writer because he hasn\u2019t a knowledge of other jobs.\n\nThe high boots and the broad hat of the landed squire appealed to him, and for three years he perused agricultural lore in college. A couple of years of milking cows and cultivating corn convinced him of the error of his thoughts.\n\nDuring the late unpleasantness, he was a pilot in the navy flying corps, that occupied him in 1918 and 1919. He returned to graduate in journalism at Missouri.\n\nFollowed the 1920 Olympics, when he was a member of the winning relay team at Antwerp, and on an exhibition tour of the Scandinavian countries.\n\nReal estate in Detroit intrigued him for a time, but for a brief time. With dreams of becoming a merchant prince he attached himself to a hosiery concern in New York City. Fifteen or twenty dollars every Saturday night does not make affluent living in the metropolis.\n\nBecame Newspaperman.\n\nHis journalism certificate came to hand and he was with the United Press, a newspaper wire service, for a year and one-half, most of the time in New York. Editing wires\u2014making 2,500 words into twenty-five lines\u2014lost its thrill after a time and Mr. Scholz returned to more creative lines of endeavor.\n\nDuring his U.P. days, he wrote and sold his story, the first one. That aided and abetted his later decision.\n\nIn the fall of \u201823. he decided he wanted to make the Olympics at Paris, and he trained for eight months. In the final tryouts. be made a new world\u2019s record for the 200 metres, a record that still stands. He went to Paris, winning honors of which the world knows.\n\nWhile competing in the Irish Olympics at Dublin, he received an invitation from Japan for a series of meets. Three Americana and one Finn toured Japan for two and one-half months. Competing races, which, upon insistence, Mr. Scholz admits he won all of the dozen, and speeches, many speeches, filled the days.\n\nTraveled With Hahn.\n\nIn 1925, Jackson Scholz and Lloyd Hahn, Nebraska\u2019s fleet footed boy, were in New Zealand. \u201cFifteen meets and twice that many speeches,\u201d Mr. Scholz characterizes the seventy-five days.\n\nNor are all his records sprint records.\n\nHe was the oldest runner in the last Olympics. He is the oldest runner actively participating in sprint circles today. Yet, he only won his first gold medal in the eighty-five pound championship of southern California in 1911, so yet thirty or forty years before he loses his speed and spryness.\n\nIf this man, whose record shows that he has outsprinted Charley Paddock in seven out of ten races in which they have been matched makes the Olympic team in 1927, he will be the first sprinter to make the trip three times. Charles Paddock and Loren Murchison are also entering the tryouts for the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, and if all three enter it will be the first trio to make the three contests.\n\nIn August, Mr. Schole sails for Germany to enter a meet there. The first one will be held September 4.\n\nBut the end will come, of course Mr. Scholz knows it.\n\n\u201cOf course, some day some youngster is going to get to the tape first. I know it. It\u2019s inevitable.\n\n\u201cIf I had it all to do over again, I\u2019d do just as I\u2019ve done. I wouldn\u2019t have missed the fun and the competition for a couple of life times.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s Applause Pleasing.\n\n\u201cThe sincere adulation of the children means as much as anything. The cries of the crowd, the back slapping, and hand wringing of people is pleasant, we iiKe it, but there\u2019s something fine in this worship of the children.\n\n\u201cI like to\u2019 think that possibly we mean something real to them, that we are passing on some worthwhile spirit to these youngsters.\u201d\n\nThe holder of the 200 metres record has his sense of humor. He has seen funny moments in his dashing about the world.\n\nIt was at Histon, near Cambridge, and Jackson Scholz and Cyril Coatee, a Canadian sprinter, shared honors that day with an English country fair. The whistles and the bells and the shrill music of the carnival rent the air, and the two sprinters did their best as athletes of honor on a grassy track that tipped perilously down hill.\n\nThrongs Left for Tea.\n\nIn the midst of the meet, the throngs disappeared. The noise stopped. The two looked dismayed as they trotted back up the track to peer about.\n\nIt was tea time. That was all, but suffient.\n\nThe two sprinters were taken into the midst of the crowds who had gat... (truncated)",

        "text":"Pre-emptive action is vital in the battle against cyber attacks\n\nby Simon Howe, ANZ Sales Director, LogRhythm\n\nOnce the subject of alarmist science fiction movies, cybersecurity breaches have now become an all-too-common feature of modern life.\n\nFrom attacks on power grids and nuclear reactors to the disabling of business IT systems and theft of data stores, the activities of cyber criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated. As a result, the damage and disruption they can cause is growing by the day.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWith the number of threats continuing to increase, there are four key action areas in which Australian organisations should be focusing. Taking steps in each of these will reduce the likelihood of falling victim to an attack and help with mitigation should one occur. The action areas are:\u00a0\n\n1. Constantly monitor vulnerabilities\nThankfully, most organisations now have basic IT security measures in place, but it must be remembered that this is far from being a set-and-forget exercise. IT teams need to constantly update operating systems and applications on a regular basis to ensure they can withstand new threats.\n\nFailure to do this can have big ramifications. For example, the WannaCry ransomware strain that hit victims in 2017 succeeded because it exploited a vulnerability in Windows that had been identified weeks earlier. Microsoft had released a patch for the bug, but many organisations failed to apply it, leaving them open to the exploit. The Petya\/NotPetya attacks soon followed and used another known vulnerability to target Ukrainian infrastructure and huge companies such as shipping giant Maersk.\n\nIT departments must have a robust process in place to become aware of security vulnerabilities as they are disclosed \u2013 and to apply patches as soon as they\u2019re available.\n\n2. Focus on employee training\n\nIt\u2019s often said that the weakest link in any IT infrastructure is the users, and this is backed by the fact that Phishing remains one of the most common techniques used by cybercriminals.\n\nResearch\u00a0 has found that two thirds of organisations have fallen victim to social engineering attacks, while whaling\/CEO fraud is becoming increasingly common as a way to dupe individuals into making payments into the accounts of cybercriminals.\n\nFor this reason, all staff need to be trained effectively to spot the warning signs of attacks. To make this more effective, organisations are turning to gamification techniques\u00a0 to make training more engaging for staff.\nDefined by Gartner as \u201cthe use of game mechanics and experience design to digitally engage and motivate people to achieve their goals\u201d, gamification is being successfully used by the likes of Ford, Deloitte and PwC to make their workforces more security-savvy.\n\n3. Don\u2019t pretend nothing has happened\n\nDuring 2017, Uber acknowledged a major data leak had compromised 57 million user accounts. The company also admitted it had paid hackers $100,000 to conceal and destroy the stolen data.\n\nThe way the company dealt with the breach led to its chief security officer leaving his post and resulted in an investor consortium offering 30 per cent less than share value for a stake in the company.\n\nA similar incident occurred when credit-rating agency Equifax waited until September 2017 to report a hack of 143 million personal information records that had occurred in July of that year. The company\u2019s CEO, CIO and CSO all resigned once it became clear that there had been a delay in reporting the incident.\nIt is likely the impact of these breaches wouldn\u2019t have been so severe if the organisations had been upfront about them. Businesses should therefore be transparent when they suffer a security breach.\u00a0\n\n4. Get more sophisticated\n\nIn general, recent cybersecurity breaches suggest that many organisations need to become more sophisticated in their security capabilities.\n\nFor example, when it comes to phishing, two-factor authentication can severely reduce risks, as it makes stolen credentials extremely difficult to use. Also, mobile devices linked to corporate networks should be encrypted to ensure confidential data that\u2019s contained, communicated and accessed by them is difficult for third parties to obtain.\n\nThe segmentation of corporate networks, with authentication required to move between segments, also makes it more difficult for attackers to get at the data they\u2019re seeking, making it too costly and time-consuming for them to pursue.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good move to put in place a security incident and event management (SIEM) together with relevant network monitoring and user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA). Such systems will ensure an organisation is much better prepared to rapidly detect and respond to compromises.\n\nAt the very least IT teams need to be diligent about applying software patches and providing compelling and effective training for users. They should also have detailed plans in place for how to report and respond to successful breaches.\n\nConsidering these four action areas now will put your organisation in a much better position to withstand cyberattacks and deal with any that might succeed.\n\nJoin the newsletter!\n\n\nSign up to gain exclusive access to email subscriptions, event invitations, competitions, giveaways, and much more.\n\nMembership is free, and your security and privacy remain protected.

        "text":"Market Commentary\n\nWeekly Market Commentary May 21, 2018\n\nadmin May 21st, 2018\n\nThe Markets\n\nToo much? Too little? Or just right?\n\nU.S. stock markets were relatively calm, although they finished the week lower. U.S. Treasury yields hit a 7-year high and finished the week above 3 percent. While these were notable, the most remarkable events last week occurred beyond our borders. These include:\n\n  \u2022 The Vatican publishing a position paper on financial markets. Its opening was, \u201cEconomic and financial issues draw our attention today as never before because of the growing influence of financial markets on the material well-being of most of humankind. What is needed, on the one hand, is an appropriate regulation of the dynamics of the markets and, on the other hand, a clear ethical foundation that assures a well-being realized through the quality of human relationships rather than merely through economic mechanisms that by themselves cannot attain it.\u201d\n  \u2022 The royal wedding boosting the British economy. A normal Britain wedding costs about \u00a318 thousand and includes about 80 guests. Prince Harry\u2019s nuptials were a bit more lavish. A wedding planning company estimated the cost of hosting 600 or more guests at \u00a332 million ($43 million in U.S. dollars). The largest component of the cost was \u00a330 million for security, which included drone destroyers.\n  \u2022 Venezuela\u2019s oil-based economy continuing to collapse as oil prices rise. \u201cVenezuela leads the world in two things: oil reserves and incompetence,\u201d opined The Washington Post. Poor management of the state-run oil industry has caused production to drop 23 percent since December. The country\u2019s declining production helped push oil prices higher last week.

Apparently, the wealth of billionaires increased by 24 percent during 2017. In addition, the billionaire population, which had suffered reduced numbers since 2015, expanded. It now includes 2,754 individuals. The previous high was 2,473 in 2015. According to Wealth-X:\n\n  \u2022 816 live in the Asia-Pacific region\n  \u2022 884 live in the Americas\n  \u2022 1,054 live in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa\n\nThere is a bit of disagreement about the size of the \u2018Three-Comma Club\u2019 and the rate at which its wealth is increasing. In March 2018, Forbes reported there were \u201c\u20262,208 billionaires from 72 countries and territories including the first ever from Hungary and Zimbabwe. This elite group is worth $9.1 trillion, up 18 percent since last year. Their average net worth is a record $4.1 billion. Americans lead the way with a record 585 billionaires, followed by Mainland China with 373.\u201d\n\nTwo hundred and fifty-six women made the list, including 42 new additions.\n\nThe Giving Pledge is another exclusive group that some billionaires have joined. The objective of the Pledge is to \u201c\u2026help address society\u2019s most pressing problems by inviting the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals and families to commit more than half of their wealth to philanthropy or charitable causes either during their lifetime or in their will.\u201d\n\nAs of February 2018, 175 billionaires from 22 countries had joined.\n\nWeekly Focus \u2013 Think About It\n\n\u201cPhilanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently appreciated by mankind.\u201d\n\n\u2013Henry David Thoreau, American essayist and naturalist\n\nBest regards,\n\nKelly P.

        "text":"What is the single most necessary trait for a long term happy relationship?\n\n\/ \/ A Table For Six\n\nA new relationship guide by Dr Tashiro, a psychology professor, writes that singles looking for long-lasting love should limit their list on their checklist to only three. He writes that good looks and money should not be included in that list.\n\nDr Ty Tashiro writes in his book \u201cThe Science of Happily Ever After\u201d, that the problem is that singles want everything in a potential partner and that results in them ending up with nothing.\n\nHe says that personality traits should be concentrated on and that the \u201cagreeable\u201d trait is the key to sustainable love and desire. Being agreeable will show up as someone who is forgiving, cooperative, good-natured, flexible, trusting, soft-hearted and tolerant.\n\nAlternatively, a partner who has a quality of \u201cNeuroticism\u201d is someone who is prone to anxiety, depression, embarrassment, emotional instability and insecurity. Dr Tashiro says that people with this trait are the worst for relationship sustainability.\n\nFrom his own research Dr Tashiro reiterates that good looks are not a a predictor of satisfying relationships, nor do they correlate to happier marriages. In fact, there is \u201cno reliable association between physical attractiveness and relationship satisfaction,\u201d he writes.\n\nIn regard to money, his research has shown that it does not keep a relationship buoyant, at least over a certain point.\n\nMoney does make a difference on the lower end of the scale, but for those above $75,000 there seems to be diminishing returns on happiness in marriage. \u201cOnce this threshold is crossed, there is no significant association between more wealth and higher levels of psychological well-being\u201d, Dr Tashiro writes.\n\nHe encourages singles to be more realistic in their expectations to improve the odds of finding a compatible mate. Dr Tashiro states that society\u2019s fairy-tale view of romance where 88% of adults believe in \u201csoul mates\u201d \u2013 has contributed to the fact that although 90% of people will marry in their lifetimes, only one in three will find long-lasting love.\n\nHe says that many women will search for a man who is handsome, tall and makes good money, but only about one percent of the suitors they are likely to meet will fit into this category.\n\nDr Tashiro states that his book is about making smarter choices and learning to weed out the undesirable traits and rethinking our views about what really matters in a romantic partner.\n\nOur A Table for Six dinners are a great tool to use to meet singles face to face in a relaxed environment. You\u2019ll have an opportunity to interact and also observe other singles interacting in a social situation with no pressure.

        "text":"Birth Control Without Prescription\n\nMOST POPULAR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS: Alesse | Desogen | Duphaston | Levlen | Mircette | Ortho Tri-Cyclen | Plan B | Yasmin\n\nThe only birth control method that is 100% effective is abstinence\n\nThe word 'abstinence' means abstaining from sexual intercourse. Today, many teenagers are being educated about this form of protection against unwanted pregnancies. The rate of teenager pregnancies has escalated over the past 10 years at an alarming rate. The number of teenagers with sexually transmitted diseases has also risen. In many countries, sex education with an emphasis on abstinence is being given to young teenagers in an attempt to reduce these statistics.\n\nTeenagers are encouraged not to have sexual intercourse until they are married. They are told that sex before marriage is not only morally wrong, but they can also be infected with sexually transmitted diseases like HIV\/AIDS. Abstinence education does not involve information about any other birth control methods. The educationists who promote abstinence believe that, because it is successful with driving, drinking, and drugs, it will discourage teenagers from having sex.\n\nHowever, there are many people who disagree. Let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of abstinence and then you can form your own opinion. The biggest advantage is that teenagers get to learn that the only way to avoid an unwanted pregnancy 100 percent is through abstinence. In addition, it makes them realize that abstinence can save them from sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nAnother big advantage is that teenagers are spared the psychological and emotional trauma that comes with an unwanted pregnancy. Many women who became pregnant as young girls say that they regret being sexually active at the time. In the case where the girls gave up their children for adoption, or had an abortion, many say that they carried the guilt for years. This caused unhappiness and depression in later life, and they also got into relationships\/marriages that did not work. If a teenager practices abstinence, he or she is more likely to form a long-lasting and loving relationship.\n\nNow, let's look at the other side of the coin - what critics of abstinence say. Firstly, the biggest disadvantage is that there is no guarantee that teenagers will, in fact, not have sex even if they say they won't. Apparently, there is evidence to prove this claim. Many teenagers have in fact gone to the extreme by starting to experiment with sex at even younger ages.\n\nCritics say that by telling a teenager to be abstinent is only going to make them more interested in having sex. It's the old story of an adult telling a teenager to do something for his or her own good, and the teenager responding by doing precisely the opposite, as an act of rebellion.\n\nSome believe that teenagers are going to experiment with sex whether their parents and teachers like it or not. Therefore, critics believe that teenagers should rather be educated about birth control methods so that they can practice safe sex.\n\nHaving looked at the pros and cons of this controversial subject, you might be one of the numerous people who believe that the ideal solution is a combination of abstinence education and birth control education. Teachers and parents should perhaps teach teenagers that they should only indulge in sexual intercourse if they feel it is right, and if they use contraceptives.",

        "text":"Immigration: a hostile act\n\nIssue section:\u00a0\n\nThe government's new bill aims to create a \"hostile environment\" for illegal migrants. Alan Gibson looks at the measures in the proposed law and how it will target all migrants and serve to stoke up racism.\n\nWhat is the declared aim of the bill?\n\nTo create a \"hostile environment for illegal migrants\". This will be done by forcing landlords, NHS staff and public servants, and bank staff, to check the immigration status of migrants who are potential tenants, users of NHS services, appliers for a driving licence or a bank account. Other proposed measures include a drastic reduction in rights of appeal and bail, and a denial of the right of appeal prior to deportation.\n\nWhat will the residential measures mean?\n\nLandlords will be faced with such a complex task that they are likely to turn away anyone who looks like a migrant or speaks with a foreign accent - whether they have the right documentation or not - for fear of incurring a \u00a33,000 fine if they provide accommodation to \"illegal immigrants\". Just how complex it is can be judged from the 89-page guidance given to employers to enable them to check the status of job applicants.\n\nMany people who have been given the right to remain in the UK often do not have their documentation available because it has been lodged with the Home Office - a body notorious for sitting on papers. Those turned away will resort to finding accommodation from rogue landlords, increasing the scandal of \"beds in sheds\". Racial discrimination will increase.\n\nWhat will the NHS measures mean?\n\nFollowing outlandish figures provided by the aptly named Creative Research that suggests migrants are burying their noses in a trough of NHS free care, the government proposes to charge undocumented migrants whenever they use NHS services. It also proposes that people who come to the UK to stay for six to 12 months pay \u00a3200 upon their arrival.\n\nThis means already overworked NHS staff, and particularly administrative staff at GPs' surgeries, will face the task of judging whether or not a migrant should be charged for any care they receive. Even worse, many migrants - both documented and undocumented - are liable to stop seeking NHS care as a result of the measures, increasing their own vulnerability to illness. Racial discrimination will increase.\n\nWhat will measures regarding driving licences and bank accounts mean?\n\nAgain DVLA staff and bank tellers will be tasked with acting like border guards, demanding that anyone who looks or speaks like a migrant provides documentation before serving them. Racial discrimination will increase.\n\nWhat will measures to restrict rights to appeal and bail mean?\n\nThe government proposes to cut the 17 current immigration decisions that can be appealed to four. Even worse, it proposes to stop migrants appealing against their deportation, claiming any further legal process be carried out from the country to which they are deported. This will hit migrants seeking to appeal against erroneous immigration decisions.\n\nJust how erroneous is highlighted by the fact that nearly 50 percent of the appeals last year against Home Office decisions regarding rights to remain in the UK were successful, as were 32 percent of appeals against deportation. The figures are not surprising given just how complex immigration law has become over the past 20 years of successive governments - both Tory and Labour - continually upping the ante on immigrants and asylum seekers.\n\nIn a further nasty twist, the government also proposes to reduce the scope of the Human Rights legislation by incorporating into the bill an \"understanding\" that judges give \"little weight\" to migrants' appeals on the basis of their family life in the UK. This means there will be more cases of husbands and fathers being deported, leaving their wives and children behind in this country.\n\nGiven the above, what is the true aim of the bill?\n\nWith the anti-immigrant Ukip threatening to damage significantly the electoral chances of all three mainstream political parties, the true aim of the bill is to create a \"hostile environment\" not just for illegal immigrants, but for all migrants and anyone who looks or speaks like a migrant. And given that migrants are normally presented in the media as either black or Asian, the bill will increase anti-black racism and Islamophobia.\n\nNor will it stop \"illegal\" immigration. As the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants says: \"Most of the measures will not serve to reduce the numbers of undocumented entrants coming to the UK nor will they serve to force people already here to leave, because desperate people who choose to come here in a clandestine way do not do so for the lure of a driving licence or the prospect of signing a tenancy. They live under the radar of the authority.\"",

        "text":"How do we remember what came before? How is our history reflected in our modern life? Preserving history means something different to everyone.\n\nIn America, historical preservation usually means conserving buildings. Yet what often gets protected reflects a tiny component of society (usually the rich and famous), leaving out the average Joes and Josephines.\n\nHistory is also preserved by putting special treasures under glass or in an exhibit, or saving special papers, photographs and family reminiscences. They all have their place and contribute to a better understanding of what came before.\n\nHowever, I believe the best way of preserving the knowledge and wisdom of our elders is by asking them. Oral histories give us a window into the soul of a community, family or individual and their connections through the chain of generations.\n\nAlthough everyone has biases based on their own experiences, oral histories compiled with hundreds of their contemporaries offer us a powerfully insightful view of the past \u2014 how people lived their lives, what food they ate, how they celebrated, how they mourned, what they valued, their fondest memories and their deepest regrets.\n\nThese memories not only make yesterday live again, but they create a treasure map to help us find our way home.\n\nI started interviewing my grandparents as a child and learned early on about the power of oral history. Since then, wherever I've lived, I started an oral history project so my communities would never lose their history.\n\nThat was my main impetus for founding the Center for Cultural Preservation seven years ago to be sure those voices of our elders would never be stilled. Of the 400-plus oral histories I've collected over the years, many of them are elders in our community.\n\nThese interviews include people like Gladys Barnwell, the dear heart and soul of the Curb Market and the founder with her husband of one of the oldest apple orchards in Henderson County.\n\nIt includes Theron Maybin, the agricultural steward of the Green River Valley whose farming wisdom was a fountain of knowledge for many.\n\nThe collection includes molasses makers, moonshiners, balladeers, textile workers, Cherokee elders, African-American farmers, survivors of great floods, and so much more. They form an incredible mosaic of stories of resilience, of family and community, faith and interconnectedness, of joy and hardship and of lives lived well and purposefully.\n\nWhen I leave an interview with a local elder, I always feel that I've been blessed to have interviewed a very wealthy man or woman. They may have not had two nickels to rub together for most of their life, but the wealth of their knowledge and experiences provides an incredible example for future generations, including our own.\n\nNow that the Center for Cultural Preservation has accumulated these fantastic treasures, I realize the most important thing is to preserve and distribute them as widely as possible.\n\nWe've made a number of well-received documentary films based on these interviews, and we've provided education in the schools and to the public at large. But unless we preserve these interviews and make them accessible to students, teachers and anyone who wants to learn about Southern Appalachian history, all of that work and all of those gems that were mined will be for naught.\n\nMy goal in the next couple of years is to have these oral histories accessible through the internet but also at great institutions in our region, throughout the state and the country. Half a dozen institutions in North Carolina and the Library of Congress in Washington have agreed to become repositories for these interviews.\n\nNow the hard work begins to digitize and create an archive of these interviews that were originally produced in a variety of formats, from reel-to-reel tape, to old-style video, to more recent 4K cinema video.\n\nIn time, this treasure chest of oral histories will be available for anyone to watch anytime, preserving our history forever. Developing this rich archive will only be possible with the support of individuals and businesses who believe in the value of keeping this history alive and making it sing for our children and their children.\n\nIn addition to preserving this valuable archive, the Center for Cultural Preservation has begun working on a new documentary film on the history of moonshining in the mountains. The center has launched a fundraising campaign to raise the initial $100,000 we\u2019ll need to get this project off the ground.\n\nThis holiday season, I hope you\u2019ll consider supporting our work by contributing any amount, large or small, to the center through our website, SaveCulture.org, or by mailing your check to: The Center for Cultural Preservation, P.O. Box 1066, Flat Rock, N.C. Thank you!\n\nDavid Weintraub is a cultural preservationist and environmental troublemaker who runs the Center for Cultural Preservation.
