        "text":"Occult America: White House Seances, Ouija Circles, Masons, and the Secret Mystic History of Our Nation (Paperback)\n\nOccult America: White House Seances, Ouija Circles, Masons, and the Secret Mystic History of Our Nation Cover Image\nUsually Ships in 1-5 Days\n\n\nFrom its earliest days, America served as an arena for the revolutions in alternative spirituality that eventually swept the globe. Esoteric philosophies and personas--from Freemasonry to Spiritualism, from Madame H. P. Blavatsky to Edgar Cayce--dramatically altered the nation's culture, politics, and religion. Yet the mystical roots of our identity are often ignored or overlooked. Opening a new window on the past, Occult America presents a dramatic, pioneering study of the esoteric undercurrents of our history and their profound impact across modern life.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMitch Horowitz is the editor in chief of Tarcher\/Penguin. He has written for Esopus, Parabola, Fortean Times, and Science of Mind. A well-known voice for occult and esoteric ideas, Horowitz lives in New York City with his wife and two children. From the Hardcover edition.\n\nPraise For\u2026\n\n\"What a fascinating book. So it happens that another equally compelling take on our complicated national narrative lies just beneath the surface of things; not the grand procession of presidents, generals, and wars, but something more hidden, more mysterious, but often no less revealing.\"\u2014Ken Burns\n\n\u201cInvisible and mysterious forces have shaped and guided the destiny of individuals and nations throughout history. From Moses to Gandhi, Jesus to Muhammad, Lincoln to Obama, hidden dimensions, in both our personal and collective consciousness, were conceiving, constructing, and shaping the course of civilization. In his precise and often detailed history of mysticism in America, Mitch Horowitz, has, in a way, tracked the evolution of our consciousness over 300 years.\u201d \u2014Deepak Chopra\n\n\u00a0\"A sparkling, down-to-earth and often deeply touching account of a powerful, much misunderstood force in the formation of America's cultural and spiritual identity.\" \u2014Jacob Needleman, author of The American Soul and The New Religions.\"\n\nOccult America is a truly remarkable achievement. Exhaustively researched, it takes the reader from the early concepts of the supernatural, personified by Mother Ann Lee, Joseph Smith, and Madame Blavatsky, through such modern-day figures as Henry A. Wallace and Norman Vincent Peale. It opens the eyes of the relatively uninitiated, in which I include myself, to the effect the occult has had, is having, and will have on the American experience.\u201d \u2014John S.D. Eisenhower, author of The Bitter Woods: The Battle of the Bulge and So Far From God: The U.S. War with Mexico, 1846-1848\n\n\"Religious people tend to be afraid of the word occult. Horowitz examines this aspect of life and religion in penetrating ways...and revealing its not unsubstantial influence on mainline Christianity. Truth seekers have always come from the edges. Religion itself should be glad they do.\" \u2014John Shelby Spong, author of Jesus for the Non-Religious\n\n\"This book is a delightfully original tour through American history, as seen through the lives of men and women devoted to all manner of mysticism. Across these pages troop spiritualists, prophets, seers, psychics, numerologists, transcendentalists, theosophists, and historical figures from Mary Todd Lincoln to Marcus Garvey to Henry Wallace. Their stories are part of the deep-seated American tradition of searching for the new\u2014a tradition that Occult America both explains and enriches.\" \u2014 Stephen Kinzer, author of Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq and All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror\n\u00a0\u201cFascinating\u2026Occult America is a serious, wide-ranging study of all the magical, mystical, and spiritual movements that have arisen and influenced American history in often-surprising ways.\u201d \u2014Washington Post Book World Podcast\nOccult America treats esoteric ideas and movements with an even-handed intellectual studiousness that is too often lost in today's raised-voice discussions about religion and belief systems.\u201d\u00a0 \u2014Washington Post Express\n\u201cOne of the most readable histories of American mysticism ever written\u2026This is historical reporting that is crafted so well, it holds the reader much like a Voodoo spell.\u201d\u2014Tucson Citizen\n\u201cHorowitz teases out fascinating stories of the \u2018dreamers and planners who flourished along the Psychic Highway\u2019\u2026In showing how the paths of these figures occasionally intersected with the likes of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Horowitz argues that the influence of the occult extends beyond the s\u00e9ance room and into the mainstream of American thought.\u201d \u2014Washington Post Book World\n\n\u201cA brilliant job of tracking down how positive thinker Norman Vincent Peale borrowed his core self-help philosophy from a religious movement called New Thought.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Washington Times\n\n\u201cExhaustively researched and written in a very accessible style...Occult America fills a gap in the knowledge of religion for most people.\u201d \u2014Huntington News, VA\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d \u2014Library Journal\n\u201cOne of the best recent books on patterns of belief.\u201d \u2014Fortean Times\n\u201cA fantastic tour guide to the fringes of reason, high weirdness, deep esoterica, secret societies, and mystery religions.\u201d \u2014Boing Boing\n\n\u201cEmploying extensive research while writing with an authoritative tone, Horowitz succeeds in showing how a \u2018new spiritual culture\u2019 developed in America.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly\n\nProduct Details\nISBN: 9780553385151\nISBN-10: 0553385151\nPublisher: Bantam\nPublication Date: October 5th, 2010\nPages: 304\nLanguage: English",

It has not only helped us identify areas of weakness that have limited our growth, but it has also provided us with practical steps and useful signposts for breaking through. Pastor Hal is a wise, bubbly, inspirational communicator who has helped aid both CLC\u2019s growth and my own personal growth, an area that I wasn\u2019t really giving enough attention to. I\u2019m so glad that I signed up and am looking forward to combing through the teaching again to deepen my learning and strengthen our application. I highly recommend the investment for other pastors that are seeking to go and grow to the next level!\u201d Pastor Dan Harman, City Life Church Portsmouth, ENGLAND\n    Pastor Dan Harman, City Life Church Portsmouth, ENGLAND\n  \u2022 Shawn Beaty, Lead Pastor of Clovis Hills Community Church, Clovis, CA\n    \"The questions I always ask when it comes to receiving coaching are always will it work? Is it worth it? Do I have time?\u00a0 I would suggest that a pastor can't afford not to get a coach. Hal Seed's practical, godly coaching has helped me break multiple\u00a0numerical and spiritual growth barriers in my ministry. If you want to grow as a leader and see the Kingdom grow you can't afford NOT to invest in a coaching network like this.\" Shawn Beaty, Lead Pastor of Clovis Hills Community Church, Clovis, CA\n    Shawn Beaty, Lead Pastor of Clovis Hills Community Church, Clovis, CA\n\nValue that Exceeds your Expectations\n\nFull Price: $997\u00a0\nGet 67% Off for a Limited Time\n\n$27 monthly\n\n62 Video Lessons\n\n91 Downloadable Resources\n\n52 Sunday Afternoon Emails\n\nImmediate and Life-time Access\n\n$297 once\n\n62 Video Lessons\n\n91 Downloadable Resources\n\n52 Sunday Afternoon Emails\n\nImmediate and Life-time Access\n\n30-Day Money-Back Guarantee\n\nIs there a No-Risk Guarantee?\n\nAbsolutely.

And we've even set it up so you can make monthly payments of just $27 for 12 months. (Total cost: $324) If one person joins your church in the next year and starts to give, they will easily cover the cost.\u00a0 The real question is: can you afford for things to stay the way they are?\n\n  \u2022 What if I don't have time to work on it?\n\n    We get that. It's always difficult to find time to work on the organization, not just in it. For your church to grow, you need to make some time each week to build improvements into the fabric\u00a0of your church. As your church gets better at some things, you will find more time for new\u00a0things.\n\n  \u2022 Who is ChurchEngines for?\n\n    It is for pastors who want to see people come to Christ and to see their churches grow. It's for churches that are open to newcomers and to new believers. ChurchEngines is for churches that want to grow.\n\n  \u2022 What if I'm not sure we can do the work, make the improvements, and see a difference?\n\n    We are confident that you can. You will build on what you already have in your church, taking the next steps and seeing growth and improvements build layer upon layer. Over 100 churches have been mentored by Hal, and we hear story after story from pastors who are encouraged by new life and growth in their church.\n\n  \u2022 What if this isn't the right plan for our church?\n\n    This is the only mentoring experience for pastors, taught by a church planting, multi-site lead pastor with a doctorate in ministry, from a church with a huge heart for evangelism; that includes video teaching, a complete network of downloads, and a weekly email check-in. The value, really, is unparalleled.\n\nJoin Hal for learning and growth today!\n\nGet started on this new opportunity to lead a better, bigger church.\n\n$27 monthly\n\n12 Monthly Auto-Payments by Credit Card\n\n\n$297 once\n\nOne Payment by Credit Card\n\nFor Me",
