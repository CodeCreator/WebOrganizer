        "text":"quesCan daughter claim share in ancestral property?\n\nMy grandfather executed a WILL in the form of a notary which was not registered. This property was ancestral. He had 2 sons and a daughter. The property according to the notary was divided between the two sons who've been enjoying these property for 10 years now. The property was further divided amoung their children. Recently, the daughter sent a notice claiming that she was not given any share in the property. She got married 40 years back and is well settled. Does she have a right to oppose the WILL now?\n\n  \u2022 ansIt is always advisable to probate the WILL. It is a judicial proof that the WILL is genuine. Your grand father could only have bequeathed a self acquired property by WILL. For ancestral properties, your grand father could only have bequeathed his share.\n\n    The daughter can claim the share in property since it is ancestral and she has a right in it.

Thanks for your question.\n\nLEGALLY speaking, it is illegal to use a copyrighted work for personal gain without getting permission from the owner of the copyright. Thus, this would likely be illegal. Here's a good link you could read:\n\nObviously, the likelihood of actually getting caught doing this and even being sued is slim because the cost of pursuing a legal claim probably outweighs the money damages that could result, BUT that doesn't mean it's legal and it certainly doesn't mean that you won't get sued; however, the odds are low.\n\nThat said, you can likely get a license to use the song for a nominal fee, and then you won't have to worry about getting sued over the issue. You can contact the US Copyright Office or visit the website and look up the song to see who the copyright owner is; then you can contact the owner about getting a license.\n\nRoger and 2 other Intellectual Property Law Specialists are ready to help you\n\nRelated Intellectual Property Law Questions",

        "text":"Skip to main content\n\nMarried 23 years and am very unhappy. I want a divorce but dont know if I can make it on my own. Where do I begin?\n\nMonterey, CA |\n\nWe have 2 kids and I stay home. He makes about $130,000 a year.We own a home.If I divorce him how much will I recieve? Will I be able to stay on his health coverage? He handles all the finances so I'm not able to \"hide\" money to get myself started. Where do I begin?\n\nAttorney Answers 2\n\n\nI would suggest that you begin by consulting with a well qualified family law attorney. If you need to pay a fee for the consultation, you might want to do so in cash so that your spouse does not get notice of that meeting.\n\nAll that I can tell you is that you are in a long term marriage and you will most likely receive spousal support for an indefinite period of time. A person cannot place their ex spouse on the medical coverage. Therefore, if you divorce, you will need to obtain your own medical insurance. If you are somehow uninsurable because of pre-existing medical conditions, you might want to get a legal separation instead of a divorce.\n\nThe child support will last until the youngest child is 18 AND graduates from high school OR 19 years of age, whichever first occurs.\n\nI have been answering many questions on AVVO and giving my opinion of what will occur if a matter went before a judicial officer based upon the facts as I understand them. However, I want to point out that such an opinion is based upon many factors, not the least of which is that the party have an experienced family law attorney representing them on the matter. If facts and issues of law are not properly placed before the court, the results could be very different than otherwise expected.\n\nThe response given is not intended to create, nor does it create an ongoing duty to respond to questions. The response does not form an attorney-client relationship, nor is it intended to be anything other than the educated opinion of the author. It should not be relied upon as legal advice. The response given is based upon the limited facts provided by the person asking the question. To the extent additional or different facts exist, the response might possibly change.\n\nMark as helpful\n\n1 found this helpful\n\n\nYou should absolutely begin by consulting with a family law attorney, and possibly several attorneys if you are at all uncomfortable at your first meeting.\n\nYour questions can and should all be answered in much more detail than I can provide you based on the limited information in front of me, but I shall do my best to at least give you some idea of what you can expect in a divorce.\n\nCalifornia is what is known as a community property state, which means, in a very simplified version, that all assets acquired during marriage, regardless of whether earned or purchased by you our your husband, are presumed to be equally shared between the two of you. For example, if you bought your house during the marriage, it's very likely both yours, and if you were to sell it, the equity would be divided equally. If your husband has a pension or a retirement, you are entitled to one-half the community interest (not the same as 1\/2 of the entire plan, but it will likely be very close to half). If you have credit card debt, each of you is obligated for one-half of the amount.\n\nAs to whether or not you can stay on his health coverage, so long as the divorce proceedings are still going on, he is required to keep you on his plan. After the divorce is finalized, you will have to provide your own insurance, although you will likely be eligible for COBRA coverage.\n\nChild support (if either child is 18 or younger and still a high school student) is based on two factors: each parent's income and the amount of time the child(ren) spend(s) with each parent. Spousal support is divided into temporary and permanent support, better referred to as \"pre-divorce\" and \"post-divorce\" support. Support while your divorce is pending (temporary support) is based on income. Support after your judgment (permanent support) is based on 14 different factors.\n\nA family law attorney can help you plan for your divorce and set you up the best way possible financially.

        "text":"Skip to main content\n\nWhen can I get my license back? 2nd DUI.\n\nParamount, CA |\n\nI just got my license suspended for 2 years from the DMV, which started in Jan 2012. I went to court already and got 96 hrs. in jail and was told to enroll in an 18 month alcohol program. The judge didn't say anything about a license suspension, but not to drive w\/o a valid license. I have reseached about the suspension and found out that 1 year of the suspension is a \"hard\" suspension. I also came across SB 598. Exactly how can this recently passed law help me get a license to get to work, school and the court affiliated obligations I must do? What would be the fastest way to get driving again?\n\nI refused the test, because I was not pulled over. I was arrested at home well over an hour after I had last drove.\n\n+ Read More\n\nAttorney answers 2\n\n\nWhile I'm sure that you are not feeling that lucky, if it had to happen you picked a good year! Whereas it would normally be one year before you could be licensed, this year you are able to apply for a license after serving 3 months of the suspension. This will be resolved between you, the DMV, and an car interlock device company. You will probably be contacted by DMV and notified of this procedure, but if not go to the DMV after having served three months of the suspension. With the IID installed in your vehicle you will be able to drive again so long as the device does not detect alcohol. What I have told you assumes a \"normal' DUI, no refusal, and no DUI probation violation. At least this will help get you started. Also the license is unrestricted. George\n\n\n\nmay i ask? I asked the DMV hearing officer if I can apply for a restricted and he said no. Not with a 2nd, Period. I mentioned I live alone, only supporter of my income to keep home etc No metro in my area (rural) so it IS possible? riverside co. ca. tks\n\n\nIt is not uncommon for the DMV to issue a restricted license to allow an offender an opportunity to drive to work, school and for necessities such as medical care.\n\nYou should contact the lawyer who handled your DUI case for further information. Also, at the very least you can go into DMV with proof of insurance and inquire if you pay the required fee whether you are eligible for a restricted license.\n\nOne thing for sure, do not ever get into a car after having any alcohol, even a gklas of wine or a can of beer. If you are stopped by an officer, he will no doubt smell alcohol once you roll down the window or open the door. That will begin the field test and the chance of being charged with another DUI, something you do not want to happen again.\n\nLastly, if you apply for a professional state Board license or have one, you will have to disclose this conviction, even if later dismissed (expunged). Most employers also have applications that require an answer to whether a prospective employee has ever had a conviction. If you do not answer the questions truthfully, the consequences can be even more severe.\n\nGet Avvo\u2019s 3-part DUI email series\n\nA roundup of the best tips and legal advice.\n\nDUI topics\n\nRecommended articles about DUI\n\nWhat others are asking\n\nCan't find what you're looking for?\n\nPost a free question on our public forum.\n\nAsk a Question\n\n- or -\n\nSearch for lawyers by reviews and ratings.\n\nFind a Lawyer",

This doesn\u2019t affect rankings. Our review process.\n\nThe term identity theft gets thrown around so liberally, and it\u2019s frustrating to me, because a person\u2019s \u201cidentity\u201d comprises so many variables that people don\u2019t immediately realize. The dictionary defines identity theft as \u201cthe fraudulent acquisition and use of a person\u2019s private identifying information, usually for financial gain,\u201d but I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s an outdated definition. To clear the air (and to help me prepare for my social studies class), could you guys provide me with what you would consider to be the meaning of\u00a0 ID theft? Much obliged, and for the record I consider you guys to be the experts on this particular topic \ud83d\ude42\n\n-Josh V\n\n\nThe dictionary definition is correct, but you\u2019re right it\u2019s somewhat broad. We would define identity theft (or conversely identity fraud) as a crime in which an individual posing as someone else takes advantage of one or more sensitive and personally identifiable pieces of information (such as a date of birth, address, social security number, driver\u2019s license number, etc.) in order to impersonate that other individual. The key here is\u00a0impersonate, since the resulting crime can only be successful if they fool people into thinking they\u2019re someone they\u2019re not. The crimes that result from this, as you may guess, become more numerous as we rely more on technological advances. The balance between the benefits technology provides, and privacy it takes away from us, becomes more precarious the more comfortable our lives become.\n\n-Alex, Safe Smart Living\n\nKnow the answer?

If he doesn't comply, then the Sheriff has the right to forcibly evict him. Additionally, under these circumstances (unless he has a lease) it would seem that you might be entitled to have him pay your legal fees, and definitely your filing fees.

They advised, then, they'll ship as soon as payment is received. In November 99, we placed an order, sent them full payment in advance. They, then, advised they have a delay and promised shipping to take place Jan. 2000. In Jan., they advised they won't be able to ship before May. In May they advised that shipment is now ready to go, they just need a new check since the one they have is too old. We sent a new one, they stopped replying to us till a few days ago when they sent us a fax advising they won't be able to ship since they do not have the parts requested, and that they'll be returning the check back to us. I wonder if there's any legal action that can be taken against them since we committed to supply those parts to a government authority through a tender. Now, we are facing delay penalty in addition to the fact that we'll have to supply the parts no matter what; we'll be buying them locally at a high price. We also spent a lot of money on phone calls, plus multiple bank fees to issue them checks twice.\n\nAsked on 7\/25\/00, 4:33 pm\n\n2 Answers from Attorneys\n\nGerald Hershenson Law Office of Gerald M. Hershenson\n\nRe: Claim\n\nYou have a valid claim. Documents have to be reviewed. However, you did not mention whether the check was cashed or returned. This company clearly caused a delay and would be responsible for any damages. The question that needs to be addressed is to determine whether the company is responsible financially to pay any judgement. I suggest that you immediately follow through with collection of this claim. Unfortunately a lot of time has passed since your message was posted. You need to consult with American legal counsel immediately.\n\nRead more\nAnswered on 9\/12\/00, 5:06 pm\nDaniel Press Chung & Press, P.C.\n\nRe: Claim\n\nYou have a claim for breach of contract for the difference between the amount you agreed to pay the supplier and what you have to pay to acquire the parts (plus the amount of the check if it was cashed). You need to make a reasonable effort to shop around for the lowest price reasonably available to obtain the parts, but that will almost certainly be higher than your agreed price due to the short notice. You should obtain counsel in the U.S. in the state where the seller is located, and act fast in case they are insolvent.\n\nRead more\nAnswered on 9\/12\/00, 6:34 pm\n\nRelated Questions & Answers\n\n    A PHP Error was encountered\n\n    Severity: Warning\n\n    Message: Invalid argument supplied for foreach()\n\n    Filename: views\/new_publicquestionview.php\n\n    Line Number: 154\n\nMore Business Law questions and answers in Egypt",

I plan on getting married late July in Algeria. However, I am not sure if it makes more sense to legally get married there then petition for a green card or petition for a fianc\u00e9 visa then do the legal part here in the USA. I want to proceed with the fastest option.Thank you,Moncef\nExpert:\u00a0 Ely replied\u00a01 year ago.\n\nWell, either process takes about 6 months, but marrying abroad (as you already seem to want to do) is less paperwork and cost, so let us go with this.\n\nThis involves filing for an I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative). You can see STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS and what documents to file HERE.\n\nThe I-130 application itself may be found HERE.\n\nI hope this helps and clarifies.

I work very hard to formulate an informative and honest answer for you; please reciprocate my good faith.\n\nCustomer: replied\u00a01 year ago.\nDoes the six month period start after July? Or can the I-130 be filed before getting married aboard. I would like her to move here after the wedding in July. If I start the process for the fianc\u00e9 visa, does that mean she can have the visa six months from now then it is just a matter of changing status once she is here?Thank you,Moncef\nExpert:\u00a0 Ely replied\u00a01 year ago.\n\nSix months is an estimate, it begins when you file the I-130.\n\nThe I-130 cannot be filed before you are married.\n\nIf you go the fiance route, you would petition for her fiance visa (HERE), get her to come over (about 6 months wait), and then file for her greencard with the I-130 after marriage (HERE).\n\nGentle Reminder: Please, use the REPLY or SEND button to keep chatting, or rate positively and SUBMIT your rating when we are finished.

No you cannot just add the new guy to the birth certificate. I suggest you review the link I sent and set up a consultation with a FAMILY LAW attorney.\n\n    You can Google Family Law attorney's in your zip code, and get a fairly good list to go through, or get a list of legal aid attorneys near you, or visit your local courthouse, to see what you may be up against as far as forms, filing fees, times and dates. Then you can decide how best to proceed.

        "text":"A few days ago, an editor at Vice tweeted a photo of what appears to be a CBP or ICE agent inspecting the documentation of individual passengers disembarking a flight. The caption states that it was a domestic flight from San Francisco to JFK, and that passengers \"were told we couldn't disembark without showing our 'documents'\". This has caused a bit of a splash, with some questioning the legality and prudence of the action.\n\nI fly domestically quite frequently. In the event that I encounter a similar situation, I wish to know my own rights and to be able to inform other passengers of theirs.\n\nI am only interested in the narrow case defined above, in which everyone on a domestic flight is asked to show documents before deplaning. Assume that I am flying for travel rather than immigration, and that I have not committed any immigration or travel violations.\n\n  \u2022 Do I have the right to refuse compliance if asked for documentation?\n  \u2022 Can officials in this situation detain or arrest me solely for refusing to comply or failing to produce documentation?\n  \u2022 Are there possible long-term consequences if I refuse to comply, but otherwise have done nothing wrong?\n\nI understand that immigration officials generally require probably cause to stop or detain someone, but have jurisdiction to detain someone who cannot demonstrate legal status at border crossings (source). I understand that this jurisdiction generally applies at airports for international arrivals. My question is whether it also can apply at an impromptu checkpoint for domestic travelers attempting to deplane.\n\n  \u2022 1\n    @Dorothy Please don't post answers as comments. If you have the time to look up the precise section of US law that covers the situation, surely you have time to write it in the answer box with a little bit of formatting. \u2013\u00a0David Richerby Feb 25 '17 at 17:04\n  \u2022 5\n    I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because we are not lawyers. This we can not answer. You need to ask the ACLU. Are you ready to risk being jailed based on the ramblings of a few random strangers off the Internet?? \u2013\u00a0chx Feb 25 '17 at 17:27\n  \u2022 2\n    @phoog nothing of the sort. In this case I would want an opinion from a lawyer who is ready to fight for that opinion at the airport where I get jailed when the CBP\/ICE is of a differing opinion. \u2013\u00a0chx Feb 25 '17 at 17:31\n  \u2022 7\n    @chx from meta: \"Customs and immigration laws that deal with travelers rather than immigrants would also be on topic.\" Anecdotally, it certainly seems like a lot of questions here ask about the legal nuances of customs, border, and immigration law and how to navigate the system. And my understanding is that just because a question is on-topic on one stack doesn't necessarily make it off-topic on another. \u2013\u00a0Joe Feb 25 '17 at 17:34\n  \u2022 4\n    @chx and other close voters: I strenuously object to the idea that this is off topic. We have many questions about legal rights at fixed passport control checkpoints, customs checkpoints, and security checkpoints. Why should it be different if the question instead concerns a temporary checkpoint or other investigation? \u2013\u00a0phoog Feb 25 '17 at 18:34\n\nConstitutional law professor Garrett Epps has covered this incident in an article for the Atlantic. He concludes that by law, an agent in this situation should allow passengers who refuse to comply to pass.\n\nBased on his research, Epps concludes that officials lack the authority to perform mandatory check of every passenger:\n\nAfter days of research, I can find no legal authority for ICE or CBP to require passengers to show identification on an entirely domestic fight. The ICE authorizing statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357, provides that agents can conduct warrantless searches of \u201cany person seeking admission to the United States\u201d\u2014if, that is, the officer has \u201creasonable cause to suspect\u201d that the individual searched may be deportable. CBP\u2019s statute, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1467, grants search authority \u201cwhenever a vessel from a foreign port or place or from a port or place in any Territory or possession of the United States arrives at a port or place in the United States.\u201d CBP regulations, set out at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 162.6, allow agents to search \u201cpersons, baggage, and merchandise arriving in the Customs territory of the United States from places outside thereof.\u201d\n\nEpps further writes that \"I asked two experts whether I had missed some general exception to the Fourth Amendment for passengers on a domestic flight\", and quotes them in the piece agreeing that a mandatory check would not be legal, and that there is no exception for domestic aviation.\n\nEpps also reached out to CPB, who are quoted claiming that the incident did not constitute a mandatory check, but a request for \"consensual assistance\":\n\nIn this situation, CBP was assisting ICE in locating an individual possibly aboard the flight that was ordered removed from the United States pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act. To assist ICE, CBP requested consensual assistance from passengers aboard the flight to determine whether the removable individual in question was in fact aboard the flight. In the course of seeking this assistance, CBP did not compel any of these domestic passengers to show identification. With much-appreciated cooperation from these passengers, CBP was able to resolve the issue with minimal delay to the traveling public.\n\nEpps notes that such requests for \"voluntary cooperation\" are perfectly legal, even if the officers involved block an exit, ask for documents, and do not tell anyone that they are not legally required to comply.\n\nAt the end of the article, Epps concludes that passengers should be able to pass without complying, but suggests that there a degree of risk in doing so:\n\nI have researched the matter, and feel reasonably confident that an agent would have to let me pass if I refused the demand for my papers. If not, I can afford counsel and my family knows excellent lawyers to call.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n  \u2022 2\n    In New York, they could rely on US v. Martinez Fuerte, because it's less than 100 miles from the coastal border (indeed, JFK is on Jamaica Bay, which connects to the Atlantic around Rockaway Point), but perhaps they wouldn't want to because a challenge might induce a court to narrow the applicability of the earlier ruling. If they actually had information that a given person was aboard the aircraft, though, couldn't they could require people to identify themselves until they found that person? Would they then be exceeding their authority if they looked into others' immigration status? \u2013\u00a0phoog Feb 28 '17 at 4:37\n  \u2022 2\n    Given that they asked for identification from passengers who could not possibly be the alleged target of the dragnet, I am inclined to view this as an ex post factor pretext. As far as the 100-mile zone, I think the problem is these passengers clearly embarked from somewhere else in the USA. It isn't like looking for improper land border-crossers. I agree CPB probably doesn't want to test this, as they could easily lose. \u2013\u00a0Andrew Lazarus Feb 28 '17 at 8:06\n  \u2022 2\n    @AndrewLazarus with respect to the 100-mile zone, it doesn't matter whether the passengers embarked elsewhere in the USA. It possibly should matter, but it doesn't. Border Patrol has in the past routinely searched buses and trains on domestic routes. There's no reason to think they'd treat airplanes any differently. (And, in this case, the flight originated in the 100-mile zone, so there's no way to say that one of the passengers didn't sail into SF bay without immigration inspection and then board the plane. Highly unlikely, but possible enough for the legal justification.) \u2013\u00a0phoog Mar 4 '17 at 3:08\n  \u2022 1\n    @phoog Is there any case law on domestic flights? It's obvious that a land border crosser could hop a bus as well as go in a private vehicle. But the law ties the zone to suspicion of illegal entry, and that would be a stretch for a flight. For surface transportation, still being near the border is significant. For the destination airport, it isn't. Papers, please! \u2013\u00a0Andrew Lazarus Mar 4 '17 at 6:02\n  \u2022 1\n    @AndrewLazarus the act provides this power \"for the purpose of patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States\"; it does not mention suspicion. In practice, the courts have upheld Border Patrol checkpoints even though they hardly catch anyone who has recently crossed the border illegally. FYI, the executive branch has defined some statutory terms by regulation at 8 CFR 287.1. \u2013\u00a0phoog Mar 4 '17 at 6:29\n\nDo I have the right to refuse compliance if asked for documentation?\n\nYou have a fifth-amendment right against incriminating yourself, so you can refuse to comply. However, depending on the legal authority for checking your ID, the officers can probably detain you until they've determined your immigration status, or whatever other facts are relevant to their investigation. Under certain circumstances, they can search your person and property, which will most likely give them access to your documents even without your consent.\n\nIf I refuse compliance or cannot produce documentation, can officials detain me at the airport, pull me off a plane that hasn't yet departed, or prevent me from boarding a connecting flight?\n\nYes. If they have probable cause to suspect you of a crime, they can arrest you. If they have reasonable suspicion, they can detain you to investigate that suspicion. In some cases, reasonable suspicion is not required.\n\nAre there possible long-term consequences if I refuse to comply? Are the consequences different if I am a US citizen, a foreign national with a valid visa or green card, or an alien in the country without proper documentation?\n\nThis is immigration enforcement, so of course the long-term consequences depend on your immigration status. If you can prove that are a US citizen, or that you are an alien in compliance with immigration law, there can be no long-term consequences related to... (truncated)",
