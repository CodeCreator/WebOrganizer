        "text":"Boldly Go Where the Keyboard Shortcuts Really Are\n\nI corocketme from the Flintstone age; I learned to type on an IBM Selectric typewriter. When I moved to computers, mice were obnoxious to me because I was used to doing everything without ever having to take my hands off the keyboard. Nowadays, shortcuts are built into every program you use. However, they often still take several keys or steps to reach a goal.\n\nI learned how to reassign some tasks to keys I wasn\u2019t using; like the \u2018F\u2019 Keys. Reassigning keys is easy, however, it only applies to the application you reassign keys in \u2013 in this case Word. It is not the same as remapping keys. For common things like bolding text though, it works for me in a pinch. And when I\u2019m writing a lot of user documentation, I\u2019m bolding a lot. Even though Windows 7 offers the shadow editing box when you highlight text, I found an even faster way to bold multiple items and you don\u2019t need to highlight the text, you just have to be on it.\n\n  1. Open Word.\u00a0 Click the Office button and select Word Options.\n\nWindows Button_Word Options\n\n  1. Click Customize on the left column, go to the bottom of the window next to Keyboard Shortcuts and click Customize\n\n.Customize_Kbrd Shortucts Customize\n\n  1. In the next window you will be locating the shortcut you want to assign to a key on your keyboard.\u00a0 Under Categories find the corresponding tab in Word and then find the command (such as Bold) that you would like to assign to a key.\n\nHome Tab_Bold\n\n  1. Under Press New Shortcut Key \u2013 press the key you would like to use.\u00a0 I chose F12. NOTE: If Windows can\u2019t assign that key, it won\u2019t show up in the box. Don\u2019t use keys that are normally assigned to something you use for other things \u2013 it will lead to problems later. Use those lonely F Keys.\n  1. Click Assign>Close>OK. The handy thing about using the F12 Key for Bold is that you no longer have to double click to highlight the word you want to bold. You just click once inside the word and then hit the shortcut key. Bam. Bingo. Bold.\n\nNOTE: You can use this process for other things besides Bold.\n\n2 thoughts on \u201cBoldly Go Where the Keyboard Shortcuts Really Are\u201d\n\n  1. You do not have to double click or highlight a word to make it bold. Simply put the cursor anywhere within the word and press Control+B. If I need to highlight a group of words I highlight them with Shift+Control+direction key then press Control+B.\n\n  2. @MichaelKMc: I stand corrected. I think I was thinking about word selection in other apps besides Word, but in this post I am referring to just Word. In any case, while I do use the Ctrl + shortcut keys all the time, I still think clicking on one F key saves time when bolding multiple words at a time. It all depends on what you\u2019re used to, what you like, and how you prefer using a keyboard.\n\nComments are closed.\n\nScroll to Top\n\n\nGet great content like this delivered to your inbox!\n\nIt's free, convenient, and delivered right to your inbox!

Here's a simple guide for website owners who don\u2019t want to lose their Google rankings.\n\nWhat is duplicate content? Here\u2019s a simple guide for website owners who don\u2019t want to lose their Google rankings.\n\nRemember your schooldays?\n\nAll that homework \u2013 man that was a chore! Let\u2019s face it, it was just so much more fun to spend your afternoons playing with your buddies than slaving over books and numbers and essays. Ugh!\n\nWorst of all was studying for tests.\n\nPerhaps you didn\u2019t want to cram for the test, or you simply forgot about it.\n\nAnd then, to try and save the humiliation of a Fail, you tried to copy the answers off the brainbox you\u2019d cunningly sat next to in the exam room.\n\nExcept, of course, the teacher noticed what you\u2019re up to, and you got a far greater humiliation than the Fail. Perhaps you were made an example of, or made to stand out in the corridor. Or you had to see the scary Headmaster. And, of course, your parents would be notified \u2013 horrors!\n\nYou soon learned that copying other kids\u2019 work wasn\u2019t in your best interests.\n\nThe same lesson about copying relates to your website\n\nWhen it comes to your website, copying other people\u2019s content is also a bad idea.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no teacher to punish you, instead there\u2019s Google. (And a punishment from Google, be it a down-graded ranking or total black-listing, is a lot harder and more difficult to recover than even your teacher\u2019s worst punishment.)\n\nWhy does Google punish you for copying?\n\nLet\u2019s look at copying content from Google\u2019s point of view.\n\nThe bottom line is that Google wants to give its users a good search experience. And a good search experience means that people can quickly and easily find the information they\u2019re looking for. Google also wants the information you find to be helpful and meaningful.\n\nWebsite content that\u2019s helpful and meaningful is usually unique: it is a bespoke, one-off article that someone has researched and written.\n\nConversely, low quality content is not so desirable. And over the years, some website owners have tried to \u201ccheat\u201d the Google ranking system by copying other people\u2019s content. And if the internet is full of copies of people\u2019s work, it all gets a bit tedious, spammy and not a very nice or exciting place to be.\n\nGoogle hates spammy websites. And it hates spammy webmasters who copy content from other people. Google would much rather point to the original source of material \u2013 and penalise those who try to copy it. These penalties come in the form of downgrading the rankings of those sites with copied content, or, worse still, removing a website from its search results altogether.\n\nSo what is duplicate content, exactly?\n\nYou get the general idea that duplicate content is not a good thing, but defining \u201cwhat is duplicate content\u201d exactly is a little trickier.\n\nIf you refer to Google\u2019s official advice, there are some tips there (albeit quite technical), but it\u2019s still not crystal clear. So let me explain some of the more common duplicate content problems in practical terms.\n\nBefore I cover common duplicate content problems, one thing you need to be aware of is that duplicate content doesn\u2019t just apply from one website to another, but it also applies to pages on your own website.\n\nThe reason for this is that some spammy webmasters create dozens of pages on the same topic, to try and artificially increase their Google rankings. That doesn\u2019t work any more, because of Google\u2019s dislike of duplicate content.\n\nDoes Google say what percentage they consider duplicate content?\n\nThere are a number of online tools, such as Page Similarity Check Tools, where you put in two website addresses (URLs) and it tells you how similar the pages are as a percentage.\n\nThe problem is that Google doesn\u2019t give a percentage in their guidelines, so these online tools aren\u2019t a whole lot of use!\n\nRather than worry about percentages and other technicalities, here are some practical suggestions on how you can avoid common duplicate content problems.\n\nCommon duplicate content problems \u2013 and how to avoid them\n\nOn a practical level you need to be very careful with the following types of duplicate content:\n\n  \u2022 Mobile versions of your website that have the same content twice. The solution here is for your webmaster to use the \u2018noindex\u2019 meta tag so that the duplicated pages aren\u2019t indexed. (Or better still, build your website so that it\u2019s mobile responsive, and doesn\u2019t need recreating for handheld devices.)\n  \u2022 Printer-only versions of web pages.\u00a0The printer pages should have the \u2018noindex\u2019 tag applied so that these duplicated pages aren\u2019t indexed.\n  \u2022 Similar content that appears across a number of pages. The solution here is to make the copy, order of information and other content as different as possible.\n  \u2022 On e-commerce sites, avoid using the manufacturer\u2019s generic blurb. Chances are that every other re-seller is using the exact same copy, so be unique and write your own product descriptions.\n  \u2022 Syndicate articles carefully. Some people think they\u2019re doing you a favour by \u2018promoting\u2019 you on their website by repeating an article. Wrong! Their site could get penalised for duplicate content \u2013 but so could yours, if Google hasn\u2019t indexed you as being the original source. The way round this is for the other site to use the \u2018noindex\u2019 tag, and to include a link back to your original article. So you can syndicate articles, but do it carefully\u2026 and if the other website owner doesn\u2019t know what a \u2018noindex\u2019 tag is, or they\u2019re not willing to apply it, then don\u2019t do it. (Note: A bigger problem is that some spammy webmasters use \u2018scrapers\u2019 to steal content without your permission. If that happens, you can ask Google to remove the scraped content from their search results.)\n  \u2022 Avoid cheap copywriters. Not all copywriters create unique content; and if you\u2019re buying an article for $5 from someone in India, there\u2019s a good chance that they might have copied someone else\u2019s work. Or they\u2019ve taken someone else\u2019s work, and then put it through a \u2018spinner\u2019 which is an automatic software tool that rewrites content. And yep, Google hates \u2018spun\u2019 content! If you use a quality copywriter, the content will not only be unique, but it will reflect your tone of voice; demonstrate your company\u2019s expertise; and compel readers to buy from you or otherwise take action.\n\nThose are some of the main duplicate content issues I\u2019ve come up against. There are others, too (as listed in the Google article I linked to) but they are there for your web developer to action, rather than a copywriting issue.\n\nAsk your website developer to help you\n\nThe best advice I can give you is to focus on creating unique content, and that your website developer does their part in the programming. Go through the list of action points in Google\u2019s article point by point.\n\nDon\u2019t assume that your web developer knows all this stuff, or will automatically do it: I\u2019ve come across numerous web developers who have never heard of 301 redirects, or will only do them for an extra fee.\n\nRemember that it\u2019s YOUR website and your business at stake, so you have every right to ask questions of your suppliers.\n\nIf you play nicely, you should be fine\n\nJust like schoolteachers punish only the naughty kids, Google only intends to punish those website owners who deliberately engage in deceptive practices. Google doesn\u2019t like people who try to cheat the system and take shortcuts; they\u2019ll be punished, sooner or later.\n\nSo if you focus on creating unique, high quality content for your website (and have a web developer on side who\u2019s clued up in this area), you should be absolutely fine. (And if the worst does happen, and your site gets blacklisted by Google, you can submit your site for reconsideration.)\n\n\nHere are some of the steps you can take so that your website doesn\u2019t suffer from problems with duplicate content:\n\n  \u2022 If there is a separate mobile version of your website, ensure that the \u2018noindex\u2019 tag is used for them.\n  \u2022 If your website has printer-only pages, use the \u2018noindex\u2019 tag for them.\n  \u2022 Avoid using similar content across a number of pages.\n  \u2022 On e-commerce sites, avoid using the manufacturer\u2019s generic blurb and write your own.\n  \u2022 Syndicate articles carefully, and get the other website to use a \u2018noindex\u2019 tag, and also link back to your original article.\n  \u2022 Avoid cheap copywriters who might steal or \u2018spin\u2019 content.\n  \u2022 Ask your web developer which steps they\u2019ve taken to avoid duplicate content issues. Go through the Google article with them as a starting point.\n  \u2022 Focus on creating unique, high quality content for your website.\n\nNeed unique copy for your website?

Watch Instead!\n\nGet The FREE Tool\n\nGet our email updates and get the exact spreadsheet shown in the video above and the post below. It can easily save you hours of work. Data policy.\n\nHow This Works\n\nEssentially, you're going to sort through all of the keywords that your competitors already rank for.\u00a0\n\n\nThey've already done the legwork of creating relevant content. Now, we can use tools to spy on what's driving customers to their business so that we can focus our efforts on the most important terms.\n\nAdding Potential Keywords\n\nThe first thing that we need to do is find out who our search competitors are. To do this, add your \"vanity\" or \"primary\" keyword into Google.\n\nThis should be the term that all of your direct competitors would want to be #1 for. Some examples are\n\n  \u2022 Boston Roofer\n  \u2022 Tampa car accident attorney\n  \u2022 Commercial HVAC Austin\n\nNext, open the websites for all of the businesses that appear on page 1. Don't open directories like Yelp, HomeAdvisor, FindLaw, etc.\n\nIf you're in a more competitive area, then you can grab all the competitors on the top 3 pages.\n\nThen, copy all of the websites into a text document. You can use this chrome extension to copy the URL of all of your open tabs and just remove any irrelevant ones.\u00a0\n\nAfter installing the plugin, make sure that one of your format options says \"URL\"\n\nIf you don't see \"URL\" in any of your 3 format slots, open the extension settings and change one of your formats to \"URL\"\n\nWith all of your competitors pages open, use the \"URL\" option from Copy Tab to copy all of the URLs. Then, paste them into a text document.\n\nNOTE: You can follow this process for as many keywords as you want. You'll get more data, but you'll also make more work for yourself.\n\nOnce you've gone through all your main keywords, found your competitors ranking pages, and added them to a text document - We now want to remove the duplicates.\n\nYou can use a tool like this one to remove all the duplicate lines from your list.\n\nOnce all of your duplicates are removed, paste the entire list under the \"Competitor Page\" header on the \"Add Competitors\" sheet.\n\nIf you don't have an Ahrefs account: Go to Ahrefs.com, can sign up for a 7-day trial for $7 (as of time of writing). \u00a0Tell Tim I sent you so he likes me \ud83d\ude42\n\nDownloading Links\n\nFor each competitor page, click the link under \"keywords link\" to open Ahrefs. You'll be sent to the Organic Keywords report for that URL, showing all keywords Ahrefs has on that page ranking within the top 50.\n\nOn the \"Organic Keywords\" page, click the \"Export\" button. If there are less than 1,000 keywords, then you can use the \"Quick export\". If there are more than 1,000, choose \"Full Export\".\n\nDownload the CSV file.\n\nRepeat this process for all of the competitor websites you found earlier.\n\nOnce you have all of your CSV files, we need to combine them to make importing them into the Google sheet easier.\n\nYou can use this tool to merge all of your CSV files.\n\nOnce you have your merged CSV file, it's time to import it.\n\nOn the \"Import Sheet\" sheet select cell A1. Then, go to File > Import > [Select where you stored the merged CSV file] and select \"Replace data at selected cell.\"\n\nSelecting Keywords\n\nBefore going any further, we need to create our target page sheets.\n\nCreate a list of each \"money page\" or pages that you want to rank. These will most likely be your service pages.\n\nMake a duplicate of the \"Homepage\" sheet and name each new sheet according to your \"money pages.\" Example sheet names could be\n\n  \u2022 Homepage\n  \u2022 Repair\n  \u2022 Car accident\n  \u2022 Lawn care\n\nOn the \"Research\" sheet, we now have a list of all of our competitors keywords (duplicates are automatically removed) as well as their corresponding monthly search volume.\n\nFor each keyword, add a \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the \"Target\" column to indicate whether or not you want to rank for that keyword.\n\nUse filters on the \"Keyword\" column to parse through the list much faster.\n\nAfter all of the keywords have been gone through, filter \"Target\" by \"Yes\" so that you only see the keywords that you want to target.\n\nFor every keyword, add the name of the \"money page\" that keyword will be associated with to the \"Target Page\" column. Make sure that it matches the sheet names we made earlier!\n\nOn your \"Money page\" sheets, you'll see that the keywords from the research sheet that have this sheet as the target page have been copied over here.\n\nThe \"money page\" sheets allow you to see keywords on a page-by-page basis.\n\nAlong with the keywords, we can also see the monthly search volume, click value, Keyword Difficulty (KD), and Ranking Pages.\n\nMonthly Search Volume - How many people search for this keyword per month (on average). Note that this is an estimate, usually it's higher than what Ahrefs shows.\n\nClick Value - This is how much it would cost to buy every click for this term on Google Ads. This is a good way to measure how much money is in a keyword (that's a whole post on its own).\n\nKD - Don't take this at face value. Read Ahrefs article on how KD is calculated.\u00a0https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/keyword-difficulty\/\n\nRanking Pages - This column checks to see what competitor webpages are ranking for that keyword. By default, the formula is only in cell E2, you'll need to drag the anchor down to the rest of the cells.\n\nIf you're working with a lot of competitor websites, then the \"Ranking Pages\" column can become quite overwhelming. I suggest hiding this column until you need it.\n\nYou may encounter a \"money page\" sheet that looks like this\n\nThis is because the sheet uses a script based on the name of the sheet.\n\nWhen duplicating the Homepage sheet, the sheet name is \"Copy of Homepage.\" It can take a bit for the 'system' to recognize the new sheet name.\n\nIf you run into this issue, copy cell A1 and paste it back into A1. This seems to get the 'system' to recognize the change.\n\nKeyword Value\n\nNavigate to the \"Stats\" sheet.\u00a0\n\nThere's a couple of automated cells and a couple where you'll need to make edits.\n\nTotal Imported Terms - How many keywords were imported from Ahrefs.\n\nTotal Selected Terms - How many keywords you chose to target.\n\nTotal Search Volume - The total monthly search volume for your selected terms.\n\nEst. CTR - What percent of searchers will click through to your website. If you ranked #1 for all of your selected keywords then you can assume roughly 20-30% CTR. The more keywords you have the lower your avg. CTR will be. Unless you know what you're doing, I recommend leaving it at 5%.\n\nEst. Website Conv. Rate - The percent of visitors to your website that become a lead. If you're currently tracking this, then you'll be able to add your numbers here. Since we normally focus on MOFU (buyer intent) keywords for this sheet, the default is 20%. Or \"1 in 5 consumers who come to your website after searching for your services will become a lead.\"\n\nLead Value - This is how much a lead is worth to you. To figure out this number, use this tool.\n\nEst. Monthly Traffic - Total search volume multiplied by the CTR.\n\nEst. Monthly Leads - Monthly traffic multiplied by conversion rate.\n\nEst. Monthly Value - Monthly leads multiplied by lead value.\n\nSERP Features\n\nThe last sheet will tell you which SERP (Google results) features Ahrefs found for that keyword. This includes things like featured snippets, and YouTube videos.\n\nThe other columns will show an \"X\" if that particular feature appeared.\n\nThis is a great way to expand your visibility through what Rand Fishkin calls \"On SERP\" SEO.\n\nWant to know what keywords you should try and rank your YouTube videos on Google for? Here you go!\n\nWhich of your keywords have featured snippets? No reason to manually check hundreds or thousands of terms. ?\n\nTake Action!\n\nThis process allows you to spy on what's already working for your competitors, while automating the keyword mapping process and evaluating the estimated value of your keywords.\n\nDownload the spreadsheet (link above) and get to work!\n\nCompared to doing this manually, you'll save hours of work. If you have any questions, email me at Jarod (at) teambluedog (dot) com.\n\n  \u2022 After following the import process, I have noticed that the research tab doesn\u2019t display correct, keyword changes to position. If I change Tab A to \u2018#\u2019 keywords then shows but other values like search volume do not.\n\n    \u2022 Hi Dave,\n\n      I just tested it and it\u2019s still working for me. If you\u2019re still having issues feel free to email me jarod @ teambluedog (dot) com\n\n  \u2022 >",

        "text":"How to remove Untabs Virus Extension (Uninstall Guide) (May 2018 Update)\n\nThis page\u00a0aims to help you\u00a0remove the Untabs Virus. Our\u00a0removal instructions work for\u00a0Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer, as well as every version of Windows.\n\nIt is undoubtedly a rather unpleasant experience to have your Chrome, Firefox, IE or whatever other type of browser you might be using infiltrated by some strange and fishy piece of software that seems to be executing certain tasks that it was not permitted to. Normally, programs that do this are referred to as Browser Hijacker and in the following lines we will be focusing on one such particular program that is known under the name of Untabs Virus. Users who have had this piece of software installed onto their PC would usually report that it has changed their browser\u2019s frontpage as well as that it has installed some new obscure search engine on the browser replacing the default one with it. In some cases, it also seems that Untabs Virus tend to trigger page redirects or generate pesky pop-ups that worsen and obstruct one\u2019s browsing experience. If you, too, are going through such an unpleasant issue at this moment, we might be able to help you resolve it. Once you finish reading the current article, go to our guide that is located down below and use it to remove the intrusive piece of software from your machine. The instructions are easy to follow and should enable you to quickly and effectively uninstall and remove the nagging browser Hijacker.\n\nWhat are Hijackers primarily used for?\n\nIt should be obvious by now that most programs similar to Untabs Virus would hardly ever provide the user with any actual form of helpful or beneficial function. There are, of course, exceptions where a seemingly annoying program might actually prove to contain some actual use but this is hardly ever the case. The truth is that the majority of Browser Hijackers are developed with the single purpose of generating income for their creators by implementing and exploiting a variety of different techniques that mostly have something to do with the online marketing industry. However, the problem with Hijackers isn\u2019t only the fact that they can be extremely annoying and irritating but also that in certain situations, they can potentially compromise your system\u2019s security especially if you aren\u2019t careful around them. You can learn more about that in the next paragraph.\n\nWhat are the dangers?\n\nFirst and foremost, we ought to let you know that normally, programs like Untabs Virus aren\u2019t real PC viruses. Although a lot of experts and researchers might refer to them as malware, Hijackers are nowhere near as problematic or as harmful as viruses the likes of Trojan Horses, Ransomware, Spyware, etc. A typical Hijacker wouldn\u2019t try to harm your system or mess with the files that are on its hard-drive. However, certain security weaknesses and exploits might get triggered due to the Hijacker\u2019s presence on your system. One important thing to be careful with is the potential page redirects and pop-ups that some of those programs might generate. Interacting with them is very inadvisable since you never know what site may open and what its contents may be. Generally, if you think that you have a Hijacker on your computer, you should do your best to avoid clicking on anything that might come from it and also see to the unwanted software\u2019s removal ASAP.\n\nHijacker distribution and security tips\n\nUntabs Virus is actually quite innocent if compared to actual viruses such as the infamous Trojan Horses or the insidious Ransomware. However, if you do not learn how to protect your computer from potentially unwanted and hazardous software, you might end up landing all sorts of nasty programs that could cause way more problems than a Hijacker. For that, you should have a good idea about what are the most frequently employed methods for spreading such types if undesirable software. You probably already know that spam e-mails are an extremely popular tool for distributing shady applications so make sure to avoid opening any sketchy online letters that you might receive. Another thing to keep in mind is that not all Internet ads that you see are safe. In fact, a large portion of the pop-ups, banners and box messages that might appear in your browser might actually serve as redirect links to all sorts of unreliable sites that might be hazardous to your computer\u2019s security. Since most such obscure advertising materials can normally be found throughout the pages of fishy and potentially illegal sites, we strongly advise you to keep away from any web-addresses that you do not seem to be trusted. Lastly, never install anything on your PC before checking the setup wizard for application bundles. Oftentimes Hijackers and other forms of unwanted software get added to the installers of other programs and get installed along them if not unchecked from the setup menu. Do not make that mistake!

        "text":"Delete Temporary Windows Files to Speed Up Your Computer\n\ndelete temporary filesOver time, your Windows PC will build up temporary files. What are these temporary files for, you ask. Well, every time you run a program, temporary files are created periodically for backup purposes. This way, if the program happens to crash, the temporary files can potentially help you pick back up where you left off.\n\nThese temporary files are not automatically deleted after the program is shut down, so if you do not clean out these temp files regularly, you may have thousands of unnecessary files stored on your computer.\n\nAs you probably already know, these additional, unneeded files are taking up valuable space on your hard drive, which can ultimately contribute to much slower PC performance. There are many tools you can pay for that help remove temporary files from your PC, but this is easily a task you can perform yourself in Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7.\n\nYour first step should be to used the Disk Cleanup tool pre-installed with your Windows computer.\n\n  1. Click Start > Programs > Accessories > System Tools and then select Disk Cleanup.\n  2. After running an initial scan, Windows will alert you to the approximate amount of space that temporary files are taking up on your hard drive.\n  3. Check ALL of the boxes in the pop-up window, then click OK.\n\nThis solution will help remove the majority of the temporary files stored on your computer. Since many programs may store temporary files in locations other than those the Disk Cleanup tool check, you will also want to perform a search for additional temporary files that you can manually delete.\n\n  1. Open My Computer (or Computer in newer Windows versions).\n  2. In the search box, type the following characters: *.tmp (be sure to include the asterisk). This will search the entire hard drive so be patient if it take a few minutes.\n  3. After the results are shown, click the first result and scroll all the way to the bottom. Now hold down the SHIFT button and click the last result. This should select every temporary file that has been shown in the search.\n  4. With all of these files still selected, press and hold down SHIFT, then click DELETE.\n\nThis should permanently remove all of the temporary files. You should now be good to go, free of temporary files, and hopefully experiencing a faster computer.\n\nBe sure to perform this task on a regular basis to best ensure that temporary files are not slowing down your PC. We recommend doing this at least once a week or every other week.\n\nFeel free to share any other tips for removing temporary files in the comments below.\n\n..Sign up for Free Computer Maintenance\n\nPosted in Windows Tips Tagged with: , , , ,",

Sometimes you may have queries or issues with salesforce itself or the applications you have installed in your salesforce org. In order to assist you with the issue, you can grant account login access to the support or other Provider support whose applications you have installed in your org for a definite time.\n\n    In this way support can login into your org, using your login and can fix the issues you are facing. This is a hassle free way, which avoids sharing your Salesforce Credentials.\n\n    How To Grant Account Login Access in Salesforce\n\n    To Grant Account login access in Salesforce you can follow these simple steps :\n\n    Step:1 Go to-> Grant Account login access option in your personal setup. you likely to find \u2018Personal Setup\u2019 , at one of these places-\n\n    \u2022 In Lighting Experience, it is under settings->My personal Information->Grant Account login access.\n    \u2022 In the the older salesforce classic setup it is Setup-> Personal Information-> Grant Account login access.\n    \u2022 In the the newer salesforce classic setup it is My Settings > Personal > Grant Account login access.\n\n    Step:2 Select the Access duration.that is, How long you want support to have access of your account and save.\n\n    After saving this the Support will able to login in your account.\n\n    Additional Important Information\n\n      \u2022 You cannot grant login access if you\u2019re logged in as another individual through their login access.

Similarly, if the Admin has the feature \u201cOrganization Admins can Login as Any User\u201d privilege, Salesforce Support cannot login as a System Admin and then login as any User in their Organization. If Support needs access to both the end user and the Admin\u2019s account, both the Admin and end User will need to grant access separately.\n\n\n      \u2022 You have the option to either go back in multiple times and grant login access or you can grant a month as an option. It is whatever you are most comfortable with providing. Also once your case has been closed you are encouraged to go back in and set the access back to \u201cNo Access\u201d.\n\n\n    \u2022 You can\u2019t grant access to certain support organizations if your administrator has set up restrictions or a packaged application\u2019s license prevents it.\n\n\n    For further any query feel free contact us at\n\n    .\u00a0.\u00a0.\n\n\n    Add Your Comment\n\n    Be the first to comment.\n\n    Back to Top\n    Hire Us!\n    Brief us about your requirements and we'll get back to you.\n    Woo!

        "text":"Shedding light on dark social traffic\n\nA lot of great articles have been written about dark social traffic since 2013, but it\u2019s still an issue that impacts traffic data collection on a daily basis for all web analytics tools (even Google analytics). If you see a high\u00a0percentage of\u00a0direct traffic (especially for pages with long URLs, which are difficult to type), you should spend some time to go through this article.\n\nA very quick description of the term \u201cdark social\u201d and the issues it comes with is the following:\n\nDark social\u00a0 is used to group all traffic coming to a website, from Social networks, native mobile applications, chat clients or email but fails to be classified correctly by a Web analytics applications. This type of traffic usually appears as direct traffic. This happens\u00a0either to protect user\u2019s privacy or because some of these applications are not exposing information in the same way web browsers do. So at the end it\u2019s just\u00a0private referral traffic that\u2019s harder to track, as it comes back without referral data attached.\n\nFor more information about dark social you can check the links below:\n\nHow much impact does\u00a0\u201cdark social\u201d have on my\u00a0website?\n\nAccording to folks from, RadiumOne\u00a0more than 80% of online shares is happening through dark social!\n\nAnother way to understand the impact on your website, is to check your analytics platform for direct traffic on very long URLs. It\u2019s almost impossible that someone would visit a URL like just by typing it on his browser and the amount of visitors who bookmarked your URL or pasted it in their browser will probably not be that high. This is probably a URL that was accessed through a dark social traffic source.\n\nThere\u2019s a great article from Chris Breaux in Chartbeat\u2019s blog, explaining the most common sources of dark social traffic. He also tested the sources and found the cases where referrer information is not passed along to the target page of a link:\n\nReferrer Passed?\nMobile Browser\nMobile App\n\n* Sometimes when opening a link in a new tab referrer is not passed along\n\nHow to fix this issue?\n\nMake it very easy for your visitors to include referral data before sharing content from your website\n\n  1. Implement social sharing buttons that will also include a tracking code URL parameter in the URL being shared. Make sure that these buttons are easy to use and make the sharing process faster, otherwise it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense for the visitor to use them.\n  2. Include referral data on all the URLs of your website. This way if anyone decides to copy-paste and share one for your pages, he will probably also include valuable information about the visit. An advanced option available is\u00a0a GA plugin called\u00a0DirectMonster.js\u00a0by LunaMetrics. (If you\u2019d like to see that in action, Mashable seems to be using a similar approach:\u00a0Sample mashable article link )\n  3. Use campaign tracking codes when sharing links. If you are using GA you can use this builder to create campaign links compatible with GA\n  4. Decode the browser\u2019s user agent to understand the correct source of traffic (More details below).\n\nTrack visits by user agent\n\nThe user agent string, is a short text property that is available for every browser. This property holds details about the browser, the operating system and the device used to browse the web. There are bits and pieces available in most user agent strings, allowing\u00a0us to get more details about the correct traffic source, even for cases like the ones mentioned above. So when you set the rules that classify your traffic in marketing channels, be sure to include the following ones, to make you tracking even more accurate and minimize the impact of dark social traffic.\n\nFacebook mobile apps\n\nTo identify traffic from a facebook mobile app you can look for one of the following values in the user agent strings:\n\n  \u2022 FBAN\/\n  \u2022 FBAV\/\n  \u2022 FBBV\/\n  \u2022 FBDV\/\n  \u2022 FBMD\/\n  \u2022 FBSN\/\n  \u2022 FBSV\/\n  \u2022 FBSS\/\n  \u2022 FBLC\/\n  \u2022 FB4A;\n\nA few sample facebook user agent string including these values:\n\nMozilla\/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 10_3_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit\/603.1.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile\/14E304 [FBAN\/FBIOS;FBAV\/;FBBV\/57050710;FBDV\/iPhone8,1;FBMD\/iPhone;FBSN\/iOS;FBSV\/10.3.1;FBSS\/2;FBCR\/COSMOTE;FBID\/phone;FBLC\/el_GR;FBOP\/5;FBRV\/0]\n\nMozilla\/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 10_3_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit\/603.1.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile\/14E304 [FBAN\/FBIOS;FBAV\/;FBBV\/57733420;FBDV\/iPhone8,1;FBMD\/iPhone;FBSN\/iOS;FBSV\/10.3.1;FBSS\/2;FBCR\/vfGR;FBID\/phone;FBLC\/el_GR;FBOP\/5;FBRV\/0]\n\nMozilla\/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4.4; One Build\/KTU84L.H4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version\/4.0 Chrome\/ Mobile Safari\/537.36 [FB_IAB\/FB4A;FBAV\/;]\n\nTwitter mobile apps\n\nTo correctly identify traffic coming from a twitter mobile app, you can look for the following value in the user agent string:\n\n  \u2022 twitter\n\nA few sample user agent strings, that were captured using this rule:\n\nMozilla\/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 9_3_5 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit\/601.1.46 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile\/13G36 Twitter for iPhone\n\nMozilla\/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; E5823 Build\/32.3.A.2.33; wv) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version\/4.0 Chrome\/58.0.3029.83 Mobile Safari\/537.36 TwitterAndroid \n\nOther apps\n\nThis list can go on forever but it gets very time consuming to find differences in user agent string for less known apps. For me the best approach is to start capturing the user agent string in your web analytics platform, using the following JS property:\n\n\nOnce you started capturing user agents, you can start looking into all the values\u00a0classified as \u201cDirect\u201d traffic. Your will try to find patterns you could potentially classify as a different channel.\n\nWritten By\n\nPanagiotis (pronounced Panayotis) is a passionate G(r)eek with experience in digital analytics projects and website implementation.

Read more.\n\n\nNot always we want to lookup values based on one search parameter. For eg. Imagine you have data like below and you want to find how much sales Joseph made in January 2007 in North region for product \u201cFast car\u201d?\n\n\nData for this Example -Looing up Based on More than One Value\n\n\nSimple, use your index finger to scan the list and find the match \ud83d\ude09\n\nOf course, that wouldn\u2019t be scalable. Plus, you may want to put your index finger to better use, like typing . So, lets come up with some formulas that do this for us.\n\nYou can extract items from a table that match multiple criteria in multiple ways. See the examples to understand the techniques:\n\nUsing SUMIFS Formula [help]\nFormula =SUMIFS(lstSales, lstSalesman,valSalesman, lstMonths,valMonth, lstRegion,valRegion, lstProduct,valProduct)\nResult 1592\nUsing SUMPRODUCT Formula [help]\nFormula =SUMPRODUCT(lstSales,(lstSalesman=valSalesman)*(lstMonths=valMonth)*(lstRegion=valRegion)* (lstProduct=valProduct))\nResult 1592\nUsing INDEX & Match Formulas (Array Formula) [help]\nFormula {=INDEX(lstSales,MATCH(valSalesman&valMonth&valRegion&valProduct, lstSalesman&lstMonths&lstRegion&lstProduct,0))}\nResult 1592\nUsing VLOOKUP Formula [help]\nFormula =VLOOKUP(valMonth&valSalesman&valRegion&valProduct,tblData2,7,FALSE)\nResult 1592\nConditions: A helper column that concatenates month, salesman, region & product in the left most column of tblData2\nUsing SUM (Array Formula) [help]\nFormula {=SUM(lstSales*(lstSalesman=valSalesman)*(lstMonths=valMonth)* (lstRegion=valRegion)*(lstProduct=valProduct))}\nResult 1592\n\nSample File\n\nDownload Example File \u2013 Looking up Based on More than One Value\n\nGo ahead and download the file.

Gregory says:\n\n    Having more than one match for the search parameter would render the VLOOKUP Formula and the INDEX & MATCH Formulas with a single total and therefore the wrong answer. The SUMIFS, SUMPRODUCT, and SUM array formulas would give the correct answer should there be more than one match.\n\n    Fantastic worksheet, by the way. Loved all the formulas.\n\n  3. jeff weir says:\n\n    It's about time you stopped ignoring the DSUM function, Chandoo.\n\n    =DSUM(Database,\"Net Sales\",criteria)\n    * 'Database' is the named range $B$4:$H$1083 (i.e. all your records, including the column headers)\n    * \"Net Sales\" is simply the name of the column you are interested in adding up (and you could also use '6', which would tell the column to choose the 6th column from the edge of your database range)\n\n    * 'criteria' is a range of 8 cells that list each column you will be filtering on in the first row, and the things you are looking for in each column in the second row, i.e.:\n\n    Salesman Month Region Product\n    Joseph Jan-07 North FastCar\n\n    I've uploaded an amended spreadsheet to http:\/\/cid-f380a394764ef31f.office.live.com\/view.aspx\/.Public\/vlookup-on-multiple-conditions%20-%20DSUM.xls if anyone wants to play around with DSUM.\n\n    Also check out http:\/\/www.techonthenet.com\/excel\/formulas\/dsum.php for more examples of DSUM\n\n    \u2022 Janet says:\n\n      Hi everyone,\n\n      I have tried all of these options and none of them are working for me. I keep getting a #VALUE error. What am I doing wrong?\n\n      FYI I have a workbook with 4 sheets. I am using two sheets for this formula. This sheet that my data is in is called Fullyear (it has employee names in 1st col, then each employee has 6 different timeoff criteria, holiday, vacation, sick, personal, birthday, other listed in col 2, then the answer I seek is in the last column of the spreadheet named Endbal). The criteria to lookup is in sheet 4 called Lookup and they are in drop down format (so they should match), There are two criteria, employee name and timeoff so I choose \"Joe Smith\" and \"vacation\" and I want it to give me Joe Smith remaining vacation time from the last column.\n\n      Thank you\n\n  4. praveen says:\n\n    can you also help me with finding the minimum of values based on multiple conditions.\n\n  5. Hui... says:\n\n    Can you be a bit more specific like what conditions and what type of data and even ranges if you have them?\n\n  6. praveen says:\n\n    Hi Hui,\n    My requirement is to find a least cost option among various combinations for port transport.\n    My data table would have the name of source port, name of destination from port, type of vessel to be handled, cost of transportation (port+ inland and others).\n    I need to find the least cost for a specific destination for a specific vessel among various ports.\n\n    You can explain it using the data provided above in your example, instead of a specific output i need a min among the selection. Lets say lowest sales by joseph for fast car in your example.\n\n    I was able to get the solutions after burning some brain cells by applying pivot table. Is there any specific way to do this with cell formula.\n\n\n  7. Chandoo says:\n\n    @Praveen.. you can use MIN() formula to do this:\n\n    For eg. Assuming A1:A100 has sales person name, B1:B100 has product and C1:C100 as sales and you want to find out what is the min. sales for John for the product ABC,\n\n\n    You must enter this as an array formula - ie press CTRL+SHIFT+Enter when you finish typing to get the result.\n\n    \u2022 Farhad says:\n\n      In the above scenario, for getting the Max sales, it was possible to do so without the use of an array function (as below). Wondering if it is also possible to get the min sales without the use of an array ...\n\n    \u2022 ZEYNEP YILMAZ says:\n\n      Hi Chandoo,\n\n      Firstly I want to thank you and also this forum. I learned a lot. I'm very appreciate.\n\n      I tried the below ones for create conditional min and max formulas. But I couldn't success to make them run.\n      (My data is like exactly you define : A1:A14 has sales person name, B1:B14 has product and C1:C14)\n      (with press CTRL+SHIFT+Enter)\n      What is missing in these, i wonder?\n      May I ask your help please?\n\n      Thanks a lot in advance....\n\n  8. Sidhesh Mangle says:\n\n    Hey praveen,\n    Check the Dsum formula given by jeff weir above...\n\n    Similarly, you can use Dmin formula to get Minimum value as per mutiple criterias\n\n    Database Functions -> Dsum,Dmax, Dmin, Davg etc r very easy n Powerfull without any Complex nested formulas.\n\n    fyi - Hit F1 in Excel & search Database Functions - You'll get entire list with syntax n example\n\n  9. jeff weir says:\n\n    @chandoo...that's funny, I thought I commented on this, but my comment didn't show. Can you check your spam filter?\n\n  10. praveen says:\n\n    hi chandoo,\n    works wonderfully. I was not able to ignore the irrelevant values in my minimum function. \"\" this has done the trick.\n    What exactly does \"\" do in a array function.\n\n\n  11. Chandoo says:\n\n    @Jeff.. if you are referring to the DSUM comment, it is above. Else, I got nothing. Can you repost?\n\n    @Praveen... \"\" is nothing but an empty string. This forces to MIN to take the minimum value from the list. Just examine the formula to understand how it works.\n\n  12. jeff weir says:\n\n    After the DSUM comment I thought I answered Praveen's question with 4 different examples. But never mind, I see you've helped Praveen out...good man!\n\n  13. Jim Watson says:\n\n    I have noticed that you always enter \"false\" at the end of VLOOKUP formulas to get an exact match. Did you know you can save yourself some typing by entering zero \"0\" instead of \"false\" (w\/o the quotes) and \"1\" for true? The fewer keystrokes needed the better, I always say.\n\n  14. Ram Kapoor says:\n\n    Hi Chandoo,\n\n    Answer for the second question (for homework) can be = =SUM((lstSalesman=K35)*(lstRegion=M35)*((MONTH(lstMonths)={1,2,3}*(YEAR(lstMonths)=2008))*(lstSales))).\n\n  15. tan tan says:\n\n    Please explain the \"val\" in the formulas above. Or can you give the formulas with column and rows cell. eg. (Jan-0... (truncated)",

Learn more and find or contribute RSS resources for best election results coverage.\n\nYesterday, Jessica Dolcourt provided four great applications for tracking U.S. election results online. I wanted to quickly follow up with a short word about my favorite RSS ticker tool, the simply named Mozilla Firefox add-on RSS Ticker, currently at version 2.0.3.\n\nIf you want to work, chat, watch videos, listen to music, or do any other fun Internet stuff instead of tracking election results constantly on news sites, RSS Ticker provides a nifty way of keeping up with breaking election news via a nonintrusive ticker that runs across the bottom of Firefox's interface, below your status bar.\n\nRSS Ticker\nAfter two years of presidential electioneering, a dog saving kittens is the kind of news I need.\n\nRSS Ticker installs like any other Firefox extension, with a pop-up window after you allow to install add-ons to Firefox. If you have trouble, save the .xpi file locally, and then open it from Firefox.\n\nRSS Ticker\nThe Feeds tab of the RSS Ticker options makes it simple to see which feeds are included in the scrolling ticker.\n\nAfter the RSS Ticker extension is installed and Firefox is restarted, RSS Ticker will automatically scrape all of your bookmarks for XML feeds and display them in ticker fashion. If you have a lot of RSS feeds in your bookmarks, the first thing you'll want to do is go to Tools -> Extension Options -> RSS Ticker, then click the Feeds button to decide which specific feeds you want included in the ticker.\n\nThe RSS Ticker options menu also lets you adjust the speed and frequency of the ticker, reposition it (it can also be placed under your bookmarks toolbar), disable the ticker, adjust the width of individual news items, and additional customizations.\n\nIf you're looking for RSS feeds to track the presidential election, Google is obviously a huge resource (as is the company's online RSS app, Google Reader), but here are a few selections that I have in my ticker:\n\n  \u2022 CBS News politics feed (disclaimer: CBS owns CNET)\n  \u2022 CBS News \"Horse Race\" feed\n  \u2022 CNET Politics and Law blog\n  \u2022 ABC News politics feed\n  \u2022 Fox News politics feed\n  \u2022 MSNBC Decision '08 feed\n  \u2022 What are some of your favorite RSS political sources?

You won't need to use 7zip's graphical user interface, so no need to run it after installing.\n  3. 3\n    In Notepad, insert this single line of code: for \/d\u00a0%%X in (*) do \"c:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\7z.exe\" a \"%%X.7z\" \"%%X\\\"\n  4. 4\n    Note: If you'd like to output to .ZIP files, change the \"%%X.7z\" to \"%%X.zip\"\n  5. 5\n  6. 6\n    Browse to the location of the folders you want to compress. In our example it is in C:\\My Music.\n  7. 7\n    Create your very own batch file by setting 'Save as type' to 'All files' and naming it something like 'foldertomultiple7z.bat'. Take note of the file extension, which is .bat. Be sure not to set the file type as 'Text Documents' too.\n  8. 8\n    Click Save.\n  9. 9\n    Close Notepad and navigate to your 'My Music' folder. Notice that the batch file is at the same directory level as the folders that need to be compressed.\n  10. 10\n    Run the batch file by double-clicking on your bat file within your 'My Music' folder. DO NOT run as Administrator (option appears in right-click menu) - running as Administrator will compress the files in windows\/system32. After you double-click on the bat file, the windows command prompt appears and 7zip begins to do its thing.\n\n  11. 11\n    Verify the validity of your compressed folders. To do this, highlight them all and click the right mouse button. If you installed 7zip in its default setting, you'll have its menu incorporated in the Windows shell. Navigate to it and click 'Test Archive.'\n\nCommunity Q&A\n\nUnanswered Questions\nShow more unanswered questions\nAsk a Question\n200 characters left\n    If this question (or a similar one) is answered twice in this section, please click here to let us know.\n\n\n    \u2022 Changing the code in Notepad so that the resulting file extension is .cbz (instead of .zip) will enable this to work well for people using this batch file to show up in comic book readers.\n    \u2022 Keep your batch file for future use. The next time you need to compress multiple folders just Copy\/Paste it to the main directory where the said folders reside and run it.\n    \u2022 DO NOT run as administrator. This will compress the files in windows\/system32. Just double-click from within target folder will do the job.\n    \u2022 If 7-zip is installed somewhere else in your system, find its location and replace it in the code.\n    \u2022 You can use the batch file to compress any folder, not just music folders.\n    \u2022 You can name the .bat file to friendly name like 7z-all.bat and put it inside Windows folder, so it will be accessible for the whole system. After that to use, In Windows 7 and 8.x, click with the right mouse button in the blank space of a folder holding the Shift key, an option Open Command Window Here will appear. Clicking that will open a command line window for the current folder.

        "text":"Quick n Dirty Animation.\n\n\nDespite being a bit of a technologist, I am, in some ways, a Luddite at heart. \u00a0I learned animation on paper, with a 16mm Bolex to shoot with. \u00a0Eventually I graduated up to the monster Oxberry animation stands before later starting to work with computer animation for remainder of my time in college and thence into professional life.\n\nIf you want further information about Quinda that\u2019s not covered here, here are some other places to look, and possibly ask a question or two\u2026\n\nThe Motivation\n\nComputer animation is a lovely thing, but automatic tweening can be a crutch. \u00a0I don\u2019t want much in an animation program. An area to draw, frames to compare, and cycles. what I really want is something simple with which to play. \u00a0I want a simple way to recreate the fun that I had when I took animation 1 in college. I think I have managed to get most of the different techniques from that semester crammed into one small package. I have added a few extra things to make it a bit more useful, and there\u2019s room to add more features should anyone ask (nicely.)\n\nThe Basics\n\nAnimationScreenThe basics are that you can simply draw frames right on the screen and advance to the next frame until you have an entire animation. by default, while you\u2019re drawing, an onion skin is shown that references the previous and following 5 frames in highlighting colors, red for history, blue for future. Draw with one finger, swipe left and right with two fingers to change frames. You can do quite a lot without ever leaving this screen. swipe up with two fingers to delete the last stroke. (note that this is not an \u2018undo\u2019, it just delete\u2019s the most recent stroke, so you can delete all the way back to an empty frame if you so choose.)\n\nEventually you\u2019ll want to play the animation back. To get to the controls, you can touch the little gear in the upper left corner. \u00a0(you can tap the screen with three fingers if you want to skip ahead to the playback mode\u2026)\n\nThe Tool ScreenScreenshot 2013.12.17 15.21.46\n\nThe control screen is broken up to several areas. of primary concern right now are the playback and timing controls at the bottom of the screen. They are basic controls, play, step forward, and step backwards. Also notice the little clock in the lower left. The step forward and step back buttons are pretty self explanatory except that the \u2018step forward\u2019 button will add new blank frames if you step beyond the end of the animation. The clock takes you to the playback screen where you get to make cycles, adjust the timing of individual frames, and playback the animation. The Play button actually does the same, but it also starts the playback right away.\n\n\nIn order to help you draw where you want to draw, the main drawing screen has a couple of helpful options. \u00a0A field guide, and Onion skinning. \u00a0on the tool screen, these controls are to the upper right. A button that looks like a grid, and a button that looks like an onion. Onion skinning is on by default, but there are times when you may prefer not to see it.\n\n\nover on the lower right of the tool screen are the frame edit tools. one will delete the current frame and the other will insert a blank frame at the current frame number, moving the subsequent frames one frame.\n\nArt tools\n\nThere are three buttons in the middle that give you control over your drawing tool. The button right in the middle takes you to the color picker. Just to the right of that is the brush picker, and to the left is the pencil button which is just a preset to give you a thin grey line.\n\nFile tools\n\nJust above the Art tools you control the file itself. \u00a0From left to right,\n\n  \u2022 create a new animation, (closes the current animation and creates a new empty one.\n  \u2022 open another animation, (presents a list of all the animation you have made)\n  \u2022 rename your animation, (presents a way to type in a new name for your animation.)\n  \u2022 share your animation, (once you have created a Gif on the playback screen, this is where you would go to share it.)\n\n\nScreenshot 2013.12.17 15.23.30There are basically 2 different ways you can adjust the timing of your animation. You can hold on a single frame for a while, or you can cycle a set of frames for a certain number of repetitions. As such, there is a control on either side of the screen. On the left is the cycle controls, on the right, the frame hold time.\n\nStarting with the hold control on the right, you may notice that the default frame rate is 8 frames a second, (equivalent to what\u2019s known as \u201cshooting in 3s\u201d at 24 frames a second.) So, each frame is on screen for 1\/8th of a second (or .125 seconds if you have a digital watch.) As you slide your finger up and down the control, you will see the \u2018frame duration\u2019 number go up and down. for very specific control, you tap the ends of the control, and the timer goes up or down by 1\/16th of a second. (.0625sec)\n\nOn the left is the cycle control.\n\n  \u2022 A cycle is a series of frames that you repeat, either to show a repetitive motion, (like walking) or just to keep things looking alive while nothing else is happening. One of the features of hand drawn animation is that it can be difficult to be very precise with your drawings and as a result, lines move. \u00a0If you just stop on a single frame, things can appear \u2018dead\u2019. \u00a0instead, \u00a0you might draw three or four nearly identical frames and repeat them. \u00a0The object won\u2019t move in the frame, but the lines will still be moving. It\u2019s a technique to make things feel more alive. Alternatively, it might take 8 frames to animate a character taking a full walking stride. You can cycle those 8 frames to make the character walk for as long as you like.\n\nThe number labeling the control is the number of times that the cycle is repeated. A 0 indicates that the frames are simply played through. A setting of 1 repeats the cycle once, therefore each frame in the cycle gets played twice. As an example, if you set frame 5 to do a 3 frame cycle 3 times, the frame sequence goes like this: 0,1,2,3,4,5,3,4,5,3,4,5,3,4,5, 6,7,8,9. Note that the cycle count is the number of repeats, not the number of plays. Basically, cycling is like shouting \u201cEncore!\u201d \u00a0 If you add a cycle, a second control for the length of the cycle will appear. The default length of a cycle is 3 frames. Cycles are not recursive.\n\nThe whole screen is also a jog control. drag one finger left and right across the screen to scroll through the frames in either direction.\n\nLastly is the Create Gif button. touching this control will create an animated gif of the animation, which is saved in the application\u2019s Documents folder. Your animation can then be shared from the Share button on the tool screen, or via iTunes sharing. (suggestions for more ways to share are welcome\u2026)\n\nTo return to drawing, poke the X in the upper left or poke the screen with a two finger tap\n\nThe Camera Controls\n\nAlso on the tool screen, over on the left, are tools for adding (and subtracting)\u00a0photos to frames. The camera shaped button opens the camera, and the picture with an \u2018X\u2019 on it removes the picture from the current animation frame. If you press the camera button, you\u2019re taken to the camera view.\n\nThe camera has three options. You can take a single photo for the frame you are on, take a photo and automatically advance to the next frame, (ready to take another one,) or set it on automatic time-lapse. If you choose time-lapse, you are presented a control to set the time-lapse interval, counted in seconds.\n\nWhen you have the right interval, press \u2018Start\u2019 and the camera will wait that many seconds and then fire and it will continue to do that until you hit stop.\n\nAs on the main drawing screen, there is a field guide to help with your alignment.\n\nWhen you are done, poke the \u2018x\u2019 button to return to the drawing screen. (note that if you were shooting and advancing, or using time-lapse and went beyond the length of your animation, the frame you return to may be blank. if you don\u2019t see a picture, it is probably because you are not on the frame you think you are\u2026)\n\n\nOne thought on \u201cQuinda\n\n  1.
