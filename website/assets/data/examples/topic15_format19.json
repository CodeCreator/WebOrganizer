        "text":"The process of rubbing, grinding, or wearing away by friction.\n\nAcid Steel\n\nSteel melted in a furnace with an acid bottom and lining and under a slag containing an excess of an acid substance such as silica.\n\n\nThe change a passive surface of a metal undergoes to become a chemically active state. Contrast with passivation.\n\n\nIn a metal or alloy, a change in properties that generally occurs slowly at room temperature and more rapidly at higher temperatures.\n\nAir \u2013 Hardening Steel\n\nA steel containing sufficient carbon in other alloying elements to harden fully during cooling in air or other gaseous mediums form a temperature above its transformation range. The term should be restricted to steels that are capable of being hardened by cooling in air in fairly large sections, about two inches or more in diameter. Same as self-hardening steel.\n\n\nComposite sheet produced by bonding either corrosion-resistant aluminum alloy or aluminum of high purity to base metal of structurally stronger aluminum alloy.\n\nAlloy Steel\n\nSteel containing significant quantities of alloying elements (other than carbon and the commonly accepted amounts of manganese, silicon, sulphur, and phosphorus) added to affect changes in the mechanical or physical properties.\n\n\nForming an aluminum or aluminum alloy coating on a metal by hot dipping, hot spraying, or diffusion.\n\n\nHeating to and holding at a suitable temperature and then cooling at a suitable rate, for such purposes as reducing hardness, improving machine ability, facilitating cold working, producing a desire, micro structure, or obtaining desired mechanical , physical, or other properties. When applicable, the following more specific terms should be used: black annealing, blue annealing, box annealing, bright annealing, flame annealing, graphitizing, intermediate annealing, isothermal annealing, malleablizing, process annealing, quench annealing, recrystallizing annealing and spheroidizing. When applied to ferrous alloys, the term \u201c annealing \u201c , without qualification, implies full annealing. when applied to non ferrous alloys, the term \u201cannealing\u201d implies a heat treatment designed to soften a cold worked structure by recrystallizing or subsequent grain growth or to soften an age-harden alloy by causing a nearly complete precipitation of the second phase in relatively course form. Any process or annealing will usually reduce stresses , but if the treatment is applied the sole purpose of such relief, it should be designated stress relieving.\n\nAtomic-Hydrogen Welding\n\nArc welding with heat from and arc between two tungsten or other suitable electrodes in a hydrogen atmosphere. The use of pressure and filler metal is optional.\n\n\nQuenching a ferrous alloy from a temperature above the transformation range, in a medium having a rate of heat abstraction high enough to prevent the formation of high-temperature transformation products, and then holding the alloy, until transformation is complete, as a temperature below that of pearlite formation and above that of all martensite formation.\n\n\nA solid solution of one or more elements in face-centered cubic iron.\n\n\nForming austenite by heating a ferrous alloy into the transformation range (partial austenitizing) or above the transformation range (complete austenitizing).\n\n\nA decomposition product of austenite consisting of an aggregate of ferrite and carbide. In general, it forms at temperatures lower than those where very fine pearlite forms and higher than that where martensite begins to form on cooling. Its appearance is feathery if formed in the upper part of the temperature range; acicular, resembling tempered martensite, if formed in the lower part.\n\nBanded Structure\n\nA segregated structure of nearly parallel bands aligned in the direction of working.\n\n\nThe decarburized layer just beneath the scale that results from heating steel in an oxidizing atmosphere.\n\nBasic Steel\n\nSteel melted in a furnace with a basic bottom and lining and under a slag containing an excess of a basic substance such as a magnesia or lime.\n\nBearing Load\n\nA compressive load supported by a member, usually a tube or a collar, along a line where contact is made with a pin, rivet, axle, or shaft.\n\nBearing Strength\n\nThe maximum bearing load at failure divided by the effective bearing area. In a pinned or riveted joint, the effective area is calculated as the product of the diameter of the hole and the thickness of the bearing member.\n\nBend Test\n\nA test for determining relative ductility of metal that is to be formed, usually sheet, strip, plate, or wire, and for determining soundness and toughness of metal. The specimen is usually bent over a specified diameter through a specified angle for a specified number of cycles.\n\nBent Radius\n\nThe inside radius of a bent section.\n\nBessemer Process\n\nA process for making steel by blowing air through molten pig iron contained in a refractory lined vessel so as to remove by oxidation most of the carbon, silicon, and manganese.\n\n\nA solid semi-finished round or square product that has been hot worked by forging, rolling or extrusion. An iron or steel billet has a minimum width or thickness of 1 1\/2 in. and the cross-sectional area varies from 2 1\/4 to 36 sq. in. For non-ferrous metals, it may also be a casting suitable for finished or semi-finished rolling or for extrusion.\n\n\nA defect in metal, on or near the surface, resulting from the expansion of gas in a subsurface zone. Very small blisters are called \u201cpinheads\u201d or \u201cpepper blisters\u201d.\n\n\nA semi-finished hot rolled product, rectangular in cross section, produced on a blooming mill for iron and steel, the width is not more than twice the thickness, and the cross-sectional area is usually not less than 36 sq. in. Iron and steel blooms are sometimes made by forging.\n\nBlue Annealing\n\nHeating hot rolled ferrous sheet in an open furnace to a temperature within the transformation range and then cooling in air in order to soften the metal. The transformation of a bluish oxide on the surface is incidental.\n\nBlue Brittleness\n\nBrittlenesss exhibited by some steels after being heated to some temperature within the range of 300\u00b0 to 650\u00b0F, and more especially if the steel is worked at the elevated temperature. Killed steels are virtually free of this kind of brittleness.\n\n\nSubjecting the scale-free surface of a ferrous alloy to the action of air, stream, or other agents at a suitable temperature, thus forming a thin blue film of oxide and improving the appearance and resistance to corrosion. NOTE: This term is ordinarily applied to sheet, strip, or finished parts. It is used also to denote the heating of springs after fabrication in order to improve their properties.\n\nBox Annealing\n\nAnnealing a metal or alloy in a sealed container under conditions that minimize oxidization. In box annealing a ferrous alloy, the charge is usually heated slowly to a temperature below the transformation range, but sometimes above or within it, and then cooled slowly; this process is also called \u201cclose annealing\u201d or \u201cpot annealing\u201d.\n\nBright Annealing\n\nAnnealing in a protective medium to prevent discoloration of the bright surface.\n\nBrinell Hardness Test\n\nA test for determining the hardness of a material by forcing a hard steel or carbide ball of specified diameter into it under a specified load.\n\nBrittle Fracture\n\nFracture with little or no plastic deformation.\n\n\n(1) Permanently damaging a metal or alloy by heating to cause either incipient melting or intergranular oxidation. See overheating. (2) In grinding getting the work hot enough to cause discoloration or to change the microstructure by tempering or hardening.\n\n\nSmoothing surfaces through frictional contact between the work and some hard pieces of material such as hardened metal balls.\n\n\n(1) Deviation from edge straightness usually referring to the greatest deviation of side edge from a straight line. (2) Sometimes used to denote crown in rolls where the center diameter has been increased to compensate for deflection caused by the rolling pressure.\n\n\nA dished distortion in a flat or nearly flat surface sometimes referred to as \u201coil canning\u201d.\n\nCapped Steel\n\nSemikilled steel cast in a bottle-top mold and covered with a cap fitting into the neck of the mold. The cap causes the top metal to solidify. Pressure is built up in the sealed-in molten metal and results in a surface condition much like that of rimmed steel.\n\nCarbon Steel\n\nSteel containing carbon up to about 2% and only residual quantities of other elements except those added for deoxidization, with silicon usually limited to 0.60% and manganese to about 1.65%. Also termed \u201cplain carbon steel\u201d, \u201cordinary steel\u201d, and \u201cstraight carbon steel\u201d.\n\n\nIntroducing carbon and nitrogen into a solid ferrous alloy by holding above Ac1 in an atmosphere that contains suitable gases such as hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and ammonia. The carbonitrided alloy is usually quench hardened.\n\n\nIntroducing carbon into a solid ferrous alloy by holding above Ac1 in contact with a suitable carbonaceous material, which may be a solid, liquid, or gas. The carburized alloy is usually quench hardened.\n\nCase Hardening\n\nHardening a ferrous alloy so that the outer portion, or case, is made substantially harder than the inner portion, or core. Typical processes used for case hardening are carburizing, cyaniding, carbonitriding, nitriding, induction hardening, and flame hardening.\n\n\nA compound of iron and carbon, known chemically as iron carbide and having the approximate chemical formula Fe3C. It is characterized by an orthorhombic crystal structure. When it occurs as a phase in steel, the chemical composition will be altered by the presence of manganese and other carbide-forming elements.\n\nCentrifugal Casting\n\nA casting made by pouring metal into a mold that is rotated or revolved.\n\nCeramic Tools\n\nCutting tools made from fused, sintered, or cemented metallic oxides.\n\n\n(1) A beveled surface to eliminate an otherwise sharp corner. (2) A relieved angula... (truncated)",

The low susceptibility cows had a higher liquid milk production and a lower milkfat percentage than the high susceptible ones. They showed little or no bloat on highly potent pastures. Comparison of the herds was directed towards physiological differences and relationships which could explain the origin of low susceptibility and lead to phenotypic definition useful for selection. Some differences were found in proportions of salivary proteins and progress has been made in their separation, definition and measurement. In vitro experiments have not indicated sufficient differences in gas or foam production per litre of rumen fluid to explain bloat grade variation but observation followed by direct experiment has shown that a greater volume of rumen fluid is associate4d with a high susceptibility to bloat. This could form a basis for commercial selection if appropriate measurement methods can be devised.

Each IRF country has its own methods for accomplishing this, and these methods are variable from country to country. However, in order to be able to compare offshore safety performance among IRF participants a common framework is needed. The IRF Performance Measures Project was undertaken to establish such a framework. A framework based on a common set of definitions and criteria has been developed.

The AFP was beginning its initial start up. As the level in one of the towers increased, steam was added to the reboiler to begin producing overhead product. During this time, the safety valves on the tower began relieving to the flare system, which resulted in the reported flare. During the conversion of the unit the overhead pressure meter was reranged in the field, but was no reranged in the control room. Due to this oversight the operator believed he was at a significantly lower pressure and did not immediately discover that the safety valves on the tower had lifted to the flare system. The calculations automtically completed by the flare system\n\nFollowup: No\n\nNotes: The cause of the accident is listed as preventable in the company's report, but there is no explanation whatsoever as to why it was preventable - that section is blank. The only remedial measure listed is that the pressure meter range was corrected in the control room. The letter to LDEQ states that reportable quantities of nitrogen oxide and butenes were exceeded.\n4.0 pounds\n\nLeak\/feed line leak\nCause: Corrosion\/corrosion leak occurred through a 3\/8 hole on the #2 feed inlet pip\n\nFollowup: No\n\nNotes: The tower that the corroded pipe led to was shut down and filled with water to stop residual hydrocarbon vapors from leaking out of the hole. The hole was plugged.An engineered leak box was installed on the line.",
