Now, there are new photos of Disney\u2019s\u00a0Star Wars hotel that\u2019ll have fans of the sci-fi series excited to head to the Florida park.\n\nThe new hotel isn\u2019t quite like others. Instead, it takes more of a cruise ship sort of vibe. Guests who visit Disney World will have the option to stay in the\u00a0Star Wars:\u00a0Galactic Starcruiser for a two-day and two-night immersive experience. Guests will all enter the hotel at the same time and then depart on the\u00a0Halcyon a fictional intergalactic cruiser where over the course of their stay they\u2019ll visit exotic locations and bunk up as if in their own rebel quarters.\n\nThanks to new photos what these bunks will look like\u2014with their orange and white design reminiscent of rebel X-wing fighters uniforms and with the same aesthetic as the Millenium Falcon\u2014it\u2019s hard not to see how the hotel would be a dream for\u00a0Star Wars fans.\n\nDisney's Star Wars hotel features orange and white decor and a futuristic design.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that the hotel and experience look cool, though. While staying at the hotel, you\u2019ll also get to wield a lightsaber (aka my dream), live your best Lando Calrissian-inspired life in the Silver C Lounge, and get a peek at just what it would take to run a spaceship.\n\n\nCurrently, the hotel is slated to open in 2021, but no specific date has been given. But if you want to learn more and see more of the hotel, you can find all the details on the Disney Parks page.\n\nShea Simmons Shea Simmons\nShea Simmons is an Atlanta-based writer who has written about everything from whether Crisco is a good moisturizer to how to KonMari your space.

        "text":"No new park is coming, but there are still some exciting developments in store for Tokyo Disney!\n\nLast year word got out that Oriental Land, the company that owns the rights to Tokyo Disney Resort, was planning a 300 billion-yen (US$2.6-million) expansion of the Tokyo Disney park area. Many Disney fans held on to the hope that they were using that money to build a whole new third park, in addition to the already thriving Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea.\n\nSadly, that turned out to be only a rumor, because it\u2019s recently been announced that instead that money will be used on additions to the resort area as well as to both of the existing parks.\n\n\u25bc Tokyo Disney recently celebrated its 35th Anniversary.\n\nOn November 28, the company unveiled plans to build a new hotel in Tokyo Disney Resort, which will be themed off of the Disney\/Pixar film\u00a0Toy Story, possibly one of the most beloved Disney franchises of all time. The entire hotel will be designed from the inside out to look like it\u2019s made up of toys, as if each guest has stepped into the world of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. Even the garden and the exterior of the building will apparently be decked out Toy Story style!\n\nEach of the rooms will be decorated like Andy\u2019s room, and will be filled with colorful furniture and decorations. In spite of the fact that they are part of a resort hotel, Oriental Land has said that the rooms will be very affordable because they will be of a standardized size.\n\nThe building is expected to be 11 stories tall, with an extra basement level, and will have as many as 600 rooms, which is plenty of space to accommodate the growing number of visitors to Tokyo Disney. There will, of course, also be specialized restaurants, which makes it all the more exciting for Disney fans. It\u2019s expected to be finished in 2021, so keep your eyes peeled for future announcements!\n\n\u25bc With a new\u00a0Toy Story moving coming out next summer, the announcement comes with pretty good timing!\n\nThat\u2019s not the only news Oriental Land announced, either; part of the 300 billion yen update also includes new areas for both Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea parks! That means new rides, new restaurants, new shows, and new photo opportunities for all to enjoy. They haven\u2019t announced what the themes for the new areas will be yet, but they did say that the one in Tokyo Disneyland will be opening in 2020, perhaps in time for the Olympics, while Disney Sea\u2019s will open in 2022.\n\nWith such exciting developments on the way, it makes me want to book my\u00a0Christmas and New Year\u2019s plans at Tokyo Disney this year. I wonder what kind of holiday festivities the new sections will hold?\n\nTop\/Featured Image: YouTube\/Disney Pixar",

Garfinkel also has been inundated.\n\n\"This is going to be a great opportunity for Ian and, in the process, will expose millions of television viewers to Grass Valley,\" Davies said.\n\nThe Holbrooke Hotel has had its ups and downs in recent years, and struggling with the current economy has been a challenge in search of a solution, so advice from the New York City hotel guru will be welcomed, according to the chamber of commerce release.\n\nMelchiorri will reportedly look for ways to improve the Holbrooke's business, reposition the operation and fill the hostelry with satisfied, repeat guests.\n\nGarfinkel said he was looking forward to the kind of frank critique that has made Melchiorri's program one of the most popular shows on the Travel Channel,, and the chamber of commerce is excited by the free publicity, the Travel Channel reported.\n\n\"Getting advice from someone who has helped revitalize iconic New York City hotels like the Plaza and Algonquin will absolutely benefit the Holbrooke and, by extension, will also benefit our community,\" Davies said.\n\nMelchiorri finds online reviews to be very helpful as he prepares to visit a hotel, reported Travel Channel representatives, so Davies hopes that the program host has approached his current assignment with optimism.\n\n\"The Holbrooke has an outstanding reputation, and online reviews show strong customer support \u2014 both in the bar and restaurant and also in the hotel itself,\" Davies said. \"But there's always room for improvement, and fresh ideas can often energize a business.\"\n\nThe crew from the show will film at the hotel through March 5, said a spokeswoman. The episode planned to feature the Holbrooke Hotel has yet to be scheduled on \"Hotel Impossible\" next season.\n\nTo contact Staff Writer Christopher Rosacker, email or call (530) 477-4236.",

It is provided only for personal research purposes and may not be reprinted.\n\nAt long last, winter's belated arrival helped lift bookings out of the doldrums at mountain resorts in Utah and other Western states.\n\nThe Denver-based Rocky Mountain Lodging Report said Monday that lodging establishments it monitors in Park City and other Utah ski destinations filled almost 71 percent of their rooms in February. That was up from 67 percent a year earlier and 59 percent in February 2010.\n\nLong-awaited snowfall boosted those numbers, said another group out of Denver, the Mountain Travel Research Program, based on data from 265 property-management companies overseeing 24,000 rooms in 15 resort communities in Utah, Colorado, California and Oregon.\n\n\"Reservations taken in February for arrival in February were up 6.2 percent compared to the same month last year,\" said Research Program Director Ralf Garrison.\n\n\"Despite uncooperative weather patterns and the third warmest winter in the U.S.'s recorded history, skiers and riders still tracked the snow, and lodging rates and showed up when the snow flew,\" he added. \"Although overnight lodging occupancy was down slightly for the month, it was better than we feared, in some cases offset by surprising strength in rate.\"\n\nGarrison's research showed that occupancy last month in those four Western states ended up 2 percent below the level for February 2011. Hoteliers and property managers made up for some of that deficit, bumping up the average daily rate 2.7 percent.\n\nIn Utah, February's average daily rate climbed to $249, up about $4 from the previous year. The figure most important to the lodging industry, Revpar, or revenue available per room, climbed to $176 per day from $158 daily in February 2011, according to the monthly Rocky Mountain Lodging Report.\n\nAlthough conditions improved considerably in February, Garrison's report found that bookings for March remained almost 4 percent behind the same month a year earlier, with daily rates up only 1.1 percent.\n\nRising gas prices are a concern, Garrison said, but he found some comfort in the fact that for the first time since the Great Recession began in late 2007, weather was more important than the economy in influencing the resort industry's health.\n\n\"Decent weather returned mid-season to help generate some additional late-season demand, but not enough for a full recovery in most cases,\" he said. \"Despite the challenges, many mountain destinations seem to have done a good job managing 'the hand they were dealt' by controlling the elements they could \u2014 slope maintenance and attention to guest services.\"\n\nWhether they did that well enough to maintain customer loyalty, Garrison said, will be determined in coming months when people begin making reservations for next winter.\n\nElsewhere in Utah, the Rocky Mountain Lodging Report said occupancy statewide during February was 65 percent, up from 63 percent a year earlier, with the cost of a room climbing $5 nightly to $111.\n\nIn Salt Lake County, hoteliers filled 74 percent of their rooms nightly last month, a 4 percent jump from the previous February. On average, rooms went for $99 a night, up from $92 a year earlier.\n\n\nTwitter: @sltribmikeg",

MAARTEN \u2013 MSC Divina cruise ship from MSC Cruises made an unscheduled port call on Tuesday morning January 30.\u00a0\u00a0The cruise line was scheduled to return to the destination on\u00a0March 28, more than two months away.\n\nPort St. Maarten Management took the opportunity Tuesday morning to welcome the vessel to the \u2018Friendly Island.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0MSC Divina was scheduled to call at a nearby island, but due to berthing challenges the vessel was diverted to St. Maarten.\n\nPort St. Maarten accepted the vessel request as additional berths were available and the vessel docked alongside safely. \u201cOne of the strengths that the destination has had is the ability to cater to impromptu calls due to issues and or concerns at competing Ports.\n\n\u201cOur strategic plan is geared towards having more berths available in the future as MSC Cruises in particular will be the fastest growing cruise line. In 2014 MSC launched an investment plan to support the second phase of growth and in April 2016, the cruise line ordered additional vessels for a total investment of nine billion Euros for up to 11-new next-generation ships which will come into service starting in 2017 to 2026 making the cruise line the third largest.\n\n\u201cPort St. Maarten has demonstrated to be a reliable partner within the cruise sector by being able to assist where and when needed.\u00a0This approach will take us a far way.\u00a0\u00a0St. Maarten is still a marque destination and we must continue to showcase the efforts of being able to restore the country product and bring it to another and higher level than we were pre-Irma,\u201d Port St. Maarten Management said on Tuesday.\n\nMSC Divina has a gross tonnage of 139,400 and has a passenger complement of 3,500 and a crew of 1,380.\u00a0\u00a0The vessel was constructed from 2010 to 2012 and is the third ship of the four Fantasia-class cruise ships.\n\nOther scheduled ships in port on Tuesday are Harmony of the Seas which carries approximately 6,000 passengers\/2,300 crew and Disney Fantasy which carries a complement of 4,000 passengers\/1,450 crew.\n\nPort St. Maarten Management added that this unscheduled port call once again demonstrates that the country is \u2018open for business\u2019 and ready to provide that ultimate cruise passenger destination experience.\u00a0\u00a0MSC Cruises will be making 29 port calls for 2018 bringing in approximately 115,000 cruise passengers.\n\nMSC Cruises primarily attracts Europeans but also markets extensively to mainstream North American cruise travelers.\n\nThe Swiss-based world\u2019s largest privately-owned cruise line employs 15,000 staff members around the world and is present in 45 countries.\n\nMSC Cruises has a fleet of 12 ships.\u00a0\u00a0MSC Cruises is the first global cruise line brand to develop an investment plan of this length and magnitude, spanning a horizon of over 10 years, from 2014 through 2026.\n\nMSC Cruises is the brand market leader in Europe, South America and South Africa, sailing year-round in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.\u00a0\u00a0Seasonal itineraries cover northern Europe, the Atlantic Ocean, Cuba and the French Antilles, South America, southern Africa, China and Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Oman.",

This is the latest preparatory phase as the foundation is getting ready to host St. Maarten\u2019s 48th Carnival festivities.\n\nSince the close of Carnival 2016, the foundation has had a very active \u201coffseason\u201d with the election of a new president in the person of Alston Lourens, appointing new board members to the foundation, the outsourcing of its Calypso competition to Fernando Clark, the formulation of the 2017 schedule which will soon be released and dealing with several other operational matters.\n\nCarnival registration remains open until November 1.\n\nRegistration forms for all things Carnival can be found at Lourens explained that only registrations obtained through the online process will be considered valid. \u201cIn the past we often received registrations via means that were a challenge to control. Most of the business of Carnival now is done digitally. It was a natural progression for us to move the registration process online. The less paper, the better,\u201d Lourens said.\n\nRegistration for season passes is also open and payment for the pass can begin as early as October 1 instead of December 1. \u201cWith requests from many Carnival lovers to open it earlier, it was something we thought could only help as we are essentially giving the public seven months to pay for the season pass,\u201d Lourens said.\n\nAll dates for the 2017 Carnival schedule are set and ready for release. \u201cThe Carnival schedule is not easy to put together. You have to consider so many stakeholders, Easter holidays, school holidays, government input ect. It takes about a month or more to finalize a schedule. We have reached that point and we are excited about what the season will offer,\u201d Lourens said.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we had to change and implement new things for Carnival 2016 and we knew there would be resistance. But in the end, the changes were for the better and the operational structure of Carnival is better because of these changes. Is it perfect? No. The challenge of financing remains, but we still manage to host one of the best Carnivals in the entire Caribbean,\u201d Lourens said.\n\nCarnival\u2019s new email address is info.

The announcement comes just four months after the show was launched.\n\n22 February 2010 Chairman, Ray Bloom, announced that 2000 qualified buyers will now be hosted to the new Las Vegas trade show for the meetings, incentive travel and events industry - an increase of just over 30 percent on the figure announced at launch. 80% of these buyers will come from North America, with the balance attending from around the world.\n\nSays Bloom: \"Our previous figures were confident but conservative. Recent discussions with our partners and other new business alliances make it clear that that there is pent-up demand. I'm confident we will see 2000 hosted buyers at IMEX America - an increase of more than 30 percent on our previous announcement. As mentioned before, the IMEX hosted buyer program is set to be the largest of its kind for any such US trade show and unique in this regard.\"\n\nIMEX America is set to follow a completely different model to any other trade show of its kind in the US due to the scale of the hosted program. Qualification for places on the program will follow the strict guidelines that have been used to build the authority and credibility of IMEX in Frankfurt. The program will bring top quality association, corporate and agency buyers from every corner of the meetings and events industry onto the show floor to do business with exhibitors. In addition, according to the 'IMEX model' they will spend longer periods of time on the show floor meeting exhibitors compared to non-hosted trade visitors.\n\nAs Bloom explains, \"IMEX puts extremely high levels of effort and detail into making sure that only buyers who are active, serious and proven to place business attend as our hosted buyer guests. We already have some excellent partnerships with intermediaries who are similarly committed to these high standards and to driving serious business at the show. Together we place the strongest emphasis possible on getting this aspect of IMEX America absolutely right from the start. This is what our exhibitors expect and this is why IMEX has an unparalleled reputation. MPI, Site, PCMA and ASAE are just some of the most important organizations we will work with in the US to drive buyer attendance. They know and understand our unique model and are highly committed to it. Other US and international partnerships will be announced shortly.\"\n\nBloom sums up: \"Although the first IMEX America is over a year away, we have a very clear vision of what success will look like for our exhibitors, hosted buyers and trade visitors and we have a clear plan for bringing that vision to life at the Sands Expo in Las Vegas October 2011.\"\n\nFuture dates for IMEX America are also now confirmed as 9 - 11 October 2012 and 15 - 17 October 2013.\n\n\nPhoto: Ray Bloom, chairman of IMEX.",

        "text":"Mule jumping contest new to Howard County Fair\n\nDon't judge a mule's jumping capabilities based on its size alone \u2014 the little ones just might catch you by surprise, according to Howard County Fair Chairman Clint Thomas.\n\n\"Some of the shorter mules jump higher than the taller mules,\" he said.\n\nThis year, fairgoers will have the opportunity to judge for themselves, with the addition of a mule jump competition to the long list of contests traditionally offered during the two-week event.\n\nThe Howard County Fair opens its gates Saturday, Aug. 6, celebrating the county's rural roots for the 66th year.\n\nVisitors can expect the usual range of activities \u2014 carnival games and rides, food stands serving up comfort food, crafts and art exhibits, farm animals on display and a full program of contests, including everything from archery to pie eating to an amateur variety show.\n\nAnd don't forget the pig races, held four times daily.\n\nBut along with the traditional offerings come some new additions.\n\nThe coon mule jump, which will be held Tuesday, Aug. 9, after the late afternoon mule pulling contest, will feature two height classes of mules jumping over an adjustable pole. The pole will be moved up incrementally, with mules who can't clear the jump eliminated at each round.\n\nUnlike horses, mules can jump without a running start, according to Thomas, who is in charge of the contest.\n\nThomas said the fair committee decided to add the competition to the fair's offerings because Howard County has a substantial group of people who follow mule shows along the East Coast and wanted to see something offered close to home.\n\n\"Carroll County has a mule show and a jump, but there's nothing in Howard County,\" he said.\n\nThe Howard County 4-H club will also inaugurate a robotics competition this year. The group, which focuses on development of life skills in youth ages 5 to 18, has a presence throughout the fair. 4-H projects, which include raising livestock and preparing exhibits on categories as diverse as entomology, woodworking, creative writing and photography, will be on display throughout the fair.\n\nFirst-time Fair President Blair G. Hill said he took on the position because he had been involved in the 4-H club as a boy, and had been to every Howard County Fair since he was 6 or 7 years old.\n\n\"This is my opportunity to give back to the 4-H program that gave me so much,\" he said.\n\nHill said the fair this year will feature an agricultural expo, near the entrance, that will showcase \"how much agriculture is still being done in the county.\" Hill said that despite the perception that farming is on the decline in the county, it has retained a lot of nontraditional agricultural operations. \"Farming has changed,\" he said.\n\nFairgoers can also look forward to the recent installation of air conditioning in the main exhibition hall. \"We find that our fair is also the hottest week of the year,\" Hill said. \"Hopefully this will offer patrons some relief.\"\n\nLocated at the Howard County Fairgrounds in West Friendship, the fair will run through Aug. 13. The grounds open at 8 a.m. and close at 11 p.m. every day.\n\nAdmission is $5 for fairgoers 10 years and older, and $2 for seniors 62 and up. There is an extra charge for ride tickets.\n\nFor more information, visit; for updates visit\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018, Howard County Times, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad",

First held in 1823, the Easter Show is the country's largest annual ticketed event and marks the celebration of Australian culture and agricultural life.\n\nFrom feeding farm animals and watching adrenaline-filled shows to buying the legendary showbags, families with kids are guaranteed to be entertained during the 12-day event held at Sydney Olympic Park.\n\nThere's the baby puppy competition with dogs aged three to six months romping around the Dog Pavilion and capturing every kid's heart. Held every afternoon, animal lovers will adore the display as the best pup of the day is picked and awarded a trophy. To see big dogs in action, check out the agility and obedience competitions.\n\nIf you want to see which merino are producing the best-quality fleece, head to the Sheep Pavilion, open across all 12 days of the show.\n\nThe Grand Champion rams and ewes will be on display in the Supreme Exhibit on 11 April with judges scanning every detail of each competitor, including the fleece type and weight, and running ultrasounds to determine the animal's fat and muscle levels.\n\nBird lovers should visit the Pet Pavilion on Riverina Avenue. You can make some feathered friends at the Tame Parrot show, see endangered birds at the Aviary Bird Display and also learn how to talk to a parrot.\n\nIf kids are keen to learn why turtles are one of the oldest and slowest-moving reptiles in the world, they should visit the Pet Pavilion on 13 April. The one-day event will explain why the turtles' shells slow them down but also protect them from predators.\n\nTry goat yoga at the Pig and Goat Pavilion lawns and learn how to balance your chakras with a curious goat by your side. The free class will teach you some simple yoga moves.\n\nIf you don't mind slithering and scaly animals, the Frog and Reptile Show at the Pet Pavilion will be held on 13 and 14 April, and features a huge collection of non-venomous snakes, lizards and frogs.\n\nAlpacas have always been a big attraction at the Easter Show. Introduced to Australia in the late 1800s, alpacas at this year's show will be judged on their density, lustre and uniformity to determine the best fleece. The competition will be held from 10 to 14 April at the Alpaca Pavilion.\n\nBesides wood-chopping competitions, dance shows and cooking classes, there will be lots of rides for children of all ages to enjoy.\n\nLittle kids will love the Kids' Carnival.

        "text":"European Tourism Outlook Remains Strong But Staffing Challenges Threaten Recovery\n\nEurope is expected to recover 70% of pre-pandemic travel demand in 2022 but uncertainty brought about by worsening inflation, the war in Ukraine and staff shortages is clouding the outlook, according to a report published by the European Travel Commission (ETC).\n\nThe study added that long-haul travel into Europe continues to lag significantly behind the short- and medium-haul recovery\u2014and this trend is likely to continue in part because of the increasing cost of living due to energy and food price hikes.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing a much faster rebound than travel businesses in Europe had been expecting, and staff shortages may prove to be an obstacle to a complete recovery,\u201d ETC president Lu\u00eds Ara\u00fajo said.\n\n\u201cBringing back talent, and making careers in the sector more enticing, is the top priority for European tourism recovery in the months to come.\n\n\u201cIt is also crucial that the EU continues to monitor the impact of inflation on the cost of living\u2013Europe must do everything within its power to ensure that travel does not become inaccessible for the average European.\u201d\n\nETC said that for 2022 to date, Bulgaria (-8%), Serbia (-10%) and Turkey (-14%) saw the strongest rebounds in tourist arrivals. At the other end of the spectrum, Latvia\u2019s geographical proximity to Russia is slowing the country\u2019s tourism recovery from the pandemic (-63%) following mass hotel booking cancellations. Slovakia and the Czech Republic are also among the Eastern European destinations exceeding the 50% decline.\n\nHowever, the ETC and World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) has warned that Europe\u2019s travel and tourism sector recovery could be put at serious risk if almost 1.2 million jobs remain unfilled across the EU.\n\nWTTC president and CEO Julia Simpson said: \u201cEurope showed one of the strongest recoveries in 2021, ahead of the global average. However, current shortages of labour could delay this trend and put additional pressure on an already embattled sector.\n\n\u201cGovernments and the private sector need to come together to provide the best opportunities for people looking for the great career opportunities that the travel sector offers.\u201d\n\nAir transport and accommodation segments are likely to suffer one in five unfilled vacancies, representing 21% and 22% of staff shortages respectively.",

Cue the horror film music. (Via Getty Images)\n\n\"Experts estimate that in Paris there are approximately two rats for every Parisian. And in the Tuileries\u00a0gardens next to the Louvre, the furry vermin have become so used to humans, they don't even hide.\" (Via France 24)\n\nSo, that's a lot of rats. How did they all get there?\n\n\u200bIt seems people are pointing their fingers towards tourists as the party responsible for the problem. The Guardian spoke with a local gardener, who said:\n\n\"The tourists throw their scraps of pizza and sandwiches all over the place.\"\u00a0(Via The Guardian)\n\nAlthough The Local reports rats in public gardens have been an issue in the past, too.\u00a0\n\n\"For some tourists the rats are all part of the Parisian experience, thanks to Disney animation Ratatouille.\"\n\n\u00a0The movie is about a rat in Paris who aspires to become a chef. Though that rat is a lot cuter than real rats. (Via\u00a0Buena Vista Pictures \/ \"Ratatouille\")\n\nThere seems to be a slight variation in how the story is being portrayed. American outlets seem to be using the word \"infestation\" in its headlines. (Via Mashable, The Atlantic)\n\n\"They are having problems with a major infestation of them.\" (Via ABC)\n\nBut headlines from overseas were a bit more generous. While the word \"infestation\" may be used in those\u00a0articles, the headlines say things\u00a0like \"rampage\" and \"overrun.\" Although we would say \"plague\" is a bit dramatic. (Via France 24, The Guardian, The Telegraph)\n\nThe Louvre says pesticides are used regularly,\u00a0and officials have brought in outside help.\u00a0The story picked up steam after a photographer took pictures of the rats.",

On one of its spacious terrace suites, four-legged guests will find the complimentary Happy Tails Suite, where dogs can maintain their fitness regimen on motorized pet treadmills.\n\nDuring downtime, Affinia Manhattan's guest dogs can practice their winning poses at a photo session with a step and repeat, filled with entertaining props.\n\nAdditionally, guests of the Westminster Kennel Club can treat their pooches to the Doggie Delights menu at Niles New York City, the hotel's onsite restaurant.The menu includes sauteed beef tips, a 6-ounce sliced steak and 3-ounce grilled steak. Guests can also add a donation to the Humane Society of New York onto their hotel bill.\n\nThe show dogs are a special group, but there are plenty of places where your favorite furry friends can be a part of your travel adventures.\n\nFor instance, Hotel Monaco, which offers boutique accommodations in downtown Baltimore, is pet-friendly. \"We accept any number of pets without size or weight restrictions and for no extra charge,\" says a spokeswoman.\n\nAs soon as one enters the hotel, there are bowls at the front door with fresh water and dog food. An onsite pet concierge can provide a bevy of amenities. They include dog walking, name tags with hotel information and leashes, dog and cat day care, grooming services, gourmet treats at turndown, information about local dog-friendly parks and even emergency veterinarians.\n\nIn addition, any guests who are not able to travel with their pets and are missing them, may request that a goldfish be brought to their room to keep them company while traveling.\n\nOn the Eastern Shore in the town of St. Michaels, Five Gables Inn & Spa features 20 rooms and suites, each individually decorated in an elegant style featuring working gas fireplaces, antique furnishings, Jane Wilner toile linens, Frette towels and down comforters.\n\nSome rooms have private porches or balconies, and four rooms are pet-friendly, according to co-owner Bonnie Booth, who runs the property with husband John.\n\nEach dog receives use of a dog bed, special fuzzy toy and a treat.\n\nLast but not least, the inn has onsite shopping, including Flying Fred's Gifts for Pets \u2014 a boutique that offers unusual gifts for pets and pet lovers alike.

Most of us and so many residents of the Northern Neck are animal lovers, and it shines through at the resort,\" says Gordon Slatford, the hotel's general manager.\n\nSlatford says the market for pet travel continues to expand.\n\n\"Solo travelers are a growing market, and we see that these travelers like to bring pets as companions,\" says Slatford. This is especially true of destinations where travelers arrive by car.\n\n\"Drive-market destinations make it easy to bring pets along for a trip, as they make great car confidants, are comforting, familiar and help reduce stress level,\" he says.\n\nSlatford notes that hotels are finding that guests want to include their pets in all aspects of their lives. \"Pets are even being included in weddings, and they oftentimes steal the show,\" he says.\n\nIf you go\n\nWestminster Kennel Club dog show, Monday-Tuesday, New York City.

In fact Ulitao founder Ron Acfalle believes this ancient village even has an ancient stand for canoes. \u201cIt\u2019s a katsu it\u2019s a stand where the CHamorus would place their canoes on top as a symbol I suppose, but it\u2019s made out of clay and it actually has an asymmetrical design,\u201d said Acfalle.\n\nCHamoru canoes also have an asymmetrical design which is why Acfalle believes this stand is a perfect fit for their canoes. It\u2019s also a reason why the Ulitao seafaring group is a perfect fit for the Valley of the Latte. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place to have it. What more than in an ancient grounds ancestral grounds,\u201d said Acfalle.\n\nAcfalle says Ulitao\u2019s ultimate goal is still to sail a group of canoes to Hawaii for the 2020 Festival of The Pacific Arts.",

        "text":"Minister Bartlett remembers Canadian Tourism icon Edith Baxter\n\nJamaica\u2019s Tourism Minister, Hon. Edmund Bartlett has expressed deep regret at the passing of long-time friend and industry colleague Edith Baxter, co-founder and editor-in-chief of Canadian publishing group Baxter Media.\n\n\u201cI wish to offer my heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Baxter\u2019s daughter Wendy McClung, along with her extended family and the entire Baxter Media management and staff during this difficult time. Ms. Baxter was a powerful voice within the Canadian travel industry for more than five decades and her legacy will be remembered for years to come,\u201d said Minister Bartlett.\n\nEdith, or Mrs. B as she was fondly known among friends, was an unparalleled leader in Canada\u2019s travel industry. For more than 50 years, she served at the helm of Canadian Travel Press and Travel Courier \u2013 two of the country\u2019s most respected and widely read weekly travel trade publications.\n\nShe founded the prominent media group in 1968 alongside her late husband and business partner William (Bill) Henry Baxter, who passed away in 2004.\n\nReflecting on Baxter\u2019s passing, Chairman of the Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB) John Lynch said, \u201cShe will be remembered fondly as a brilliant journalist, a savvy businesswoman and a true friend of Jamaica. She made dozens of trips to the island \u2013 particularly enjoying her time at Half Moon Resort \u2013 and she developed strong friendships with former JTB Regional Directors Pat Samuels and Sandra Scott.\u201d\n\nUnder the leadership of Edith Baxter, Baxter Media has played an integral role in spotlighting Destination Jamaica in the Canadian market over the last five decades.\n\nIn 2018, Baxter was awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican government in recognition of her contributions to the tourism industry and the important work she had done behalf of Jamaica.\n\nFor the last 25 years, Baxter Media has organized the popular Canadian Travel Industry Golf Tournament, hosted on island in partnership with Sandals Resorts. The annual industry event brings dozens of travel agents, tour operators, airline representatives and tourism partners together in Jamaica for a week of networking events, friendly competition on the links and vibrant island hospitality.\n\nJamaica has also been featured prominently as an award-winning destination and tourism board at Baxter Media\u2019s annual Agents\u2019 Choice Awards, the largest and most comprehensive survey of travel agents in Canada. For 15 consecutive years, Jamaica has been named \u2018Favourite Tourist Board \u2013 Caribbean\u2019 at the annual readers\u2019 choice awards.\n\n\u201cEdith Baxter was a true trailblazer who made an enormous impact on the travel community here in Canada and beyond,\u201d recalls Angella Bennett, Regional Director, Canada, JTB.\n\n\u201cWhenever I had the pleasure of meeting with her, I always found myself in awe as she spoke about her career and shared stories of her travels to Jamaica. She had a true love affair with the island and will be dearly missed.\u201d",
