        "text":"Outreach privacy notice\n\nThe University of Birmingham works with schools and colleges to deliver outreach activities to learners who are under-represented in higher education and have the potential to progress. This work is known as widening participation.\n\nWe aim to help young people to:\n\n  \u2022 do their best at school or college by providing outreach activities to support improvements in attainment, study skills, motivation and confidence\n  \u2022 learn more about higher education, apprenticeships and other career pathways to decide on the right path for them\n\nWe do this by delivering a range of outreach activities such as University taster days, summer schools, masterclasses, study support and mentoring.\n\nThis privacy notice provides information about how the University uses the personal data we collect and process about you. It supplements our webpage\u00a0Data Protection \u2013 How the University Uses Your Data.\n\nIt is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep your personal information updated during your relationship with us.\n\nWhat personal data will be processed?\n\nWhen you apply for outreach activities\n\nWe will process the personal data you or your school provides to us when either you or your school\/college make an application for your participation within an outreach activity\/programme. This data will include some or all of the following:\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 your name, home address and other contact details you may provide\n  \u2022 your email, your user name, your computer\u2019s IP address, MAC address and device name\n  \u2022 your date of birth and year group\n  \u2022 your gender\n  \u2022 your learner ID number (UPN\/ULN)\n  \u2022 the name of your school\/college and in some cases, your previous school\/college (e.g. if you took your GCSEs there)\n  \u2022 your qualifications\/grades\n  \u2022 whether you are entitled to free school meals\n  \u2022 whether you are in care or are a care leaver\n  \u2022 whether you are a young carer\n  \u2022 information about your home life such as whether your parents\/carers have been to university and your household income). We will assume that you have obtained consent from those individuals before you supply their contact details to us.\n\nIf your school or college provides this information to us, we will assume that they have your consent to do so.\n\nIn addition to this, we may need to process some data about you that is classed as \u2018special category\u2019 or sensitive personal data. This includes data about your ethnicity and health\/disability data. Ethnicity data is important, as it enables us to carry out our statutory obligations\/conditions of funding as we need to ensure our outreach activities are targeted at learners who are under-represented in higher education. We may also request data about your health or any disability you have which will be used to provide help or reasonable adjustments at events. Access to, and the sharing of, your special category personal data are controlled very carefully. Special category data is also used for research and statistical purposes, but not in a way which will involve making any decisions about you personally or putting measures in place which relate to you personally.\n\nEngagement data and tracking outcomes\n\nIf you are accepted on to an outreach activity, we will monitor your engagement within the activities for the duration of the activity and evaluate the impact these activities have had in terms of your attainment, aspirations and where you go after school\/college.\n\n  \u2022 we will collect the outreach engagement data using registers within events\n  \u2022 from time to time you may be asked to complete evaluation forms, so that you can provide feedback on outreach activities\n\nObtaining information about you from third parties\n\nAt key points in your educational career we may ask your school\/college to provide us with information about you, such as your exam results and what qualifications you are studying and where, and education data from your Individual Learner Record (ILR) which is held by your college. We may also ask the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), University Central Admissions Service (UCAS), the Student Loans Company (SLC), and the National Pupil Database (NPD) to provide us with the following information from your ILR:\n\n  \u2022 your attainment at school\/college\n  \u2022 if you have\/are receiving free school meals\n  \u2022 if you have a disability and your ethnic group\n  \u2022 the type\/level of course you are studying\n  \u2022 whether you went to university\n\nWe may also monitor and track your outcomes from this information if you have not engaged in outreach activities. This will allow us to compare your outcomes against outcomes of other learners that have engaged in outreach activities to support planning and help evidence which outreach activities are most effective. We may ask HESA, UCAS, SLC and NPD and\/or your school\/college to provide data on your background characteristics (e.g. from the school census), attainment and post-16 progression data (e.g. did you stay on in sixth form\/go to college\/go to university).\n\nWhat is the purpose of the processing?\n\nWe will process your personal data in order to deliver our outreach and widening participation activities and agenda which includes:\n\n  \u2022 considering the suitability of your application for the outreach event\/programme to which you or your school\/college has applied\n  \u2022 enabling you to take part in outreach events and activities, including putting in place any support which is appropriate and managing those events and activities\n  \u2022 monitoring your subsequent engagement with those activities\n  \u2022 communicating effectively with you or your school\/college by post, email, phone or other electronic media, including the communication of our decision on your application to take part in an outreach activity\/programme\n  \u2022 accessing national data sets and identify if you progressed to higher education\n  \u2022 responding to any queries about your participation within outreach activities\n  \u2022 fulfilling our analysis and reporting obligations (e.g. monitoring your engagement in outreach activities to see if they have made a positive difference to your attainment and post 16 progression)\n  \u2022 to enable us to contact others in the event of an emergency (we will assume that you have checked with the individuals before you supply their contact details to us)\n\nWhen you apply for an outreach programme\/activity, we:\n\n  \u2022 check if you are eligible to attend\n  \u2022 track your engagement within activities\n  \u2022 track your outcomes via local and national data sets\n  \u2022 evaluate the impact of your engagement within outreach activities\n\nWhen we have collected data about you from third parties (see Obtaining Information About your from Third Parties), that data will be matched together with data we hold to enable us to establish the impact of our activities\/programmes and report to our funders\/make statutory returns (e.g. the Office for Students). This data is not used to make decisions about you, including whether you can participate in further activities.\n\nWe will use your data to prepare aggregated and anonymised evaluation reports to enable us to carry out future statistical analysis on the impact of outreach activities\/programmes on learners from different socio-economic backgrounds or for historical or research purposes or to meet such reporting obligations as may be imposed on the University by relevant authorities, for example the Office for Students.\n\nVideo conferencing applications\n\nWhen using video conferencing applications, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, personal data such as your IP address and device name may collected by the companies who own these applications in order to schedule and create a record of meetings, improve and tailor your experience when using these applications. Where video conferencing applications are used to record meetings, personal data captured within the recording are stored within the cloud service owned by that company. Where recording is taking place, you will be notified at the beginning of or as you enter the recording session.\n\nData held and used by the University are compliant with GDPR. Personal data stored by a service provider within the cloud may be stored outside of the European Economic Area.\n\nWhat is the legal basis of the processing?\n\nProcessing of your personal data is carried because it is necessary:\n\n  \u2022 to perform our outreach activities and programmes, which are tasks we carry out in the public interest\n  \u2022 to deliver the outreach programme you have applied for in accordance with our contractual obligations\n  \u2022 to comply with a legal obligation (e.g. equal opportunities monitoring) or regulatory obligation (e.g. reporting to Government or governmental bodies)\n\nWe will only process special category data with your explicit consent or if it is necessary:\n\n  \u2022 for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes\n  \u2022 to perform our outreach activities in the substantial public interest where the law allows us to do so and in line with our Data Protection Policy\n  \u2022 very occasionally, when it is needed to protect your vital interests and you are not capable of giving their consent (for example, in an emergency)\n  \u2022 for the establishment, exercise or defence of any legal claims\n\nIf your consent (or that of your parent\/carer) is required for any specific use of your personal data, we will collect it at the appropriate time, explaining why we are collecting the data and how we will use it, and you can withdraw this at any time. Sometimes your school\/college will collect this before forwarding information about you to us.\n\nWho will your personal data be shared with?\n\nWithin the University, your data is shared with only those University staff who need access to it to deliver and support our outreach programmes and activities.\n\nYour personal data is shared with a range of external organisations as is necessary for the purposes set out above and as p...

Seblum naskah diupload sebaiknya penulis melakukan plagiarisme sendiri dan diupload bersama naskah yang akan diupload. Naskah yang diserahkan akan dievaluasi, apakah itu cocok untuk fokus dan ruang lingkup kami atau memiliki kelemahan metodologis utama yang tidak dapat ditoleransi. Setiap makalah yang disampaikan akan ditinjau oleh setidaknya satu peer-reviewer. Reviewer tidak menyadari identitas penulis, dan penulis juga tidak mengetahui identitas peninjau (double-blind review method). Proses peninjauan akan mempertimbangkan pendahuluan, sumber inspirasi, metoda, dampak bagi masyarakat, ulasan, dan kesimpulan. Keputusan yang disarankan akan dievaluasi dalam rapat dewan editorial.

More...\n\n\nPublication Ethics\n\nJurnal Akses\u00a0Pengabdian\u00a0Indonesia is a peer-reviewed journal. This statement explains the ethical behavior of all parties involved in the publishing action of articles in this journal, including authors, editor-in-chiefs, Editorial Boards, peer reviewers and publishers (UNITRI\u00a0PRESS). This statement is based on the Best Practices Guidance for COPE Journal Editors.\n\nEthical Guidelines for Journal Publications\n\nPublication of articles in the journal Jurnal Akses\u00a0Pengabdian\u00a0Indonesia examined by peers is an important building block in the development of a coherent and respected network of knowledge. This is a direct reflection of the work quality of the authors and the institutions that support them. The reviewed articles support and embody scientific methods. It is therefore important to agree on the expected ethical standards of conduct for all parties involved in publishing actions: authors, journal editors, peer reviewers, publishers and the public.\n\nUNITRI\u00a0PRESS as a publisher of Jurnal\u00a0Akses\u00a0Pengabdian\u00a0Indonesia carries out its trust duties for all stages of publication very seriously and we recognize ethical and other responsibilities. We are committed to ensuring that advertising, reprints, or other commercial revenue have no impact or effect on editorial decisions. In addition, UNITRI\u00a0PRESS\u00a0 of the University Tribhuwana Tunggadewi and the Editorial Board will assist in communication with other journals and \/ or publishers where this is useful and necessary.\n\nPublication Decision\n\nEditor Jurnal Akses\u00a0Pengabdian\u00a0Indonesia is responsible for deciding which articles are submitted to the journal to be published. The validation of the work in question and its importance to researchers and readers should always encourage such decisions. Editors can be guided by the policy of the editorial board of the journal and are limited by the legal requirements as currently applicable with respect to defamation, copyright infringement and plagiarism. Editors can negotiate with editors or other reviewers in making this decision.\n\nThe game is fair\n\nThe editor at any time evaluates the manuscripts for their intellectual content irrespective of race, sex, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, nationality, or political philosophy of the author.\n\n\nThe editor and any editorial staff should not disclose any information about the manuscript submitted to anyone other than the relevant author, observer, potential observer, other editorial advisor, and publisher, as appropriate.\n\nDisclosure and conflict of interest\n\nUnpublished material disclosed in submitted manuscripts may not be used in the research editors themselves without the written consent of the author.\n\nViewer's Tasks\n\nContributions to Editorial Decisions\n\nPeer reviews help editors in making editorial decisions and through editorial communication with authors can also assist authors in improving papers.\n\n\nAny elected referee who feels ineligible to review research reported in the script or knows that a quick review may not have to notify the editor and excuse himself from the review process.\n\n\nManuscripts received for review should be treated as confidential documents. They may not be indicated or discussed with others except as authorized by the editors.\n\nStandards of Objectivity\n\nThe review should be done objectively. The personal criticism of the author is not correct. Referees should express their views clearly with supporting arguments.\n\nSource Recognition\n\nReviewers shall identify relevant published works that have not been quoted by the author. Any statement that observation, derivation, or argument has been previously reported should be accompanied by relevant citations. The reviewer should also seek the editor's attention if there are substantial or overlapping similarities between the text under consideration and other published papers that have personal knowledge.\n\nDisclosure and Conflict of Interest\n\nSpecial information or ideas obtained through peer review should be kept confidential and not used for personal gain. Reviewers may not consider manuscripts in which they have a conflict of interest resulting from competition, collaboration, or other relationships or relationships with any of the authors, companies, or agencies linked to the paper.\n\nAuthor's Duties\n\nStandard reporting\n\nThe author of the original research report must present an accurate report on the work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance. The underlying data should be accurately represented in the paper. A paper should contain sufficient details and references to enable others to replicate the work. Fraudulent or intentionally inaccurate statements are unethical and unacceptable behavior.\n\nData Access and Retention\n\nAuthors are required to provide raw data in connection with papers for editorial reviews, and must be prepared to provide public access to the data (consistently), where possible, and should be in any event. be prepared to keep the data for a reasonable time after publication.\n\nOriginality and Plagiarism\n\nThe authors shall ensure that they have written works which are completely original, and if the author has used the work and \/ or the words of others that have been quoted or quoted appropriately.\n\nDuplicate, Redundant, or Simultaneous Publication\n\nA writer should not generally publish a script that explains essentially the same research in more than one major journal or publication. Sending the same script to more than one journal simultaneously is unethical and unacceptable publishing behavior.\n\nSource Recognition\n\nAppropriate recognition of the work of others must always be given. The author should cite publications that have been influential in determining the nature of the work reported.\n\nPaper Stamps\n\nAuthors should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, implementation, or interpretation of reported research. Anyone who has made a significant contribution should be registered as a coauthor. Where there are others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of a research project, they must be recognized or registered as contributors. The appropriate author must ensure that all appropriate co-authors and no coauthor are incorporated on paper, and that all co-authors have reviewed and approved the final version of this paper and have approved the submission for publication.\n\nDisclosure and Conflict of Interest\n\nAll authors should disclose in their text any financial conflicts or other substantive conflicts that may be interpreted to influence the outcome or interpretation of their manuscript. All sources of financial support for the project should be disclosed.\n\nFundamental mistake in published work\n\nWhen a writer finds significant errors or inaccuracies in his published work, it is the duty of the writer to immediately notify the journal or publisher editors and work with the editor to retract or correct the paper.\n\n\n\n\nPlagiarism Policy\n\nPlagiarism Policy\nPlagiarism Includes But Unlimited to:\n\nReferring and \/ or quoting terms, words and \/ or sentences, data and \/ or information from a source without citing sources in the citation notes and \/ or without adequately mentioning the source;\nReferring and \/ or citing random terms, words and \/ or sentences, data and \/ or information from sources without quoting sources in citation notes and \/ or without adequately mentioning sources;\nUsing the source of ideas, opinions, views, or theories without adequately declaring the source;\nFormulate the words and \/ or sentences themselves from the source of words and \/ or phrases, ideas, opinions, views, or theories without adequately declaring the source;\nSubmit a scientific paper produced and \/ or published by others as a source of scientific work without adequately disclosing it.\n\n\nJurnal\u00a0Akses\u00a0Pengabdian\u00a0Indonesia will ensure that any published article will not exceed 20% equality score.
