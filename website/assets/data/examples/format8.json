COWAN, et al., 5:96-CV-0224-C, USDC, ND\/TX (Lubbock Division) The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") announced that on June 2, 1997, an Agreed Final Judgment was entered against Robert C. Cowan (\"Cowan\"), individually and doing business as CS Investments Trust (\"CSI\"), and Cowan Asset Management, Inc., (\"CAMI\"), an investment adviser registered with the Commission. The Agreed Final Judgment permanently enjoins Cowan, individually and doing business as CSI, from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Cowan and CAMI are permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder, and Cowan is permanently enjoined from aiding and abetting any CAMI violations. The Court also ordered Cowan to pay disgorgement in the amount of $3,080,418, plus prejudgment interest. However, this amount will be reduced by the value of the assets Cowan surrendered to the Special Master, the final total of which will be determined in the Special Master's final report. Based on Cowan's demonstrated financial inability to pay, the Court waived collection of whatever disgorgement amount remains after the value of Cowan's assets turned over to the Special Master has been deducted. Additionally, based on Cowan's financial condition, the Court will not order him to pay a civil penalty. According to the complaint filed on November 5, 1996, Cowan raised between $1 million and $3 million from his customers for the purpose of purchasing trust units in CSI. In fact, according to the complaint, CSI does not exist, apart from Cowan's misrepresentations and created records, and does not hold securities or funds for customers; rather, Cowan used customers' funds for his personal expenses, and to satisfy periodic payments and redemptions for his customers as part of a \"ponzi\" scheme. ======END OF PAGE 1======",

We use the term \u201cDesignated Countries\u201d to refer to Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and all countries located in the European continent. We refer to MB Atlasmic collectively as \u201cAtlasmic\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d throughout these Terms.\n\n2. Your account\n\nWhere use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account and keep the information current. This is important because sometimes we may need to send you notable updates (for example, about changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or we may want to let you know about and make informed choices in response to legal inquiries or complaints.\nYou will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your account. You are responsible for keeping your account information up-to-date and for keeping your password secure.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any Service-related content, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.\nWhen you create an Atlasmic account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may contact you to share more details about what we have to offer. Don't worry -- if you aren't interested in learning more, you can opt out of the marketing communication, whether it's an email, phone call, or text message.\n\n3. Minimum age requirements\n\nOur Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for or use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older (or 16 years or older in the European Union).\n\n4. Responsibility of visitors and users\n\nWe have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the content (such as, but not limited to, text, photo, video, audio, code, computer software, items for sale, or other materials) posted to our Services by users or anyone else (\u201cContent\u201d) and are not responsible for any use or effects of such Content. So, for example:\n  \u2022 We do not endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or non-harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights (see our Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy section to submit copyright complaints), or other proprietary rights of third parties.\n  \u2022 If you post Content, comment on a website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) Content available on our Services, you are entirely responsible for the Content, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct.\n  \u2022 We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone\u2019s use, purchase, or downloading of Content. If you access or use any Content, you are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.\n  \u2022 We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.\n  \u2022 Please note that additional third party terms and conditions may apply to the downloading, copying, purchase, or use of Content.\nWe also have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and web pages that link to, or are linked from, Atlasmic or our other Services. For example:\n  \u2022 We do not have any control over those websites and are not responsible for their contents or their use.\n  \u2022 The existence of a link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse such website.\n  \u2022 You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.\n  \u2022 We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from non-Atlasmic websites.\n\n5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal\n\nFees for Paid Services.\nSome of our Services are offered for a fee,such as Atlasmic plans, and some paid apps (collectively, \u201cPaid Services\u201d). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees, and fees associated with specific features. These fees may be one-time fees, recurring fees, or revenue-based fees. For recurring fees, we\u2019ll bill or charge you for in regular automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.\nDepending on which billing option you choose (like monthly vs. annually), there may be different features available or policies that apply to your Paid Service.\nTo the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future (\u201cTaxes\u201d). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you\u2019ve paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.\nIf your payment fails, Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, or we suspect a payment is fraudulent, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services.\nAutomatic renewal.\nTo ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, if you purchase an Atlasmic annual plan, you will be charged each year for the following 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you are checking your email (including any spam or other filters) in order to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of renewal. The date for the automatic renewal is determined automatically based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. You can view your renewal date for Atlasmic Paid Services by visiting your workspace settings billing page.\nCancelling automatic renewal.\nYou can manage and cancel your Paid Services at the respective Service\u2019s site. For example, you can manage each workspace Atlasmic plan through its respective billing page in workspace settings.\nTo cancel a Atlasmic plan, go to your workspace billing page and click \"Cancel plan\". You must repeat this process for each workspace plan you wish to cancel.\nFee changes.\nWe may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were previously free. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don\u2019t agree with the fee changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.\nWhile you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless otherwise required by applicable law.\n\n6. General representation and warranty\n\nYou represent and warrant that your use of our Services:\n  \u2022 Will be in strict accordance with these Terms;\n  \u2022 Will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, all applicable laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, privacy, data protection, the transmission of technical data exported from the the country in which you reside, the use of financial services, notific...
