        "text":"Press Releases\n\nEpson launches new MeetingMate Interactive Finger Touch-enabled Multi-function Projectors for Business\n\nAugust 2014\n\nNew EB-1420Wi and EB-1430Wi models\n\nSYDNEY, 20 August 2014 \u2013 Epson today again raised the bar in the business world with the launch of its second-generation EB-1420Wi and EB-1430Wi MeetingMate interactive, multi-function, finger touch-enabled projectors that completely remove the need for any kind of whiteboard.\n\nThe new MeetingMate models not only capitalise on the incredible success of the first generation projectors, but add to it in many ways with the EB-1430Wi becoming the world\u2019s first finger touch-based interactive projector aimed squarely at the world of business. Such is the ingenuity of the EB-1430Wi that it enables as many as six participants to touch, draw, select and interact using intuitive and familiar gestures. In addition to operation using an interactive pen, with the EB-1430Wi it is now possible for users to operate by simply using their fingers on the screen. Much like many of today\u2019s tablet devices opening and closing files, scrolling, moving and expanding objects, and annotation are just some of the possibilities available at the touch of a finger. What\u2019s more any image on the screen can be resized and moved as if it were an object. So, even if there is no writing space on the screen, written contents can be reduced in size to make room for new annotations.\n\nEpson Australia General Manager for its Business Division Craig Heckenberg said, \u201cThe new MeetingMate projectors revolutionise any whiteboard, wall, flat surface or existing dryerase board as it makes them a truly interactive and powerful business tool. Simply turn on the projector and start writing. It\u2019s that easy.\u201d\n\nMeetingMate is a standalone solution that requires no computer, software or training. Designed in close collaboration with business professionals in mind MeetingMate offers the ability to capture, save and share everything that transpires within the meeting at the simple touch of a button, pen or finger. There is no need to transcribe whiteboard notes or take a photo as MeetingMate is set up to print or email directly from the screen.\n\nThe second generation MeetingMate offers far more than its predecessor too including the ability to save up to 50 fully digital pages removing the need to erase for more space. There\u2019s also a whiteboard sharing mode which enables content written digitally to be shared and annotated on simultaneously by both local and remote participants collaborating from mobile devices, computers and other MeetingMates without connecting a PC. This unique feature can be used for document revision, adding handwritten signatures, modifying charts and highlighting key information.\n\nThe networking capabilities of MeetingMate are second to none and add power and flexibility to meetings and presentations the like of which hasn\u2019t been seen before in a projector. By attaching them to a LAN via a wired or wireless connection MeetingMate\u2019s network-connected projectors not only allow users to present visual and audio content over the LAN, but also to annotate on network content using Epson's instant annotation tools. Using the EasyMP\u00ae Network Projection application allows users to project a presentation via a maximum of 4 network connected projectors anywhere in the world and enables individual mouse control from each location. In addition and to add more practicality into the mix, IT administrators can also configure and monitor the status of their Epson networked projectors, including the remote viewing of power status, lamp hours, temperature and filter conditions and maintenance alerts.\n\nEnhanced interactivity is the key feature of the new MeetingMate which it delivers on many levels. By connecting the projectors to a PC via USB cable, users can operate the PC mouse using the interactive pen and even your finger with the EB-1430Wi. When used with Microsoft Office (Windows Vista or later), users can handwrite comments and diagrams directly into the document then save it in the original file format.\n\nBy using the unique Epson iProjection\u2122 App and for even more added convenience, MeetingMate now also allows users to use their own device and wirelessly share and display content from iPhone\u00ae, iPad\u00ae and Android\u2122 devices to MeetingMate projectors.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the bar has been raised even further as MeetingMate now employs a dynamic video conferencing display enabling users to connect video conferencing equipment for screens up to 100 inches in size and uses Split Screen to simultaneously display people and content side by side. All MeetingMate projectors use low cost Epson lamps and have a powerful 16W built-in speaker.\n\nImages are also brighter and clearer with the new MeetingMate as each projector now boasts 3,300 lumens white brightness and colour brightness. The projectors\u2019 lamp life has also been extended now giving up to 6,000 hours in ECO mode. MeetingMate projectors also have a higher contrast ratio than before at 10,000:1 and increased practical digital connectivity with two HDMI ports for digital connections, one of which supports MHL (Mobile High Definition Link) for mirroring connectivity with Android\u2122 mobile devices.\n\nRRP for the new MeetingMate projectors inclusive of GST are EB-1420Wi $3,299 and EB-1430Wi $3,699 and both models are available now from authorised Epson dealers.\n\nFor more information on the new MeetingMate multi-function interactive projectors go to:\n\nThe new multi-function, interactive EB-1420Wi and EB-1430Wi MeetingMate projectors will be demonstrated at Integrate 2014 on Epson\u2019s stand E30 from 26-28 August at the Sydney Showground, Sydney Olympic Park.\n\nBack Press Releases\n\nInternational Press Releases\n\nRead them at:",

        "text":"Mentor Graphics Enhances MicReD Industrial Power Tester with 4X Component Power Cycling and Thermal Testing Capabilities\n\nWILSONVILLE, Ore., May 11, 2015 \u2014 (PRNewswire) \u2014 \u00a0 Mentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ: MENT) today announced \u00a0its next-generation MicReD\u00ae Industrial Power Tester 1500A product, which provides electronics components power cycling and thermal testing for up to 12 devices simultaneously. The MicReD Industrial Power Tester 1500A is the industry's only commercially available thermal testing product combining both power cycling and thermal transient structure function analysis for real-time failure-in-progress data for diagnostics.\u00a0 Based on market feedback and the success of the MicReD Power Tester 1500A three-channel product, Mentor Graphics has enhanced the product to accommodate more device testing for greater productivity and lifecycle performance, which will benefit industries such as automotive systems, hybrid and electrical vehicles, trains, power generation and converters, and renewable energy products.\n\nThe Mentor Graphics(R) MicReD(R) Industrial Power Tester 1500A is now available with 12 channels for simultaneous power cycling and thermal testing of electronic components for lifetime performance.\n\nReliability is a key concern in these industries that use high-power electronics, so accelerated testing of these modules through a lifetime of cycles (tens of thousands, potentially millions) is critical for the component supplier, the system supplier, and the OEM. Power components are used for applications where electrical energy is generated, converted, or controlled and where very high reliability is required during many years of constant operation.\n\n\"Advanced thermal management is crucial for the design of power modules and power electronics packages,\" said Chang-Sheng Chen, manager, power devices packaging technology department, Advanced Package Technology Division, Electronics and Opto-Electronics Research Laboratories at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). \"Our partners use thinner and thermally more conductive TIMs, new substrate materials and new interconnect technologies to decrease thermal resistance and increase the lifetime of their products. Power cycling tests are required to gather information about the lifetime and possible failure modes of these new devices; however, in order to have reliable data, statistical analysis is important. The new MicReD Power Tester 1500A with 12 channels can increase the throughput of our power tester by four times, allowing us to finish our projects significantly faster.\"\n\nThe award-winning MicReD Industrial Power Tester 1500A can perform power cycling tests of metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and power diodes. Both power cycling and thermal transient measurements are conducted without needing to remove the components from the test environment. \u00a0Measurements of both top and bottom transistors in half-bridge structures can be achieved at the same time. The MicReD Power Tester 1500A provides a user-friendly touch-screen interface and can record a broad range of information during test, such as current, voltage and die temperature sensing, as well as detailed structure function analysis to record changes in the package's thermal structure. A technician or engineer is able to see the failure as it progresses and determine the exact time\/cycle and cause.\u00a0 This makes it an ideal platform for package development and quality checking of incoming parts before production.\n\n\"We are committed to serving the needs of our customers, particularly automotive and transportation customers, who have asked us to expand the productivity of the MicReD Industrial Power Tester 1500A,\" stated Roland Feldhinkel, general manager of the \u00a0Mechanical Analysis Division at Mentor Graphics. \"Knowing that their electronic components will perform to optimum standards is crucial for their success. Using the MicReD Power Tester gives our customers added confidence by helping them develop and validate both electronic parts and batches of parts for manufacturing with greater performance reliability.\"\n\nProduct Availability\nThe MicReD Industrial Power Tester 1500A with 12 channel capability is available today.

Using free software from Sekonic and X-Rite, this new bundle enables photographers and cinematographers to quickly and easily create an exposure profile of their cameras, calibrate their meters and create color profiles that deliver the very best images.\n\n\u201cCreating great images and videos just got easier, faster and more fun,\u201d states Phil Bradon, Sekonic\u2019s USA Marketing Manager. \u201cThat\u2019s because Sekonic and X-Rite have teamed up to simplify the process of getting the best exposures and truest colors \u2013 the most challenging aspects for today\u2019s image makers.

The new AWA-0213-PAK is 28 GHz band (n257\/n261) Active Antenna built upon Anokiwave\u2019s\u00a0third generation silicon ICs and features the performance of their patented Zero-Cal\u00ae at an array level. The Innovator Kit includes a complete mmWave to IF active antenna, PCB, connectors for IF and LO connections all enclosed in a passively cooled enclosure with power and digital interfaces.\u00a0\n\nDesign of mmWave phased array active antennas continues to be a major technical challenge for most OEMs, system integrators and radio manufacturers; most struggle to develop good working arrays especially in a fast-evolving 5G market. Anokiwave envisions these new antenna innovator kits along with its high performance silicon ICs will allow radio manufacturers to develop high performance mmWave 5G radios, at a commercial scale and at a much faster pace.\n\nThese kits offer manufacturers with:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0A real working evidence of the near ideal performance they can achieve using Anokiwave\u2019s ICs\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0A starting platform to scale the design to meet each specific use case. Eventually each radio manufacturer will design, customize and develop their antennas, based on these Innovator Kits, to meet their specific radio requirements.\n\n\u201cAnokiwave designed, developed and tested these Active Antennas 100 percent in-house, in a third of the time of a typical commercial active antenna development, and achieved near ideal performance in the first pass design. This speaks to the decades of mmW active antenna expertise the company has developed,\u201d stated Abhishek Kapoor, vice president of sales. \u201cAnokiwave itself is a fabless semiconductor IC company, with the goal to provide enabling ICs for mmWave active antennas; our customers are the ones that design and deliver 5G radios. We hope these kits will provide them with another tool and a starting platform to accelerate their radio developments while offering complete flexibility on every aspect of their radio design.\u201d",

        "text":"Manila Gear Introduces the 2soniq and Announces New Partnership with ReActiveMicro\n\nMountain View, CA, 7 April 2017 \u2014 Manila Gear today announced the 2soniq interface card for the Apple IIGS. The card gives IIGS owners the ability to connect 2 powered speakers so they can enjoy stereophonic sound. This is a simpler version of the 4soniq \u2013 the quadraphonic sound card with a monophonic input digitizer that the company released almost a year ago.\n\n2soniq Stereo Sound Card\n\nHardware \u2013 The 2soniq unlocks the capabilities already available in the Apple IIGS\u2019 Ensoniq Digital Oscillator Chip. The simple design and robust engineering delivers clean, reliable sound. It features 2 channel output via one 3.5 mm stereo jack. Similar to the 4soniq, the 2soniq can also be setup for slotless operation.\n\nSoftware \u2013 The 4soniq Programmer\u2019s Guide is available on the Manila Gear website. The guide shows developers how to program for both the 2soniq and the 4soniq, and includes sample code on how to modify existing software to support multi-channel sound.\n\nThe 2soniq is now on sale for $69++ at the ReActiveMicro online store at\n\nFor more information on the card specifications please visit\n\nNew Partnership with ReActiveMicro\n\nIn February 2017, Manila Gear contacted ReActiveMicro about working together to bring their projects to the Apple II Community. Manila Gear wanted to make sure their current and future products continue to be available to the community at scale. ReActiveMicro was Manila Gear\u2019s first choice since they are the most experienced and longest lived Apple II vendor currently active in the Apple II Community.\n\nStarting from April 2017, ReActiveMicro will be selling and supporting all the great items available from Manila Gear. These will include the new 2soniq stereo sound card, the popular Apple IIGS VGA Adapter, and a refreshed version of the 4soniq 4-channel sound card.\n\n4soniq 4-channel sound card\n\nApple IIGS VGA Adapter\n\n\nManila Gear is an electronics company founded by Jon Christopher Co and John Valdezco. Jon has been a hardware hacker for the past twenty years and maintains a blog at John advises Silicon Valley startups, and has a degree in Electrical Engineering. Both Jon and John attended Philippine Science High School, and have been working together on cool stuff since then.\n\nReActiveMicro was formed by Henry S. Courbis in 2005 as a division of Reactive. Since 1990 the parent company Reactive has had many different divisions. They have worked with hardware, custom software, auto security and sound, auto repair, pay phones and electronics to name a few. Henry\u2019s current project at Reactive Computers is related to the Apple II and Arcade systems.

        "text":"Connectivity Technology by Belden Already Meets Future PROFINET Standard for 24-Volt Power Supply\n\nNew L-coded M12 Power Connectors Stand Out with their Compact Design, High Current-Carrying Capacity and Connectability to Functional Ground\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri - October 27, 2016 - Belden Inc., a global leader in signal transmission solutions for mission-critical applications, has developed Lumberg Automation M12 Power Connectors as an economical solution for power transmission in harsh environments.\n\nAt its technical strategy meeting this September, PROFINET International (PI) decided that the L-coded variant, which is internationally standardized through the standard 61076-2-111, will be the future single standard for 24-volt PROFINET devices with round connectors. The key factors behind this decision were compact design and its high current-carrying capacity (16A) at a conductor cross section of 1.5 mm\u00b2.\n\nIn addition, L-coded M12 Power Connectors for PROFINET devices in a TN-S system can be connected via the fifth contact for the functional ground to a Common Bonding Network (CBN), a meshed grounding concept in accordance with DIN EN 50310.\n\nIn the current PROFINET guideline \u201cPROFINET Cabling and Interconnection Technology,\u201d two round connectors with screw connections are specified for the 24-volt power supply in addition to a push-pull rectangular connector. This is an A-coded M12 connector for power class 1 to 4 A; the version with a 7\/8\u201d connection is for power class 2 to 16 A.\n\n\u201cIn the future PROFINET guideline, which is expected to be published in April 2017, these two variants will be replaced by the L-coded M12-Power Connectors,\u201d explains Uwe Widmann, responsible for standardization and technology at Belden, Germany.\n\n\u201cThis connection technology is more powerful and is almost 50 percent smaller than other comparable power connectors. This miniaturization has also been applied to PROFINET devices, so future PROFINET networks can be built more flexibly and efficiently.\u201d\n\nThe L-coded M12 Power Connectors of the Lumberg Automation brand are approved in accordance with UL and VDE, and are offered in both straight and angled versions, as well as molded, for customer assembly or as an installation variant. They have an extended operating temperature range of -40\u00b0C to +125\u00b0C and are available with protection classes IP65, IP67 or IP69K. The five-pin versions with functional ground are clearly recognizable by a gray cable jacket and gray contact carriers for pins and sockets.\n\nFor more information on the Lumberg Automation L-coded M12 Power Connectors, visit:\n\nReader enquiries\n\nP.O. Box 9\n+31 77 387 8555\n\nNotes for editors\n\nIn a world moving toward new levels of interoperability made possible by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), visibility is vital to operators as they face increasing demands to receive, analyze and share data.
