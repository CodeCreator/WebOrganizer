        "text":"Whatever It Takes\n\nChristopher Wong's Whatever It Takes chronicles the struggles and triumphs of the very first year of the Bronx Center for Science & Mathematics, an innovative public high school set in NYC's South Bronx. This deeply emotional, character-driven documentary focuses on Edward Tom, the school's dynamic rookie principal, and Sharifea Baskerville, a talented but troubled ninth-grade girl.\n\nThe personal stories of this school's students and staff call to mind larger themes of school reform and the need for educators, parents, and policymakers to prioritize the transformation of the public school system so that all children can receive a quality education. Grittily realistic, yet ultimately triumphant, Whatever It Takes paints a compelling picture of cutting-edge ideas and dedicated individuals, united in their vision to restore hope to a broken community.\n\nDirector Christopher Wong will also be in attendance at many of the screenings with special appearances from the main character of the film: Principal Edward Tom.\n\nToronto, Canada\nCarlton Cinemas\n20 Carlton Street @ Yonge St.\nToronto, ON M5B 2H5\n\nScreening Times:\nFriday, Sept 24 - Thursday, Sept 30\n1:00pm, 3:10 p.m., 5:30 p.m., 7:30 p.m., 9:45 p.m.\n\nLead photo:",

His musical career began in 1943, when at the age of 16 he joined the Stan Kenton Orchestra, holding that demanding spot for more than eleven years. In 1954, Buddy settled on the West Coast where he also began playing in small groups, developing a subtle warm sound, and emerging as a very sensitive soloist with a lot of feeling and creativity. Since then he alternated in both those roles. However, although his name as a leader of the brass section appeared in countless recordings, the present sides are the only ones he made leading his own group during the Fifties. You will agree that they are a fine showcase for the trumpet style of Buddy Childers.\n\n\n01. Thank you Sam (Childers) 3:26\n02. Honeysuckle Sam (Childers) 2:53\n03.

Following up the \u2018Days Gone By\u2019 LP from 2011 that quickly sold out it\u2019s first pressing (and is steadily selling through a second pressing), this album is set to be bigger and better! With evolving and improved song-writing and production quality, this album covers a range of subject matter including classism, societal ills and a nostalgic look back to the past with the previously released single \u2018Songs Of Yesterday\u2019. Do not be misled by the more refined production though as this band is still driven by their punk rock roots and maintain their energy and passion and play with true grit as always\u2026 Since they formed in 2002, MARCHING ORDERS have been at the forefront of the Australia skinhead and streetpunk scene that is currently on the ascendency which includes other bands like RUST, THE CORPS and SLICK 46 to name a few. This new wave of Australian rock\u2019n\u2019roll could put Australia back on the map like their predecessors ROSE TATTOO and AC\/DC did before them! Contra Records 2013 Tracklisting: SIDE ONE: 01.

Constructed in an incessant twenty-four hour a day, seven day a week mania for decades, it stands seven stories tall and contains hundreds of rooms. To the outsider it looks like a monstrous monument to a disturbed woman's madness.

Like the small cabin where they recorded it, the record has an intimate feel, and their songs ask intimate questions about that most intimate of places \u2014 home. Home on Earth and home in Heaven.\n\nShad Cobb guests on fiddle while the duo handle the other instruments including guitar, banjo, mandolin, harmonica, and acoustic bass guitar. Like their Jewell Ridge Coal, Longing for Heaven features live vocals and instruments recorded in complete takes with minimal overdubs to capture that \u201csitting in the living room at home\u201d feel. Nicole Levitz (Feminist Review) writes, \u201cThey sound so natural together, it feels calming and clear. It\u2019s as if you were there sitting on a back porch in old-timey South and they were right there with you and just stumbled upon some instruments.\u201d\n\nBuy Now This ten-track CD includes four traditional songs: one from the Sacred Harp tradition and the others learned at fiddler\u2019s conventions and from Dr. Ralph Stanley and Dry Branch Fire Squad records. The traditional song \u201cFond Affection\u201d is recreated with additional lyrics and a new melody with a sad and delicate banjo lead. The other five songs are originals.\n\nSouthern writer Lee Smith, says she needs a mountain to rest her eyes against. An homage to Smith\u2019s novels, \u201cThe Ballad of Sally Kincaid\u201d asks the age-old question of whether you can go home again and what a woman will bear to be near \u201cthe mountain she loved best.\u201d\n\n\u201cFather Will You Meet Me in Heaven\u201d tells the true life story of Jack Cash, Johnny\u2019s brother, who brought his father to Jesus while he lay dying of a saw-blade wound.\n\nWritten in the style of the old Carter Family songs, \u201cWhile I Stay at Home and Weep\u201d takes the age-old story of a woman waiting for her ramblin\u2019 lover and stands it on its head.\n\nIn \u201cIf I Ever Get Ten Dollars\u201d the railroad hobo lays out all his plans to \u201cquit this railway car\u201d and settle down \u2014 if he can just find the dough to buy a suit, a ring, and some land.\n\nJeni & Billy met UMWA President, Cecil Roberts, at the unveiling of a miner\u2019s memorial in Cumberland, KY, after which he invited them to play at his 2010 inauguration. Struck by Roberts\u2019 fiery speeches and his devotion to Martin Luther King, Jr and Jesus, Jeni & Billy wrote \u201cCecil Roberts\u2019 Hand\u201d in his honor.",

        "text":"Ronniepalooza! with The Better Half\n\nThe Better Half\n\nThe Better Half are a straight-ahead rock 'n' roll band from Philadelphia. With a melody-driven hard rock sound, The Better Half are classic rock and modern alternative all at the same time.\n\nCold Roses\n\nIt\u2019s rare in today\u2019s music to find a band that embodies the swagger of rock and roll, groove of Philly-soul, heartache of the blues and folk-esque storytelling quite like Cold Roses.\nAfter years as a guitarist in Philly bands, Rob Clancy decided to step out on his own as lead singer and songwriter, and form a group to play the music he\u2019d been envisioning for so long. A post to Craig\u2019s List ushered in Brandon Porter on bass, and the lineup became solidified with the addition of Alex Ayala on keys and R.M Webb on drums. The modest four piece would then expand to include a horn section, featuring Rick Rein on trumpet and Tom Petraccaro on saxophone.\nHoning their signature sound and electrifying audiences along the east coast for the past year and a half, Cold Roses self-released their debut LP \u201cNo Silence In The City\u201d on November 1st, 2014. Produced by Webb and Clancy, and recorded at Miner Street Recordings, the band implemented a more \u201ctraditional\u201d recording approach by performing each song live to analog tape, emulating the energy and intimacy of their live shows. The result is an 11 song \u201ctour de force\u201d album that showcases the band\u2019s versatility and \u201cdemonstrate[s] what it means to live and breathe the essence of rock and roll\u2026this is a dirty, soulful, wickedly fun album\u201d (ThatMag).
