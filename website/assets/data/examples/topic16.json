        "text":"Self-Publishing Platforms: Getting Your Book Into the Marketplace\n\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that self-publishing was viewed as a bit, shall we say, d\u00e9class\u00e9. Distribution was often facilitated by the trunk of the author's car, and word-of-mouth was the only form of publicity. Thanks to ebooks, the internet, and the availability of digital publishing platforms, however, things are changing. The stigma of self-publishing has diminished, and even previously trade-published authors are giving it a try.\n\nSome of the biggest publishers in the world are also getting into the self-publishing game, either with their own startups or by buying existing companies. In July 2012, Pearson, PLC bought Author Solutions for $116 million. Self-publishing is now big business.\n\nThere are numerous places to sell your ebook online-and almost as many platforms. You'll need to reformat your ebook for almost every different website. For those authors who don't have the knowledge or the time, the process of setting up all the different ebook formats and uploading to the various websites can appear daunting. But not to worry, there are companies out there who can do all that work for you, plus upload directly to the various outlets, and in some cases, sell your ebook.\n\nFounded in 2002, Lulu Enterprises, Inc. was one of the first online self-publishing companies. It now sells a variety of services, but it's still possible to publish on its site for free. The company takes a 20% royalty on books sold, and the author sets the price.\n\nKobo, Inc.'s recently released DIY portal, Writing Life, allows you to publish and sell through its site for free. (Full-service publishing and other services will cost you.) Kobo will format and sell your ebook through its site and e-readers, but it will also give you your ebook in formats that other sites use. Mark Lefebvre, director of self-publishing and author relations at Kobo, explained that while the company hopes its authors will stick around when they see how much Kobo has to offer, it understands why writers want their work available on multiple platforms. Kobo has created some unique features available on its own platform such as the Author Notes Program, which can allow for a dialogue between readers and the author on the ebook pages themselves. And in Canada, Kobo e-reading devices are outselling Kindles almost two-to-one.\n\nBookBaby, an offshoot of CD Baby, doesn't sell your ebook; it just does all the formatting work for you-for Kindle, NOOK, iPad, Sony, and even Kobo, with packages starting at $99. It will keep track of your accounting from all the different sites and offer payments on a weekly schedule. (You certainly won't get weekly royalties or even statements with a trade publishing house.)\n\nThe aforementioned Author Solutions, which calls itself the \"the leading indie publishing company in the world,\" offers both print and ebook services to authors-including formatting along with other options, such as cover and interior design, publicity and marketing, website creation, and according to the website, even \"television and infomercial advertising.\" In the past, Author Solutions has helped start self-publishing imprints for several large trade publishers, including Harlequin Enterprises Ltd. and Thomas Nelson, Inc. In 2009, Author Solutions purchased Xlibris Corp., another self-publishing company, which had previously been partially owned by Random House, Inc.\n\nWith more and more services being offered by more and more companies, options are growing for authors who choose to self-publish. However, is the line between self-publishing and vanity publishing becoming blurred? If you're spending far more than the book will ever earn, is it worth it? The \"rah-rah, self-publishing is better than trade publishing, away with the gatekeepers\" cry can sometimes smack of sour grapes. Choosing to go it alone only because you're afraid you don't have a shot in commercial publishing or because you don't want anyone editing or even changing a single word does a disservice to your book. I worry that there are books, particularly novels, which might have a chance with agents and publishers, but that will never live up to their true potential and are now getting lost in the sea of self-published material.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind why you're self-publishing. The majority of self-published ebook authors do not make much money. In May, The Guardian reported that half of self-published authors made less than $500 on their books in 2011. But that may be enough for authors who've struck out with the traditional route.",

        "text":"Advice for aspiring\u00a0authors\n\nOur greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.\n\n\u2015 Thomas A. Edison\n\nHave you ever considered giving up?\u00a0 Good news, you are not alone.\n\nI\u2019m going to give you a few example of others who almost pitched in the towel and left the writing to others. .\u00a0 . almost. Thank goodness they didn\u2019t give up.\n\nMost recent, during an interview with Writers Digest,\u00a0author Joe Hill (The Heart Shaped Box, Horns, NOS4A2, and the short story collection 20th Century Ghosts) talked about his journey toward publication.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t tell his agent who he was because he wanted his writing to stand on its own merit. In other words, he didn\u2019t want anyone to publish his novel because he was Stephen King\u2019s son.\n\nThe list is long and varied.\u00a0 Mystery author Agatha Christie collected 500 rejections in four short years.\n\nThe quality of the message associated with rejection is also often disheartening and horrific.\u00a0 Her\u2019s a paraphrase of a rejection received by author Zane Grey, \u201cyou have no business being a writer and should give up\u201d.\n\nSometimes the ability to choose the correct or enthusiastic publisher or agent eludes us, but the person who believes in our work as much as we do is out there.\n\nThe authors of \u201cChicken Soup for the Soul\u201d were informed that anthologies don\u2019t sell.\u00a0 Can you believe that?\u00a0 Thank goodness they didn\u2019t.\n\nC.S.Lewis collected 800 rejections for \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d, and\u00a0 Margaret Mitchell received 38 rejections for \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d.\n\nAuthor Paul Coelho sees a limited 800 copies of \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d sell, but with a new publisher, the number climbs to 75 million in print.\n\nFourteen agencies reject Stephanie Meyers \u201cTwilight\u201d which went on to spend 91 weeks on the NYT.\n\nL. Frank Baum, told his works was \u201ctoo radical a departure from juvenile literature\u201d, finally sells \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of\u00a0 OZ\u201d.\n\nLouisa May Alcott was told by a publisher, \u201cyou should stick to teaching\u201d which, thankfully she did not, and is still in print 140 years later.\n\nEven the esteemed Beatrix Potter, the beloved author of \u201cTales of Peter Rabbit\u201d was rejected so often she chose to self publish.\u00a0 From its original 250 copies to 45 million.\n\nThe Christopher Little Literary Agency collects twelve rejections for author J.K.Rowlings\u2019\u00a0 \u201cHarry Potter and the Philosophers Stone\u201d, until the eight year old daughter of a Bloomsbury editor insists on being allowed to finish reading the manuscript.\u00a0 This led the way for this series of books which now has 450 million books in print.\n\nThe message here is clear.\u00a0 Rejection is a part of the writing life.\u00a0 We all experience it in different ways, at different levels, and with or without rancor.\u00a0 But persistence is the key to success.\u00a0 The willingness and the ability to come back and try just one more time can be the difference between life an author, and life wishing you\u2019d finished the last book.\n\n\nBuilding Character\n\nCharacter cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.\n\nHelen Keller\n\nIn fiction, much like real life, character is built by one\u2019s life experience.\u00a0 The ability to engage with a character without showing their life story\u00a0 right up front is a basic skill ever writer learns. Sometimes the hard way.\n\nShort stories differ from novels and novellas in that\u00a0 the time to establish character is less in a short story and therefore, a different type of telling is used, usually dialogue exchange.\u00a0 Characters can tell you a lot about their fellow travelers on the fictional journey and should be used accordingly.\n\nBut in the longer piece of fiction, characters are built, and many aspects must be addressed.\u00a0 Such as, physical description.\u00a0 What does your character look like and how will you let the readers know?\n\nWhat does your character sound like?\u00a0 Is the voice strong?\u00a0 Commanding?\u00a0 Authoritative? Or is the voice meek, mild, submissive, or even absent?\n\nIs the character a person with a gentle touch, or more like a\u201d bull in a china shop\u201d? Is the behavior which determines their presence intentional or accidental?\u00a0 Are they aggressive or just clumsy?\n\nFor the more intimate moments, the writer should let us know how others respond to the characters we build.\u00a0 Reaction, though limited and more focused, is often poorly interpreted.\u00a0 This is a significant problem with single or first person point of view.\u00a0 Your narrator is often reactive to the behavior of other characters and can easily misinterpret the behavior or intentions of others.\n\nDuring the intimate physical exchange or even during the \u201cdance of attraction\u201d don\u2019t forget to let us know how your hero and heroine stimulate each other, touch, sight, or smell.\n\nOlfactory response is the earliest indicator of recognition for us humans, and often invokes powerful memories which in turn stimulate neurological responses.\u00a0 Intimate and even unknown fears are sometimes triggered by the sense of smell.\u00a0 So if you\u2019re looking for an opportunity to motivate your character to one of those little \u201cturn around \u201d a deep-seated fear connected with a specific odor might serve.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the motivation comes from the history of the character you built,\u00a0 and that is the path through which the great story is achieved.\u00a0 You can only hope to thoroughly engage your reader with a spell binding character, well motivated, and easily identified\u00a0 with, before you can craft a story that won\u2019t be put aside.\n\nWho decides?\n\nNever allow a person to tell you no who doesn\u2019t have the power to say yes.\n\n\u2015 Eleanor Roosevelt\n\nSometimes we have difficulty with finding the correct audience for our writing.\u00a0 Beta readers are not easy to come by, and as introverts\u2013 generally speaking\u2013 we are not likely to approach strangers to solicit critiques of our writing.\u00a0 Certainly never for first or rough draft.\n\nBut sometimes, we elicit the overall negative response which incites others to tell us something just isn\u2019t working.\u00a0 If the reviews are mixed, let\u2019s say 50-50 division on when a turn in the writing is working, or when it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s up to the writer to decide.\n\nBut let\u2019s address the endless number of people who are quick to point out flaws, foibles, and faux pas in a genre they do not normally read, or are wholly unfamiliar with, even on a good day.\u00a0 Those people are not your friends.\u00a0 They are not seeking to help you.\u00a0 Let me say this again, not helpful.\n\nWhen you ask for help with a writing project, ask the appropriate person.\u00a0 Someone who knows the genre, by virtue of being a long-term avid reader.\u00a0 Or someone with a proven track record, preferably someone publishing\u2013 and publishing well, in the same genre. This is the type of author who can give you valuable advice about readers of the genre. This is they type of help you need, and you should always be specific about the type of reader you\u2019re looking for on a project.\n\nDo you want a line edit?\u00a0 Ask for help from someone who does line edits, or purchase the service.\n\nDo you want someone to read for content?\u00a0 Then ask some one who reads for pleasure, hopefully an avid reader, to just read and please tell me where and when you put the book down and why.\u00a0 If the baby was crying, they needed to put the book down.\u00a0 If it became slow or boring, you need to examine the portion of the manuscript in the next editing pass. These readers will also tell you \u201cI just didn\u2019t believe he\/she would do that, it didn\u2019t seem realistic.\u201d\u00a0 Now that is a motivation problem, and also is easily fixed.\n\nJust plain beta readers, those who are not aspiring authors, are sometimes they people who help you to correct the worst of the manuscript mistakes.\u00a0 They will tell you the important things, like \u201cNot believable\u201d, or ask the ever important question of \u201cHow could she?\u201d \u00a0 These readers also better with pin pointing POV problems that new and aspiring writers don\u2019t see.\n\nMost often when we ask for help, we get exactly what we ask for, but it is also unpleasant to know you\u2019ve made a mistake.\u00a0 The wrong thinking in having your mistakes pointed out is the inability to just fix what\u2019s wrong and move on.\u00a0 Fixing is learning, and we don\u2019t usually repeat the mistakes we correct.\u00a0 Sometimes, but not always.\n\nIn the end, only you can decide.\u00a0 Who will be your beta readers, those who can and do help you?\u00a0 Or those who just want you to know how much they know. You decide.\n\n\n\u201cWhere do you get your ideas?\u201d\n\nA question all too familiar to most writers, whether they are seasoned professional with a hard track record of novels multi-pubbed in many foreign languages or the aspiring writer\u00a0 who has just \u2014 mistakenly\u2013 shared their aspiration to a career of full-time writing.\n\nThis is a common question for two very good reasons; 1) people are genuinely interested in how your process works or, 2) the can\u2019t think of anything else intelligent to say to someone who makes their living as a writer.\u00a0 After all, full-time author isn\u2019t a real job, is it?\n\nHappily or sadly, dependent on which side of the argument you fall, people do make a living at nothing but the writing.\n\nSo back to the question, where do the good ideas come from?\n\nThey are all around us.\u00a0 The good ideas are in the people we know and those we don\u2019t know, the folks we\u2019ve grown up with and those we pass on the street.\u00a0 The good ideas are everywhere if you know how to mine them out of your everyday life.\n\nWhat will you do when faced with a life changing decision?\u00a0 What do you think the people you know really well\u2013 your nearest and dearest do, when faced with a life altering choice?\u00a0 Would they sacrifice one loved one for another?\u00a0 Would they sacrifice their own life for someone else?\u00a0 Or would they sacrifice another in order to live?\n\nThe choices we make on our best day as human beings is not usually the choice we offer our characters in a novel.\u00a0 Those choices are much more difficult.\u00a0 The things we know\u2013 or think we know about ourselves...

McManus (NetGalley)\nThe Rest of Us Just Live Here by Patrick Ness (Kindle Purchase)\nThe Falconer by Elizabeth May (Kindle Purchase)\nEarthrise by M.C.A.

        "text":"In Waiting for Godot, a tragicomedy in two Acts of the Apostless by Samuel Beckett, two characters unconsciously express the sombre emptiness in life by amusing agencies. At face value it is amusing and blithe, yet a 2nd glimpse at the concealed metaphoric and symbolic devices reveals a out garden blooming with calamity. The two genres complement one another, temper making calamity, calamity making temper. Indeed, it is this curious coupling that qualifies the drama both in kernel and as a wordplay: a tragicomedy. At a superficial glimpse, the drama seems full of un-humanlike action and harbours an asinine sense of temper. The intended message of the motive is ill-defined and many of the characters are left concealed in darkness amidst a huge skin color of idiom that is amusing at the surface. This intimations at the impression that a thin cover of obvious comedy is utilized to mask the ultimate calamity nowadays at bosom. This calamity is carried forth via a spatter of motives, such as clip, significance and being, and God. By researching this relationship, a cohesive apprehension of the amusing and tragic elements becomes possible, leting us to decode the functions they play in the drama. As such, will clarify that Waiting for Godot does incorporate more elements of calamity, and their significance and significance are far greater than any of this drama \u2018s comedic value.\n\nII. Analysis\n\nIn order to look into both the comedic and tragic elements, an apprehension of how they are used in concurrence is necessary. In other words, we must foremost understand what a tragicomedy entails. By definition, a tragicomedy is a dramatic work integrating both tragic and amusing elements.[ 1 ]However, this indication does little more than repeat what we already know. In actuality, the significance of a tragicomedy has morphed over clip. It was ab initio coin by Plautus, a Roman playwright in the second century B.C.E. as a drama in which Gods and work forces, Masterss and slaves reverse the functions traditionally assigned to them, Gods and heroes moving in amusing burlesque and slaves following tragic self-respect.[ 2 ]Then during the Renaissance, tragicomedy became a genre of drama that assorted tragic elements into play that was chiefly amusing.[ 3 ]With the coming of pragmatism subsequently in the nineteenth century, tragicomedy underwent yet another alteration. Whilst still blending the two elements, amusing interludes now highlighted the dry counterpoints built-in in a drama[ 4 ], doing the calamity seem even more annihilating. In this manner, it can be said tragicomedy is a more meaningful and serious being than traditional calamity. Last, modern tragicomedy is sometimes used synonymously with Absurdist play, which suggest that laughter is the lone response left to adult male when he is faced with the tragic emptiness and nonsense of being.[ 5 ]\n\nThe last two categorizations are the most relevant accounts and I believe them to be indistinguishable to Beckett \u2018s apprehension of tragicomedy when he labelled his drama as such during his interlingual rendition. Surely, there is amusing interlude such as the treatment that occurs between Vladimir and Estragon in Act II during Pozzo \u2018s calls for aid \u201c We should inquire him for the bone foremost. Then if he refuses we \u2018ll go forth him at that place \u201d ( p89 ) , which highlights the tragic province that Pozzo is in through their comically serious turn about whether or non to assist him and surely at that place excessively is an geographic expedition of the emptiness and nonsense of being, which is basically the implicit in subject of the full drama.\n\nA bleak and tragic tone permeates the ambiance at the beginning of the drama. The phase is empty aside from a bare tree and two ragged hobos, Estragon and Vladimir. The really start of the drama begins with the narrative, \u201c Estragon, sitting on a low hill, is seeking to take off his boot. He pulls at it with both custodies, puffing. He gives up, exhausted, remainders, attempts once more. As earlier. \u201d ( p2 ) . Immediately after, Estragon, who gives up yet once more, speaks the celebrated words \u201c Nothing to be done \u201d , arguably the specifying manner of the full drama. The environing fortunes of the characters emanate an foreign disjunction to the universe and leave the audience utterly perplexed and bewildered by the apparently nonexistent motivation of the characters. The tragic elements are seen in the fortunes of the characters, their physical disablements, their lost sense of clip and extreme futility, their doomed being where aa\u201a\u00acA\u201cNothing happens and nil can be done, aa\u201a\u00acA? and the empty phase while the amusing elements revolve around the games the characters invent, their interactions with each other, and the vaudevillian modus operandis.[ 6 ]\n\nVladimir and Estragon are portrayed as homeless tramps devoid of intent, as strongly supported by their palsy, \u201c Well, shall we travel? Yes, allow \u2018s travel. They do non travel. \u201d In much the same manner, other characters, such as Pozzo and Lucky, are characterized excessively as adrift braces, symbolized by their hearing loss and mutism in Act II \u201c \u2026 Pozzo is unsighted\u2026 \u201d ( p87 ) . From merely analyzing the characters, we can see that they, like all human existences, have the potency to go \u201c better \u201d characters with \u201c better \u201d common sense. Our definition of normal and expected human behavior may merely every bit good be non-applicable to the scene of the drama, therefore the use of \u201c better \u201d is questionable. Our expected definition of calamity may be a derivation of our ain experiences. When person falls into a state of affairs that, as a consequence of social conformation, causes us to develop certain emotions, we feel for their loss or bad luck. However, the context of \u201c Waiting for Godot \u201d places us in a kingdom so unwanted, because underneath the initial knowing comedy lies a dimension of calamity that we can non clearly relate to, specifying itself as delusional even to the point of going upseting. The inane duologue and personalities of the drama \u2018s topics sets a state of affairs so freakish that the bounds of analysis must be broadened to accept such thoughts of human behavior before it is possible to understand Beckett \u2018s message and embrace the thought that one can be so unresponsive to an seemingly endless delay. By capitalising on the fixed positions of the audience, their actions become an absurd comedy that contributes to the tragic tone of the full drama.\n\nThe unchanging \u201c Nothing to be done \u201d ( p2 ) reinforces weakness and arrant despair in stead of the supporters.[ 7 ]Their physical disablements are the tragic fortunes that baffles the audience and while doing us laugh, shows us the nonsense of their being, such as Vladimir \u2018s vesica jobs, hinted at when \u201c progressing with short, stiff paces, legs broad apart \u201d ( p2 ) , and Estragon \u2018s battles with his pess, disturbed remainder, and maltreatment by persons he has no memory of, passing the dark \u201c in a ditch \u201d and claims that \u201c \u2018they \u2018 round me \u201d , where \u2018they \u2018 is ne\u2019er identified Such duologue can be labelled every bit tragic as their ain distinguishable personalities and personal jobs lead to the original, chief point that comedy simply shrouds the calamity.\n\nAn first-class illustration of such a scenario can be seen on ( p85 ) when Vladimir and Estragon spontaneously break out into consentaneous, unprecedented statement and grade each other with abuses such as \u201c Pompous ape! \u201d and \u201c Meticulous Hog! \u201d After the raillery, \u201c They embrace. They separate. \u201d ( p86 ) . While at the surface this scene may be deemed comedic due to the self-generated effusion, if we bring ourselves to look past this, we see that it is tragic when they reconcile. The calamity exists in their relationship. They both agree that each would be better off entirely, as Estragon says \u201c You piss better when I \u2018m non at that place. \u201d ( p64 ) and Vladimir answers, \u201c I missed you\u2026 and at the same clip I was happy. \u201d ( p64 ) . Despite this, they continue to remain together, non cognizing why. Because of this, it can be said that it is tragic how Vladimir and Estragon have no control over themselves nor the external factors impacting them. What is even more tragic is the futility of their delay. The fact that Godot does non of all time arrive and that nil is achieved with the apparent passing of clip as symbolized on ( p62 ) by the statement that \u201c The tree has four or five foliages \u201d define the apparently nonsense of their \u201c end \u201d . This thought of everlastingly unproductive advancement proves to expose a tragic image in the heads of the audience.\n\nRight after this scene is another merely as tragic at bosom. Tarragon Begins by oppugning, \u201c What do we make now? \u201d ( p86 ) to which Vladimir responds \u201c We could make our exercisings \u201d ( p86 ) . This is followed by a series of overdone actions and comically tyres Estragon out after a simple hop \u201c That \u2018s adequate, I \u2018m tired. \u201d ( p86 ) . This one time once more shows their inability to make what they want, an thought that is visited one time more at the terminal of the drama on ( p109 ) when Vladimir inquiries, \u201c Well? Shall we go? \u201d to which Estragon responds, \u201c Yes, allow \u2018s travel. \u201d but both do non travel. This inability to carry through such simple actions can be deemed tragic, and inquiries the intent of their being. \u201c We ever find something, eh Didi, to give us the feeling we exist? \u201d ( p77 ) . Note that Estragon uses the word feeling, connoting that they are cognizant of the nonsense and futility of their delay. Something must go on yet nil must go on when waiting and Beckett skillfully achieves this balance. It is non merely the general act of waiting that is tragic, but besides the things Estragon and Vladimir do during their delay that is tragic. True to the kernel of the drama, many of the amusing actions are paired with calamity. The two abuse each other and so accommodate. \u201c Vermin! Abortion! \u2026 ... (truncated)",

        "text":"Tom\u00e1\u0161 Zme\u0161kal\n\nTomas Zmeskal\n\n\n\u2014 Translated from the Czech by Nathan Fields\n\nRight at this moment Doctor Lukavsky didn\u2019t have time for a patient; he filled out the form and took him to the ward, and that was all for the moment. The patient the police had brought in, the confectioner Marek Svoboda, who called everyone, not only the doctor, but also the others, the patients as well as the caregivers, \u201cbrother\u201d or \u201csister\u201d, seemed calm and behaved in a balanced way. It was not yet necessary to make a certain diagnosis; the doctor had time for that. The person introducing himself as Jesus Socrates Amenhotep Hitler, and given the name Marek Svoboda by his parents, was at the right address here, the doctor judged. In the afternoon he had Mr. Svoboda called and he asked him if he would explain his name. The confectioner Svoboda looked attentively at the doctor and said:\n\n\u201cI am not sure, brother doctor, if you would understand my explanation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d the doctor interrupted, \u201cI would like to ask that you address me completely normally and plainly as Doctor Lukavsky.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut brother doctor, does it not please you that we, here, under the sun, are all equal?\u201d the confectioner asked.\n\n\u201cPlease, Mr. Svoboda, I ask you,\u201d the doctor said. Mr. Svoboda was silent and the doctor tried once again. \u201cCould you please tell me why you changed your name, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, brother doctor, I could,\u201d the confectioner said, \u201cbut first I ask you to please open the window and give a brother a bit of air; it would be brotherly love from you.\u201d The doctor made a note, unconnected to Svoboda, in his open file, set his pen on the table, stood, and cracked the window. The sound of wind in the spread branches of the deciduous trees which surrounded the main paths of the hospital areal began to enter the room. The confectioner stood, walked over to the partially-opened window and looked outside through the bars.\n\n\u201cHow far is it from here to the capital, brother doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean to Prague?\u201d the doctor asked.\n\n\u201cYes, brother, that\u2019s exactly what I mean,\u201d said the confectioner.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout two and a half hours by car,\u201d answered Doctor Lukavsky.\n\n\u201cYou see, brother, two and a half hours by car, that is a great distance, and we people are even more distant from each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you mean that, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d The doctor asked.\n\n\u201cDear brother, I knew that you were not going to understand me,\u201d said the confectioner.\n\n\u201cBy that do you mean the distance within human relationships?\u201d\n\n\u201cI stuck it in and now I\u2019m hauling it back out,\u201d the confectioner answered.\n\n\u201cMr. Svoboda, what is going on with your wife?\u201d the doctor asked.\n\n\u201cDear brother doctor, my sister wife left me, leaving only a goodbye letter behind.\u201d\n\nWhy did she leave you, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe found a noble lover, brother doctor,\u201d answered the confectioner.\n\n\u201cDo you have the letter, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cDear brother doctor, I ate it,\u201d the confectioner answered.\n\n\u201cOh, like that,\u201d said the doctor.\n\n\u201cOh, like that,\u201d the confectioner repeated after him, \u201cshe\u2019s already got herself free of the line and is sailing away?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the doctor asked, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that I understand you?\u201d the doctor said.\n\n\u201cBut brother doctor, brother doctor, I must chasten you, for I hear a fraction of impatience in your voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right, Mr. Svoboda, I am impatient, I have a long shift ahead of me and I would like to find out something from you.\u201d The confectioner remained standing at the barred window and ran the palms of his hands over his face, as if he were washing it of dust, and he returned to the table, where he sat himself once again in the chair across from the doctor.\n\n\u201cWhy are you called Jesus Socrates, Amenhotep Hitler, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had visions, brother\u2026, I had visions.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, brother, visions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf which kind?\u2019\n\n\u201cOf the pleading kind, brother, pleading\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not sure that I understand, Mr. Svoboda. Please, could you help me a little?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am doing what I can, brother doctor, as much as my strength, as much as my strength\u2026allows.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did this vision concern, brother\u2026, that is, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cFeel free to call me brother, dear brother doctor\u2026,\u201d the confectioner said with pleasure. \u201cAfter all, you know that under the sun, the moon and all the various comets all of us are equal\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course we are all equal,\u201d the doctor said and smiled, \u201cit\u2019s even in the constitution.\u201d He added after a moment.\n\n\u201cAnd how inappropriate, brother doctor, how inappropriate,\u201d the confectioner said.\n\n\u201cWhat is inappropriate, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d the doctor asked.\n\n\u201cInappropriate is inappropriate, that is inappropriate. Being ironic, sarcastic, and quoting a scrap of paper instead of looking into the human soul, brother.\u201d\n\u201cOh, like that,\u201d the doctor said, \u201clike that,\u201d he repeated, \u201cI am sorry if I offended you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Doctor, there is a long road awaiting you, a long road\u2026we can only offend ourselves after all, not a second person, a third, nor a fifth, nor seventh, not eleventh, nor a thirteenth, or a seventeenth\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. Svoboda, how were these visions of yours? The doctor asked, now rather more emphatic. The confectioner clasped his hands in front of his face, as if he were about to pray, and said:\n\n\u201cEvery name that I have was revealed to me in one vision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if you told me something about your last name, about the name Hitler, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Doctor, that was a harsh vision, harsh and long\u2026 and mainly, mainly harsh\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have time, Mr. Svoboda, we have time, today I have even the nightshift\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have the nightshift, brother, and meanwhile you are neither under the stars nor even under the sky, how sad, brother, how sad. How decrepit and sad your life is\u2026, do you realize it at all, brother?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d the doctor said and coughed, \u201csure, but so what about telling me something of this vision of yours, Mr. Svoboda? Do you think that you could?\u201d The confectioner was clearly thinking; he straightened out his fingers several times and said:\n\n\u201cEven wild animals are kinder to each other than people, remember that, and I unfortunately am no different, and so I at least try to be kind to myself.\u201d He was silent for a moment and then he added: \u201cI will tell you my vision, but only on one condition, brother doctor, only on one condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t promise you anything,\u201d the doctor said carefully and unsurely. \u201cWhat kind of condition is it, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe condition is absolutely, well, well\u2026, actually absolute,\u201d the confectioner said. \u201cEither you fulfill it, or you find out nothing, brother doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know, Mr. Svoboda, I think that you are not able to set conditions; after all, I am not giving you any conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre bars conditions, dear brother?\u201d the confectioner asked.\n\n\u201cBut Mr. Svoboda\u2026you must know\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a condition\u2026absolute and not up for discussion,\u201d the confectioner interrupted him. \u201cIf you want to hear the vision, that is, the picture of my truth, the universe be damned, which is the same as praise, you cannot interrupt me, otherwise you will simply not find out. Which will neither benefit, nor harm the universe. But do not try to bargain with me! I hope I deserve that much meager respect, even from your white coat, which needs washing. I wouldn\u2019t even dare to roll dough in such, ew, ew, ew!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I have no intention of interrupting you, Mr. Svoboda,\u201d the doctor said a little surprised and realized that he was making an effort not to look at his coat. \u201cYou should have told me that right away,\u201d he added, touched.\n\n\u201cThis is only for listening, doctor, this is only for listening, brother,\u201d the confectioner said severely.\n\n\u201cGo ahead, Mr. Svoboda; begin, surely I will not interrupt you, why would I interrupt you when it interests me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise?\u201d asked the confectioner.\n\n\u201cBut of course,\u201d the doctor answered.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t interrupt me even once?\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise,\u201d the doctor said.\n\n\u201cWell then, listen, brother doctor,\u201d the confectioner said, folding his hands in front of his face, like he wanted to pray.\n\n\u201cI was sleeping. I was sleeping completely calmly and comfortably, my wife had just had her birthday. We celebrated it as she wanted, only with a few friends. Afterwards, in the evening, we made love and fell asleep in each other\u2019s embrace. When I woke up, my head hurt, I thought that I would be sick. I rose from the bed, but just then another onslaught of the pain struck me again. It was most probably what they call a migraine. I completely collapsed as the pain passed through my head, and I slammed the shin of my right leg against the nightstand which stood next to the bed. I heard my wife\u2019s sleepy voice say: \u201cSweetie, again?\u201d I couldn\u2019t even see for the pain in my head. Before my eyes I had constellations and galaxies full of painful and cutting reflections. Someone was gently grasping my hand and speaking to me. It was the same voice which had addressed me before, but now the voice was whispering. Then two arms embraced me around the waist and gently set me back on the bed which I had just left. Someone put a glass in my hand. I understood that I was supposed to drink, and so I drank it. It tasted like mango juice. I drank it up and felt a bit strange that it tasted like mango, which I like, but which I had never yet tasted before. The hands which had set me on the bed lifted my leg, the one I had bumped, laid it on the bed and began washing the wound. After a moment I felt those hands tightening a bandage around my shin. \u201cStretch out, my love,\u201d the voice said to me again, \u201cit will pass in a moment.\u201d\n\nI got up, however, and said that I couldn\u2019t, that I had to go to the toilet, that I had to urinate. Those two arms raised me up a bit once again, and I already understood that I was supposed to stand, and blindly, because I still could not open my eyes, I followed them. I entered the room; I felt my way around it and sat myself on the toilet bowl from memory. I urinated and remained sitting on the toilet. I realized that the pain had begun to recede. I sat and eventually a... (truncated)",

A little pit pony named Bobbit is the catalyst bringing the two young people a chance to lead new lives filled with promise, despite heavy odds they must both overcome. Prepare yourself for the cruelty and hopelessness for both man and beast accompanying work in coal mines. Brace yourself to meet a vibrant active young woman who suddenly becomes a paraplegic. Find out how a small pony from the mines can help two struggling young people regain the balance that must exist for them to carry on.\n\nAuthor : Sally Sutherland\n\nA lifelong animal enthusiast, Sally Sutherland's interests have often centered upon reading and writing about horses. And as a child, she used to study and draw them endlessly. Sally has bred, trained, and shown horses in several disciplines, including driving, which is now her favorite. She has written driving articles for the Virginia Horse Journal. A health teacher for 27 years gave Sally insight into diseases like polio, or infantile paralysis, that swept parts of America during the late l940s and 1950s. Polio was of special interest to Sally as she has a cousin, who, as a young girl, was afflicted by the disease. After reading about how brutal life was for coal miners and the pit ponies working underground most of their lives, pulling heavy carts of coal out of the mines. Sally combined the two and came up with an idea to show how people must strive to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds in their lives?and the story of A Pit Pony Named Bobbit was born.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nWeight 0.62 lbs\n\n\nThere are no reviews yet.\n\nBe the first to review \u201cA Pit Pony Named Bobbit\u201d\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Book Buys, Word of Mouth and International Girls\u2019\u00a0Day\n\nRestless seeking to find stability, worthless seeking to fill sense of self, call it evasion, elopement or ostrich flight syndrome\u2026 the book buying spree is ongoing. But all of\u00a0the books I bought below come from personal recommendations, mainly via social media.\n\nA trio of blue\nA trio of blue\n\nAfter\u00a0posting a review\u00a0about Amy Liptrot\u2019s The Outrun, dear blogger friend Susan Osborne recommended Kathleen Jamie\u2019s nature essays, while Dorothy Nimmo and Steve Erickson were mentioned with some admiration on Twitter. Dorothy Nimmo apparently spent the 1960s as a \u2018trailing spouse\u2019 in Geneva, and her intriguingly succinct bio\u00a0 says: \u2018DN was an actress for ten years, a wife-and-mother for 25. In 1980 she started to write; in 1989 she ran away from home.\u2019\n\nMonochrome happiness\nMonochrome happiness\n\nMy Canadian friend and\u00a0fellow book fanatic\u00a0Sylvie \u00a0sent me the small volume Lire la rue, marcher le po\u00e8me (Read the street, walk the poem), a series of short essays and \u2018provocations\u2019, workshop notes\u00a0and samples of written\u00a0work\u00a0to inspire teachers to use poetry in the classroom. Meanwhile, the indefatigable Daniela Petracco of Europa Editions has sent me the proof copy of Saleem Haddad\u2019s moving novel about growing up queer in an Arab country.\n\nNot a girl in sight in the title, but there may be one in the text...\nNot a girl in sight in the title, but there may be one in the text\u2026\n\nThis one has a more complicated lead-in. When Sarah Savitt (then working at Faber) visited the Geneva Writers\u2019 Group in 2015 and gave me some feedback on my WIP, she was very excited about a book which she was about to launch, Kate Hamer\u2019s The Girl in the Red Coat. I was initially somewhat sceptical, having overdosed on books with \u2018girls\u2019 in their title, but when I read it, I thought there was a very different and unique voice at work there. Nearly two years later, my novel is nowhere near completion (sorry, Sarah!), but Kate Hamer has written a second one, which will be released in February 2017. When Sophie Portas from Faber asked who wanted an advance copy, I knew I had to request it, especially since it appears to once again feature a young girl\u2019s view on life.\n\nSpeaking of which,\u00a0today is the fifth International Day of the Girl, so here\u2019s to all the wonderful creatures and future generations of women out there! May your way be much smoother than the previous generations\u2019. Here\u2019s a poem by Phoebe Stuckes written just for you.\n\nLet us build bonfires of those unanswered prayers.\nLet us learn how to leave with clean and empty hearts\nLet us escape these attics still mad, still drunk, still raving\nLet us vacate these badly lit odd little towns\nLet us want none of what anchored our mothers\nLet us never evolve to be good or beautiful\nLet us spit and snarl and rattle the hatches\nLet us never be conquered\nLet us no longer keep keys in our knuckles\nLet us run into the streets hungry, fervent, ablaze.\n\nAre a mighty thing\nA captive animal, woken with a taste for blood.\nFeed it,\n\nYou Amazon, you Gloria, you Swiss army knife of a woman.\n\nInternational Day of the Girl banner from UNICEF, Haiti\nInternational Day of the Girl banner from UNICEF, Haiti\n\n\n\n\n17 thoughts on \u201cBook Buys, Word of Mouth and International Girls\u2019\u00a0Day\u201d\n\n  1. That\u2019s one thing I love about being a part of the online community, Marina Sofia. I learn about so many great books that are out there, or coming out. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found these. They do sound interesting (and tempting\u2026)\n\n  2. Sightlines is a book that I have too, tucked away on my shelf; and every time I find it I am surprised. I heard wonderful things about it and chanced to find it somewhere. I really ought to move it into a more prominent location!\n\n  3. Laughed at your possible reasons for book buying splurges especially the ostrich flight syndrome. I have visions now of you toddling off to the bookshop with feathers flapping madly amd that \u2018get out of my way\u2019 look.\n\n  4. That poem is perfect for this day Marina ~ Can\u2019t keep up with your book reviews & I marvel at your energy in reading and reviewing them ~\n\nLeave a Reply to susanosborne55 Cancel reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Jack Higgins \u2013 The Savage Day\n\n\u2018What they used to call Lags\u2019 Luck when I was in prison,\u2019 he said as he switched off the engine.\n\n\u2018Never mind that,\u2019 I said. \u2018Let\u2019s have that wheel off and the spare on and out of here double quick. I\u2019ve somehow got a feeling that it\u2019s healthier to stay on the move.\u2019\n\nBinnie handled the jack while I got the spare out of the boot. As I wheeled it round to him, a Land-Rover passed\n\nus going towards Plumbridge. It vanished into the mist, but a moment kter reappeared, reversing towards us.\n\nThe driver got out and came round to join us. He was no more than eighteen or nineteen. A lance-corporal in the Royal Corps of Transport.\n\nHe saluted smartly. \u2018Anything I can do, sir?\u2019\n\nHis attitude was natural enough at the sight of a Major getting his hands dirty. I made the first mistake by trying to get rid of him. \u2018No, everything\u2019s under control, Corporal, off you go.\u2019\n\nThere was a flicker of surprise in his eyes. He hesitated, then leaned down to Binnie who reacted violently. \u2018You heard what he said, didn\u2019t you ? Clear off.\u2019\n\nIt was an understandable reaction to stress, but delivered as it was in that fine Kerry accent of his, it compounded my original error.\n\nThe corporal hesitated, seemed about to speak, then thought better of it. He saluted punctiliously, then moved back to the Land-Rover. He started to get inside, or so it seemed, then turned and I saw that he was holding a Sterling.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d like to see your identity card if you don\u2019t mind, sir,\u2019 he said firmly.\n\n\u2018Now look here\/ I said.\n\nBinnie straightened slowly and the lad, who knew his business, I\u2019ll say that for him, said, \u2018Hands on top of the car.\u2019\n\nCork walked straight towards him, a puzzled smile on his face. Tor heaven\u2019s sake, young man\/ he said, \u2018control yourself. You\u2019re making a terrible mistake.\u2019\n\n\u2018Stand back,\u2019 the young corporal said. \u2018I warn you.\u2019\n\nBut he had hesitated for that one fatal second that seemed to give Cork his opportunity. He flung himself forward, clutching at the Sterling. There was the briefest of struggles. I had already taken a couple of strides to join\n\nhim when there was a single shot. Cork staggered back with a terrible cry and fell on his back.\n\nI put a fist into the corporal\u2019s stomach and a knee in his face as he doubled over that laid him unconscious at the side of the Land-Rover and was better than a bullet in the head from Binnie.\n\nHe was already on his knees beside Cork, who was obviously in great pain and barely conscious, blood on his lips. I ripped open the front of his cassock and looked inside. It was enough.\n\n\u2018Is it bad ?\u2019 Binnie demanded.\n\n\u2018Not good. From the looks of it, I\u2019d say he\u2019s been shot through the lungs. He needs a doctor badly. Where\u2019s the nearest hospital ? Stramore ?\u2019\n\n\u2018And life imprisonment if he pulls through ?\u2019 Binnie said.\n\n\u2018Have you got a better idea ?\u2019\n\n\u2018We could try to get him over the border into the Republic.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Even if we could pull it off, it\u2019s too far. There isn\u2019t time. He needs skilled treatment as soon as possible.\u2019\n\n\u2018Twelve miles,\u2019 he said, clutching my flak jacket. \u2018That\u2019s all, and I know a farm track south of Clady that runs clear into the Republic. There\u2019s a hospital no more than three miles on the other side run by the Little Sisters of Pity. They\u2019ll take him in.\u2019\n\nOne thing was certain. Another vehicle might appear from the mist at any moment so whatever we were going to do had to be done fast \u2018Right, get him into the Land-Rover,\u2019 I said.\n\nWe lifted him in between us, putting him out of sight behind the rear seat, then I got out again, knelt beside the unconscious corporal and tied his hands behind his back with his belt.\n\nBinnie joined me as I finished. \u2018What are we going to do with him?\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019ll have to take him with us. Can\u2019t afford to have anybody find him too soon.\u2019\n\nBinnie\u2019s anger boiled over suddenly and he kicked the unconscious man in the side. \u2018If he got his deserts, I\u2019d put a bullet in him.\u2019\n\nPage: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81\n\nCategories: Higgins, Jack",
