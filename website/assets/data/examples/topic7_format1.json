        "text":"Character Matters Sooner Than\u00a0Later\n\nTeenagers\u00a0may think that the middle and high school years don\u2019t matter much, and that having fun is paramount. Or they might think that making good grades, making the team, or being popular is what matters most. Those are common viewpoints held by teens and by the culture at large.\n\nEverybody has their value system, but here is a different way of looking at the teen years. We\u2019ve all heard that the teens are building character, one mistake and life lesson at a time. Let me put it a different way:\u00a0Teens are building a reputation right now, and that reputation will follow them, unfair as that may be.\n\nIf I could speak to every 7th grader in the world, I would say something like this:\n\n\u201cKids, listen up.\u00a0Who you are right now in school does matter, and here\u2019s why. Who are you are now is how others will remember you 20, 30, even 60 years from now. It\u2019s a snapshot etched in their memory. It may not be fair, but it\u2019s a fact. People will remember what kind of person you were, and it\u2019s that lens that they will see you through, until you are able to replace that lens, which takes a lot of time. Continue reading \u201cCharacter Matters Sooner Than\u00a0Later\u201d\n\nThe Social Combat of Being\u00a013\n\nA New World Order for Young Teens\n\ntired stressed girl7th and 8th grade is when the social life of a child amps up in three ways: importance, intensity, and consequences.\n\nAt 13, a child\u2019s social standing becomes extremely important to them, as it has become more important to all the other 13 year olds. For some, it is the most important aspect of life itself. Most teens would rather go without food and shelter than suffer any sort of social trouble.\n\nAt 13, a child\u2019s feelings of insecurity, awkwardness, and fear are at an all-time high. The hormones are raging, the insecurities are constant, and the emotional swings are intense. The biggest concern of every day is how to get through that whole day without any public embarrassment. Their fears are fueled by the intense anxieties of their peers. It\u2019s a sea of fears as far as the adolescent eye can see. Continue reading \u201cThe Social Combat of Being\u00a013\u201d\n\nYour Family. Your\u00a0Culture.\n\nThe most common theme among parents of young teens lately is that they want to live differently than the culture. Most parents do not want their kids to ingest the current culture of materialism, comparison, busyness, and anxiety. They don\u2019t like what the culture is teaching and demanding.\n\nMost parents want to be connected with their community, but they don\u2019t want to live just like everyone else (too busy and too anxious). And they certainly don\u2019t want the values of the pop culture to become the values of their children. On the other hand, they don\u2019t want their kids to be social freaks, always on the outside looking in. It\u2019s an everyday dilemma.\n\nWithout a doubt, it is difficult to grow up well when immersed in today\u2019s youth culture, which is filled with empty entertainment, rampant consumerism, unhealthy body imagery, and every type of narcissism. It consumes them and then uses them as consumers.\n\nIt is so rare to get wisdom from youth pop culture today that it actually makes the news. Recently, Robert Downey Jr., the actor who plays Ironman in the Avenger movie series, said at the MTV Movie Awards\u201cI advise you to dream big, work hard, keep your noses clean, be of service, and because you can, define your generation.\u201d This was a shocking statement because it is so countercultural in the Hollywood \/ MTV world. The cultural norm is the opposite: have fun, be sexy,\u00a0and take everything\u00a0you can from this life.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just youth pop culture that is toxic; it\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s in the cafeteria, on Instagram, in the classroom, and in other families\u2019 homes. The culture is teaching our kids to always look good, have all the right gadgets, and be the best at everything, in order to keep up with everybody else. It\u2019s a culture of discontentment, comparison, and competition that is making our kids more anxious and less happy than ever. It\u2019s never enough. It\u2019s an insatiable more.\n\nAs a concerned parent, the question is, \u201cHow do you create a family life that is what you want?\u201d\u00a0 Continue reading \u201cYour Family. Your\u00a0Culture.\u201d\n\nThe Power of\u00a0Kindness\n\nJosh was a normal teenager whose father died. His mother moved them from their home in the country to the city, with the hope that a fresh start would improve their lives.\n\nBut Josh was ridiculed in his new school for no good reason. In fact, he was ridiculed for a horrible reason.\n\nInstead of responding with hatred or melting into melancholy, Josh chose to be kind. To everyone. Simply kind. And his world changed.\n\nJosh\u2019s kind strength is what our boys and girls should imitate in their own ways.\n\nAdvice for Middle School\u00a0Kids\n\nRecently, I asked my Facebook friends to give me advice for my 7th graders. Here\u2019s what my friends have learned in their 30 years of growing up since 7th grade.\n\n  \u2022 Be cool to everyone because there\u2019s a good chance you will either marry, work with, or work for one of them one day.\n  \u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s not about the shoes, it\u2019s about what you can do in them.\u201d \u2013 Michael Jordan\n  \u2022 The stuff you are worried about is probably the wrong stuff.\n  \u2022 Everywhere you go, leave it better than you found it.\n  \u2022 Sometimes it\u2019s best to just take the butt whoopin\u2019 you deserve and move on.\n  \u2022 The prettiest girls are the ones you don\u2019t notice right away.\n  \u2022 The measure of success you hold now won\u2019t be the same in 20 years. Be good to everyone. Many who aren\u2019t \u201csuccessful\u201d now will be very successful in 20 years.\n  \u2022 If you want to know what you are like, look around at the people you hang with.\n  \u2022 You can pick you friends, you can pick your nose, but don\u2019t ever ever pick your friend\u2019s nose.\n  \u2022 The person who chooses not to read is no better off than the person who can\u2019t read.\n  \u2022 Manners matter! Always.\n  \u2022 How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.\n  \u2022 Some days you are the dog, and some days you are the fire hydrant. That\u2019s life.\n  \u2022 There is no such thing as normal\u2026it is only a setting on the dryer.\n  \u2022 Never miss a good chance to shut up.\n  \u2022 \u201c20 years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn\u2019t do than by the things you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Leave the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sail. Explore. Discover. Dream.\u201d ~ Mark Twain\n  \u2022 Those who hate you don\u2019t win, unless you hate them back.\n  \u2022 Sometimes you just have to accept that \u201cIt is what it is\u201d and sometimes you should fight it. Pray for the wisdom to know the difference.\n  \u2022 \u201cI\u2019ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\u201d \u2013 Maya Angelou\n\nChasing Health\n\nGoodHealthChoicesIf you are a parent of young children or teens, then you cannot afford to be unhealthy. Futures depend on your personal health. For many of us, it feels like chasing after the wind.\n\nMy wife and I are in our mid-forties, and our health is not even close to what it used to be, even though we live a relatively healthy lifestyle. We eat healthy. We exercise. We are not overweight and don\u2019t smoke. Sometimes it seems futile, but it\u2019s just mid-life. We can do the right things, and yet our bodies are just going to be breaking down from here on out.\n\nIn this second half of life, there are some things that just won\u2019t heal, that lifestyle won\u2019t fix. Neither my eyes nor my ears will be getting better, no matter how healthy I try to live. It\u2019s just decay. We get wrinkles, cysts, and gray hair.\n\nIn addition to the natural aging process, stress is slowly killing most 40-somethings. Continue reading \u201cChasing Health\u201d\n\nThe Distance Run\n\nCSC_0569I coach middle school cross country, which is not a glamorous job, but it is uniquely rewarding. For young distance runners, the hardest part is embracing the pain that creates stronger legs and faster times. I try to make practices and meets fun, but there is no way of getting around the fact that running really fast for 15-20 minutes is going to be painful, especially for growing little bodies.\n\nMost of the kids who run cross country learn that without a healthy dose of pain every day they will not improve. No pain, no gain. Convincing kids of this is no easy task, but over time the sport tends to naturally reward those who fight through physical pain and emotional weakness.\n\nWhen a young person develops some mental and physical toughness, they are growing up well. It\u2019s incredibly rewarding to see the progress that these kids make over a season.\n\nSome of my fellow coaches, Doug and Jennifer Meyer, use a fairy tale metaphor when explaining the need to persevere over a long distance. It also applies to many of life\u2019s challenges that require stamina.\n\nParenting is a distance run, after all.\n\nThe Wolf\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the race, there is a big bad wolf lurking around the corner. He will try to get you to slow down.\n\nHe sneaks up next to you and says things like, \u201cSlow down. You\u2019re hurting yourself. This is crazy. What\u2019s the point of this? It\u2019s not like you can win the race. You\u2019re not very fast. Doesn\u2019t this hurt? Just take it easy. No one will notice.\u201d\n\nThe wolf doesn\u2019t want you to work hard to achieve your goals. Continue reading \u201cThe Distance Run\u201d",
