A stalwart at home or an event sponsored by money bags, doesn\u2019t matter, yet records at the Olympics still fly high, even if it means the last laugh for the participant. Every nation occupies the stage to be noticed. The most heart-warming and heart-rending participation came from the contingent that represented the \u2018refugees\u2019 from Syria, Libya, Yemen, all war-ridden nations. All for a universal circus.

Her face still glistens, Never yearned for a better friend, but there, She still laughs & listens ( An obit written in 1989 for Jessy, revised a bit now) It is not with any regret or longing that I deplore my present network of being friendless.

No, I have not turned a recluse but when one had been showered with a lot of attention and care by one friend, she is missed now and always. Then one gets entwined gradually with one particular train of thought that, had Jessy been there, it would have been different. Unassuming smile lost. The tall, lean, thirty something\u00a0 Jessy kept hovering around me through thick and thin during those decisive years. She counselled , convinced and cajoled me to venture\/avoid all major decisions in life. Then one fine day she just paled into insignificance called \u2018death\u2019.
