(quick dinners)\n\nI just got back from my\u00a0latin dance class... and of course I had to come home immediately after and have tacos and beer! This is a quick dish you can cook up in less than twenty minutes.\n\nCilantro-Lime Tofu Tacos\n\nTaco filling:\n(1) I\u00a0used pre-cut supermarket veggies (onions and peppers), sauteed them in an 1 tbsp\u00a0of sesame oil (sesame oil doesn't change its molecular structure when heated to high temperatures, thus it stays safe for your heart!). Sautee for about 7 minutes or until the onions are translucent.\n(2) Add one 12oz package of firm cubed tofu into the pan, smash with a fork\n(3) Top with 8 oz of cilantro-lime salsa. I used Frontera brand, they're great. It's got roasted tomatillo & green pepper. This flavoring will give the tofu a more \"chickeny\" taste, there's also a great cumin & tomato variety that will give the tofu the \"ground beef\" flavor we all love in tacos!\n(4) Cook for 7 minutes, remove from heat.\n\nI also whipped up a quick guacamole with an avocado, 1\/2 white onion,\u00a01\/2 tsp garlic, pinch salt, pinch cracked black pepper, 1 tbsp lemon juice. Throw in the food processor and you're done.\n\nOther toppings:\nstore-bought fresh salsa\n1\/2 can of corn, seasoned with a bit of cracked pepper and lime juice\n\n2 low-carb whole wheat tortillas, burnt over the grill (you could just use your stove too!)\n\nPS. Bud and Bud-Light are vegan-friendly beers!\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

Using a fork, combine the goat cheese, pancetta, tomatoes, herbs, and garlic in a small bowl. Chill the mixture for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld. When ready to use it, let the cheese mixture soften slightly at room temperature.\n\n\n1 cup Zinfandel or full-flavored red wine\n\n1 medium shallot, finely minced\n\n2 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary, or a combination\n\n2 cups lamb stock (or substitute rich Chicken Stock [see book for recipe])\n\n2 tablespoons butter, cut in four pieces\n\nSalt and pepper\n\nPlace the wine, shallot, and herb in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the stock, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer until reduced to 1\/2 cup of liquid. Remove the herb sprigs.\n\nWhisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time. The sauce should be glossy and slightly syrupy (but not so thick that it sticks your lips together; add a tablespoon or two of hot water if it gets too thick). Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n\n1 1\/2 pounds boneless lamb loin, cut into 4 (6-ounce) portions\n\nSalt and pepper\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n\nGoat Cheese Filling\n\nZinfandel Sauce\n\nSeason the lamb with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Sear the lamb on both sides for a minute or so, to brown, and then reduce the heat and cook each side 3\u20134 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and let rest. You may serve the loins whole or sliced, with equal portions of the goat cheese mixture crumbled along the top and Zinfandel sauce spooned over it.\n\nPenelope Makes the Lamb\n\nHere's what to serve at your next (small) dinner party. I used store-bought organic chicken stock for the Zinfandel sauce, but otherwise hewed exactly to Spicer's instructions. The bang-per-buck ratio was enormous: The goat cheese dressing and silky, deep purple Zin sauce were gorgeous-looking and -tasting, and took so little time and brain power that I felt quite cheflike and preened for hours afterwards \u2014 causing much eye-rolling in my family. There's something about a sauce....\n\nWhat do you think?",

Fill with enough water to cover the chicken, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat; boil for 20 minutes. Reserve 4 cups of the resulting chicken stock in a large saucepan.\n  3. Remove the chicken and onion from the Dutch oven and place in a roasting pan. Season the chicken with the dried cilantro, black pepper, and salt; cover with aluminum foil.\n  4. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking until the chicken becomes golden brown.\n  5. Meanwhile, pour the rice in with the reserved chicken stock. Bring the rice to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. once it reaches a boil, cover the saucepan and reduce the heat to low, simmer covered for 15 minutes.

Served to company and they all liked it too. It does not say whether to include the cinnamon sticks and pods in the broth that you use to cook the rice. I did not but I will try doing do next time to see if it strengthens the flavors. Also, I advise using more than one onion. The onion was the best at soaking up the flavors. The perfect bite had some chicken, some onion and some rice - but there was not really enough onion. Definitely will make again. Nice subtle flavors. Distinct recipe option. Makes me want to try more Saudi Arabian foods.\n\nFeb 12, 2008\n\nI enjoyed this recipe because it was very easy to make and had a unique and subtle flavor. I also like that the rice is partially made with milk - it is a technique I will probably use in other dishes as well. In my area, it was difficult to find cardamom pods, so we used ground cardamom (3 tsp) instead. Not having a basis for comparison, I can't say if it turned out the same, but we thought it turned out very good. It was also an experience to try a Saudi dish as I had never had one before. I will certainly be recommending this recipe to others.\n\n\n4 Ratings\n\nJan 28, 2009\n\nFragrant and delicous. The milk makes the rice rich, but not heavy.\n\nOct 22, 2012\n\nThis was really easy and tasty. I used my slow cooker and then deboned the chicken and served on side. It probably would have been even better baked.\n\n\nRate This Recipe\n\nGlad you liked it!

        "text":"somesault festival\n\nCarrot and chickpea tagine with lemon\u00a0couscous\n\nPosted on Updated on\n\nCarrot and chickpea tagine with lemon couscous\n\nA dish served at Somersault festival from an outdoor Lia\u2019s Kitchen.\n\nMoroccan is one of those cuisines that combine sweetness, tanginess and aromas beautifully, transforming even the most basic of ingredients into deliciously opulent dishes.\n\nThis carrot and chickpea tagine is an ideal dish for outdoor cooking for the masses and can be executed easily in the most basic of outdoor kitchens, as we found out at Somersault festival at the end of July. The non-dairy ingredients not only make it light and healthy but also more suitable for camping and outdoor kitchens without refrigeration.\n\nWhat makes this dish, apart from the toasting of its aromatic spice mix, is the combination of ginger and onion which\u00a0are saut\u00e9ed at the first step of the dish. This pairing is not unique to Moroccan cuisine and I first came across it in Cambodia and then Kerala, where it seems to be the base for so many of the dry dishes that accompany family meals every day.\n\nThe accompanying lemon couscous is easy and quick to make. Its tanginess pairs well with the sweet spiciness of the tagine. In shortage of preserved lemons last month I used lemon and lime peel and much of their juice to flavour the couscous.\n\n\n(Feeds 4-5)\n\nFor Tagine\n\n1 onion\n\n4 garlic cloves\n\n1 T grated fresh ginger\n\n\u00be t ground cinnamon\n\n\u00bd t ground black pepper\n\n\u00bd t cayenne pepper\n\n\u00bc t ground cumin\n\n\u00bc t Ras-el-Hanout or couscous spice mixture\n\nA pinch of smoked paprika\n\nHandful of fresh coriander chopped\n\n5 carrots thickly chopped \u2013whole- (400g)\n\n5 cups precooked chickpeas, drained and washed\n\n2 T honey\n\nOlive oil for frying\n\nSalt for seasoning\n\n1 T lemon or lime juice (optional)\n\nFor Cous Cous\n\n4 T turmeric\n\nPeel of half a lemon\n\n2 T lemon juice and up to half a lemon\n\n3 garlic cloves (mashed or finely chopped)\n\n1.5 cup couscous\n\n\u00bc cup or a handful of chopped coriander\n\nSalt and pepper to season\n\n\n(One hour preparation and cooking time)\n\nFry the finely chopped onion and grated ginger (and a pinch of salt) in a little olive oil for a couple minutes.\n\nAdd the spices and fry for a bit more until translucent.\n\nAdd the garlic and fry for a minute or two at low heat -make sure it does not burn.\n\nAdd the carrots and stir fry until well coated with the spices.\n\nAdd the drained chickpeas and the lemon juice and a few pinches of salt.\n\nAdd a bit of warm water (just enough for the ingredients not to stick to the pan).\n\nAt the same time add the honey and some more olive oil.\n\nStir well, cover and simmer on low heat until the carrots are soft but still have a bite (usually twenty minutes).\n\nAt the end of the process add the fresh and finely chopped coriander and mix.\n\nWhilst the tagine is cooking boil one and a half cup of water.\n\nAdd some olive oil to a hot frying pan and fry the lemon peel and the turmeric.\n\nAdd the garlic and some salt and lightly fry but avoid burning.\n\nAdd the boiling water, season, mix and then stir in the couscous.\n\nTake off the heat and cover until the couscous rises and doubles in size.\n\nAdd the fresh coriander when the couscous is ready.\n\nTry and season to taste.\n\nLia\u2019s Tips:\n\nFor the tagine use a wide and deep frying pan, preferably twenty centimetres. This allows the liquid to evaporate more evenly and quicker speeding up your cooking time. It also means you don\u2019t need as much liquid to cook the carrots.\n\nAt the end of the cooking time there will be no sauce for this tagine but the dish should not be really dry. The honey and the added liquid should have formed a thin syrup that keeps the dish moist. If you run out of liquid as the carrots boil make sure you add enough to achieve this.\n\nThe dish is vegan but of course there is nothing stopping you from adding a couple of dollops of Greek-style yoghurt or some feta.\n\nYou can replace the fresh coriander with a tablespoon of dry coriander in the couscous if you would like.",

I was inspired to add the barely for fiber and substance, and the low-fat coconut milk is a tasty change. Super easy to make. The flavor is refreshing, too!\"\n\n+ Recipe Box + Shopping List + Menu Print\n\nIngredients Edit and Save\n\nOriginal recipe makes 6 servings Change Servings\n\n\n  1. Bring the barley and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the barley is tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.\n  2. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir the onion and celery into the melted butter, place a cover on the pot, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add about half the garlic. Season with the black pepper, red pepper flakes, sea salt, and nutmeg. Return the cover to the pot and cook another 5 minutes.\n  3. Stir the broccoli, vegetable stock, and remaining garlic into the mixture and bring to a boil. Return the cover to the pot, reduce heat to medium, and cook another 15 minutes, stirring once. Remove the pot from heat.\n  4. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold the blender lid with a folded kitchen towel and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can puree the soup with a stick blender directly in the pot.\n  5. Return the soup to medium-low heat. Stir the coconut milk, 2% milk, and barley into the pureed soup; cover and cook until hot, 5 to 8 minutes. Ladle into bowls and top with Asiago cheese and parsley to serve.\nKitchen-Friendly View\n  \u2022 PREP 25 mins\n  \u2022 COOK 1 hr\n  \u2022 READY IN 1 hr 25 mins\n\nReviews More Reviews\n\nMost Helpful Positive Review\nJul 12, 2010\n\nFABULOUS!! I really appreciated the previous reviews re the pepper. I'm one who follows recipes to the letter, and I likely would have added the amt of pepper called for, so my thanks to the previous reviewers for alerting me. I added the amt of pepper I would normally use in any recipe and the soup came out perfect. I LOVE this soup and it will definitely become a staple in my meal rotation. Great job!! Thank you so much!\n\nMost Helpful Critical Review\nJul 06, 2010\n\nToo much pepper by far! You can taste a brilliant soup hiding beneath a vicious layer of pepper here. I will make this again with a fraction of the pepper, but I used less than the prescribed amount and am kicking myself for not going with my instinct. Dangit!\n\nDec 07, 2010\n\nWay, way WAY too much pepper! I think this recipe would be delicious if we hadn't completely overdosed it with pepper. Two tablespoons means you can almost not taste anything else about it, unfortunately. We are going to try to make it again, this time with perhaps 1 or 1\/2 teaspoon pepper to start, since you can always add more if needed once it's been served. Definitely cut down on the pepper, did I mention that? : )\n\nAug 16, 2010\n\nThis should be renamed Pepper Soup! I cut down the amounts of both the black and red pepper, and it wasn't enough! I added carrots to make up for the broccoli that I didn't have, and left out the butter entirely. I'll try this again without any pepper!\n\nOct 21, 2011\n\nHubby says this is the best vegetarian soup he's ever had! I substituted buckwheat for the barley and earth balance margarine for the butter due to allergy concerns. Per other reviews, I used 2 teaspoons black pepper and 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes - that worked out perfectly. Didn't have celery or onion so I left those out and substituted 1 T. onion powder for the onion. Excellent soup! It would probably taste even better with the celery and onion. :) Oh, and I used full fat coconut milk and 3.25 cups water with 1\/4 t. red miso instead of the vegetable broth.\n\nSep 07, 2010\n\nI did not really care all that much for this soup. The flavour was rather not to my liking, and there was just something about it that did not sit well with me. I will not be making this again. It is edible, but nothing more. I am, however, glad I tried it- the idea is good.\n\nAug 02, 2010\n\nI just made this yummy soup and it is realy good. I didnt have coconut milk so i just some creamed coconut i had and it works just fine!\n\nJul 07, 2010\n\nThe pepper quantities are definitely typos: Should be TEASPOONS, not tablespoons. Yummy soup. I'd hoped for more coconut flavor, but I think we used extra-extra broccoli (it's fresh and bountiful), which masked the coconut flavor. Will make this again!\n\n\nRate This Recipe\n\nGlad you liked it!

Favorite the stuff you like.\n\nGot it!\n\nJenny is in perpetual search for easy, weeknight recipes to attempt to feed her family. When they balk, she just eats more.\n\nYogurt Pancakes with Pomegranate\n\n\nWhen I woke up one Saturday morning and realized I had six girls sleeping in my house and that there would be a need for pancakes, I made my way to the fridge in the manner I suppose a horse owner heads to the stables, knowing a brushing and a hoof cleaning is in order. It might seem a chore to others, but it\u2019s one of those things that are so part of the regular order of sleepover life that you don\u2019t really think about it anymore.\u00a0\n\nUntil you realize there is no milk. Now first, to paraphrase the airlines\u2019 line on oxygen masks, please adjust your coffee before assisting your child. That meant a cup borrowed from the neighbor \u2013 STAT! -- \u00a0but that was not enough of the stuff for pancakes.\u00a0\n\nNo worries, it was Yogurt Pancakes with Pomegranate to the rescue. I decided to feed people under the age of 12 only, surmising, correctly, that the older ones would still be asleep once I had made breakfast, nominally cleaned it up, gone for an extensive run and come home, panting.\u00a0\n\n\nThis meant the recipe simply had to be tripled, and in a Barbie \u201cMath Is Hard!\u201d moment I did have to spend a good three minutes thinking about how many egg whites I needed.\u00a0\n\nFrom there it was a breeze. You\u2019re working just a few minutes with a hand mixer and stirring egg yolks with the dry ingredients (an unusual method no?) and before you know it, you\u2019ve got breakfast all but ready in ten minutes.\u00a0\n\nThis batter is really unusual however and you need to work with it a bit to make it from pan to plate in one piece. All those whipped eggs make it sort of jingly jangly and hard to flip; you\u2019re best off making large sized pancakes that you can really get your spatula under and watching them carefully. \u00a0They are light and a tad sour but delightfully so and really take on syrup nicely.\u00a0\n\nNeedless to say a person who has no milk has no pomegranates, either.\u00a0\n\nYogurt Pancakes with Pomegranate by SmallKitchCara\n\nServes 1\n\n1 egg\n1 egg white\n1\/2 cup plain yogurt, low- or non-fat is fine\n3 tablespoons flour\n1\/4 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 teaspoon sugar\n1 pinch salt\n1 teaspoon butter\n1\/4 cup pomegranate seeds\nmaple syrup, warmed, for serving\n\nSee the full recipe (and save and print it) here.\n\n\nTags: jenny, jenny's in the kitchen, pancakes, breakfast, everyday cooking",

Get the saute pan or wok very hot.\n  2. Stir-fry the onions without the butter\/ghee for a few minutes, until they char just a little on the outside.\n  3. Add the spiced butter and the venison. Stir-fry hot and fast until the outside of the meat is brown but the inside of the meat is still very rare. You need to do this on as hot a burner as you have. Do it in two batches unless you have a very large wok or pan.\n  4. The moment the meat has browned, add it all back into the pan along with the spices, garlic and chiles. Stir-fry another 30 seconds\n  5. Add the tomatoes and the wine. Toss to combine and let this cook for a minute or two.\n  6. Serve at once with injera.\n\n\nThis is the last of the recipes I\u2019m copying from my spouse.\u00a0 As usual, I can\u2019t vouch for the original source or authenticity; however, I will say that most of the beef tibs I\u2019ve had in Ethiopian restaurants have been more slow-cooked than this is.\u00a0 If I find a good recipe for that style, I\u2019ll post it later.\n\nThe amount of chile pepper to add is up to you, so experiment with spice level.\n\n\nDoro Wat\n\nDoro Wat\n\nMakes: a lot\nTime: about an hour\n\n\n  \u2022 3 lb skinless dark meat chicken pieces\n  \u2022 8 oz butter\n  \u2022 3 lb onions (peeled and finely chopped)\n  \u2022 6 garlic cloves (chopped and mashed)\n  \u2022 3 Tbsp berbere\n  \u2022 9 oz tomato puree (diced tomatoes will work fine)\n  \u2022 2 tsp sugar\n  \u2022 2 tsp salt\n  \u2022 1\/2 tsp turmeric\n  \u2022 Some hard boiled eggs (peeled) (optional; I usually omit)\n\n\n  1. Make a few cuts in each chicken piece, to allow the sauce to penetrate the chicken flesh.\n  2. In a large pot, melt the butter and saute the chopped onions and garlic over medium heat, about 10 minutes.\n  3. Add the 3 tablespoons Berbere spice mixture, stir through, and then add the tomato puree, sugar and salt.\n  4. Simmer this over low heat for about 10 minutes.\n  5. Add the chicken pieces and stir well so each piece is covered with the sauce.\n  6. Add enough water to get a sauce consistency as for thick soup.\n  7. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n  8. If using, add the peeled, hard-boiled eggs (whole).\u00a0\n  9. Cover the pot, and let cook over low heat until chicken is tender. The oil tends to rise to the top when the dish is ready.\n  10. Traditionally, the dish will be cooled down somewhat before serving.\n\n\n  \u2022 Sik Sik Wat \u2013 substitute cubed stewing beef for chicken.\n  \u2022 Zucchini Wat \u2013 substitute zucchini halved and quartered, reduce time to cook only until zucchini is soft through.\n\n\nObligatory notice about lack of info about authenticity or source because my spouse collected this recipe.\n\nDoro wat is often spicy but adjust to your taste.\u00a0 My spouse defaults to chicken breast a lot, but this is fine with any part of the chicken.\u00a0 You can go boneless or bone in because at the end the meat should be easily pulled off the bone.\n\nThe standard recipe includes hard-boiled eggs, but I almost always leave them off because I don\u2019t like hard-boiled eggs.",

Weighing in at only 181 calories per person, this is the ultimate in tasty diet food.\n\nLarge mixing bowl\n\nSmall saucepan of boiling water for the eggs\n\nFine grater\n\n\nSmall bowl and a fork OR an empty jar for the dressing\n\n\n\nBefore you start, have all the ingredients out and prepared with a small saucepan of boiling water on the hob. Now click here!\n\n\nThis week, there are two original recipes on my newsletter which will make Christmas that little bit easier, and taste that much better! My Pork & Pickle Stuffing Balls and my Baileys Biscuits. The stuffing recipe is a great alternative to the traditional sage and onion - filled with pork, apple and chunky pickle, it has a real tang to it and is very easy and cheap to make. My very grown-up Baileys Biscuits have a good whack of alcohol and a delicious chewy, oat bite to them - naughtily moreish!\n\nThroughout December, the theme for my newsletters is, not surprisingly, 'Christmas'! I have 3 great recipes for you this month, from my Grand Marnier Souffl\u00e9 to Baileys Biscuits. So sign up for free today to get your recipes each week, along with valuable cooking tips for the festive season.\n\nSimply enter your email address - it won't go to 3rd parties and you won't receive any junk mail!\n\n\n\nBefore you start, have all theingredients out and prepared as noted in the ingredients section. Put a small saucepan of boiling water on the hob.\n\nCarefully put the eggs into the boiling water and set your timer for 5 minutes. Whilst the eggs are boiling you can make the dressing.\n\nUsing the finest side of a grater, grate the zest of a lime into a small mixing bowl or empty jar. To that, add in 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil, 1 teaspoon of clear runny honey, the chopped mint, the juice of half of the lime and a small pinch of salt. Whisk together or put the lid on your jar and give it a good shake.\n\nPeel a few long strips of carrot into the large bowl of lettuce leaves. Add the cucumber batons and give everything a light toss together.\n\nOnce the eggs have had 5 minutes, remove them from the hob and drain the boiling water away. Pour enough cold water into the pan to cover the eggs.\n\nGive the dressing another shake or whisk together and then pour it over the salad. Toss together lightly with your fingers so that the dressing coats the lettuce leaves.\n\nPlace a large handful of the salad onto your plate or bowls. Scatter half of the beetroot over each plate.\n\nShell the eggs (remember they're soft boiled so be extra careful!). To cut each egg in half without losing the soft yolk, hold the egg together whilst you carefully slice it in half using a small sharp knife. Hold the 2 egg halves together as you lift them on top of your salad.\n\nI hope that you enjoy it.\n\n\nAll content \u00a9 2012 - Privacy Policy",

I do not know if these are crayfish or crawfish, as they have no discernable claws - unless I only ever see the female versions?\n\nThey are a freshwater shellfish similar in many ways to prawns as regards cooking and size. They average 4 inches in length, but larger and smaller versions exist - probably related to when they are harvested.\nYou should always buy these fresh from large tanks in either supermarkets or wet markets, and refuse any that are already dead.\n\nThe ones pictured were bought in October 2010 and measured up to 5 inches long. I managed to take this picture just before my wife cooked them.\n\nWhen cooking, treat exactly like you would prawns of the same size. My wife usually boils them whole, or sometimes steams them in a wok with spacer. Cooking time is around 4 minutes when boiled.\nImage: Seurng Mor or Crayfish - Click to Enlarge\nI really do like shellfish, but I am not really taken with these things. They have very little flavour, and what there is tastes a bit 'grungey' for want of a better description.\n\nMy real problem however is finding any meat! What there is is underneath a hard body shell that is very difficult to break into, and whilst this does eventually peel away like a prawns, it is a lot of work. Once inside there is a ribbon of tasteless meat, and that's all. My wife chomps the heads off them and then chews the body. Whilst I don't now mind doing this with prawns, I really don't see the point of it all here.\n\nChinese Recipe 1\n\nThe normal way to cook these is to wash them under water and stir fry for several minutes, tossing fairly often. You can cook them in water or steam them, or put into hot oil. The oil could have either or both a clove of garlic and a little freshly diced ginger, but the taste is perhaps better without. Cook until they begin to turn pink and immediately remove from the heat, plate, and serve. A small condiment bowl of soy sauce is usually provided at table for dipping as you like.\n\nChinese Recipe 2\n\nI have seen these presented by shellfish restaurants in 'curls'. By this I mean the chef strips out the uncooked meat from the back and sets it aside to marinade. I have tasted this when marinated with Fish Oil Sauce (The stuff in bottles).\n\nTo a hot wok add a little: oil, garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for 1-minute before throwing in the meat and half-inch cubes of fresh tofu. Flash-fry for another minute. The meat should curl and turn pink in this time. Add a little water, some chicken bouillon powder, and several inches of tomatoe puree. Complete with fresh chopped coriander leaves and a pinch of salt and pepper.

        "text":"Mixed Antipasto\n\nPin It\n\nThe Holiday and entertaining season is here, so I wanted to share with you this appetizer\/first course. \u00a0It is perfect for those open house parties, elegant for a buffet and--well, we have been known to eat this for a meal with some crusty bread to sop up the sauce. \u00a0Meats, cheese, veggies...what's not too love? \u00a0The fennel and carrots are cooked just until tender and jarred roasted red bell peppers are used for ease. \u00a0The bocconcini (small buffalo mozzarella) is creamy, the artichokes briny and the herbs just bring it all together.\n\nIt is better if made in advance, so make it then go and get some holiday shopping done.\n\nI serve it with toothpicks for an appetizer and with small shallow bowls on the side for those who want to enjoy it as a first course. \u00a0\n\nNote: \u00a0I enjoy Columbus Soppressata and I use really good balsamic vinegar--it is like a sweet syrup. \u00a0It makes a difference, so buy yourself an early gift and enjoy it all year long. \u00a0Otherwise, I would suggest reducing a non-aged balsamic vinegar by half or until it becomes thick and syrupy.\n\nThis is perfect party food.\n\nMixed Antipasto\nserves 10-12\n\n2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n2 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n1 large clove garlic, finely minced or grated on a micro-plane\n1 teaspoon dried basil\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary\n1\/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1\/4 cup Extra Virgin olive oil\n3 large carrots, peeled and cut diagonally into 1\/4-inch thick slices\n2 fennel bulbs, tops trimmed and cut into 1\/4-inch slices\n2 jarred roasted red bell peppers, drained and cut in to 1\/2-inch strips\n1-lb bocconcini (small mozzarella balls), drained\n10 oz sopressata, sliced in to 1\/4-in thick slices and halved\n2 15-oz canned whole small artichokes, drained\n\ncrushed red pepper flakes to taste (optional)\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\nFor the marinade\nIn a small bowl whisk together the vinegars, garlic, basil, oregano, and rosemary and salt. \u00a0Whisking slowly add the oil and whisk until emulsified. \u00a0Set aside.\n\nFill a large saucepan full of water to a boil. \u00a0Blanch the carrots and fennel until they are tender but still crisp, about 4-5 minutes. \u00a0Drain and plunge in to a bowl of ice cold water to stop the cooking process. \u00a0Once cool, drain well\n\nIn a large bowl add the carrots, fennel, peppers, bocconcini, salami, artichokes, and the marinade. \u00a0Mix until combined and coated. \u00a0Season with crushed red pepper flakes, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. \u00a0Chill in a covered container for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. \u00a0Bring to room temperature for 30 minutes before serving. \u00a0Enjoy!\n\nSource: Adapted from Epicurious\n\n\n  1. this looks really great! I usually put out a charcuterie\/cheese platter when I entertain, but this is another great alternative!\n\n  2. Vittle me this-\n    Thank you:) Everyone raves when I serve it. I hope you give it a try. Thanks for stopping by.\n\n  3. this looks like a great antipasto dish! i dont think I'd have trouble gobbling this up all by myself! I wouldn't want to share!\n\n  4.
