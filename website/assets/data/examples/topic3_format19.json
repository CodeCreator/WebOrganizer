Guide them by example, subdue them by courtesy; they will learn shame, and come to be good.\n\n\nTo have committed every crime but that of being a father.\n\nEmil Cioran\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was simply a war crime. Straight-out war crime.\n\nNoam Chomsky\n\nCrime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.\n\nDame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie\n\nMurder is unique in that it abolishes the party it injures, so that society has to take the place of the victim and on his behalf demand atonement or grant forgiveness; it is the one crime in which society has a direct interest.\n\nW.H. Auden\n\nIf a father commands a son to commit a crime so terrible that the son can't do it and live with himself, then is it betrayal for the son to disobey his father?\n\nOrson Scott Card\n\nMurder is a horror, but an often necessary horror, never criminal, which it is essential to tolerate in a republican State. Is it or is it not a crime? If it is not, why make laws for its punishment? And if it is, by what barbarous logic do you, to punish it, duplicate it by another crime?\n\nMarquis De Sade\n\nPunishment is the last and the least effective instrument in the hands of the legislator for the prevention of crime.\n\nJohn Ruskin\n\nSome day, even the experts will figure out, that crime is not caused by rap music...or even my music, but by a power structure of self-absorbed property owners so brain dead and stupid they won't even see that if you're too goddamn greedy to pay taxes for schools and services, they're not going to be any good any more! And that uneducated time bombs are a very poor investment as a future work force. And if you go on teaching people that life is cheap, and leave them to rot in ghettos and jails, they may one day feel justified in coming back to rob and kill you. Duh!\n\nJello Biafra\n\nWhy would you shed a tear for them when they in return crack a smile for your loss because of the impending extra money they will receive in their next paycheck for sitting at your loved ones crime scene of 6 hours because of the overtime they will accrue.\n\nChristopher Jordan Dorner\n\nWhen your family members die, they just see you as extra overtime at a crime scene and at a perimeter.\n\nChristopher Jordan Dorner\n\nHe felt at once betrayed and betrayer, deceived and deceiver. He was a criminal forced into crime, an unwilling whore.\n\nPeter Benchley\nSocial Media\nOur Partners",
