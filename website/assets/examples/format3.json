        "text":"Custom Code Guidelines\n\nOur editor is very flexible in that you can extend the functionality of your site by adding any custom script or code, though the custom code has a tendency to break or disable the editor or require other steps to be done to work. Because of that, we have some guidelines that you should follow whenever testing custom code.\n\n\nIf you are working with custom code, it is good to know that scripts and resources can only be loaded in the same HTTP or HTTPS.\n\nThe editor by default is always loaded in HTTPS. If you are using an HTTP script in the editor, it will not be visible in the editor since it is loaded over a secure connection, but will be visible on the live site since it is loading in an unsecured connection.\n\nTo fix this, it is always better to load your resources over a secure connection.\n\nCustom Header Code\n\nWhen adding custom code to a header, create a duplicate of the site, and test your code on the duplicate site. If it fails, you can simply delete the site.\n\nAlternatively, you can test the header code on a separate, blank page on the same site. If the page crashes, simply delete the page or access the code via developer mode.\n\nCustom Page Code\n\nWhen adding custom code to a page:\n\n  1. Create a duplicate of the page, then add in your custom code.\n  2. If it fails, you can actually navigate to the page's HTML\/CSS by going to another page and accessing developer mode from there.\n  3. You can also delete the page and start again by creating a duplicate.\n  4. If custom code is on your homepage, you can try accessing your editor by adding a \/contact or some other URL to the end of your editor's link.\n\nPage Speed Optimization\n\nPage speed optimization affects how certain scripts are run. We run PageSpeed optimization on most pages in Duda, which can cause issues with your custom code. When troubleshooting code, you can see if it is a PageSpeed issue by:\n\n  1. Duplicating the page with your scripts.\n  2. Changing the URL to \"testing_scripts.\"\n  3. Publishing and checking the page on your live site.\n\nIf your code works on that page, contact support to turn off PageSpeed optimization for your site.\n\nIf you are using a script, you can also try making sure your script runs asynchronously\u2014it is not guaranteed, but it sometimes can solve the issue with scripts not executing properly in the browser.\n\nTo enable async on scripts, alter your code using the following:\n\n  \u2022 Old code: <script src=\u201d\u201d><\/script>\n  \u2022 New code: <script src=\u201d\u201d async defer><\/script>\n\nDisable Animated Navigation\n\nDuda's animated navigation feature often interferes with the way the custom code is loaded. You can disable animated navigation in responsive sites by right-clicking your navigation element in your editor, click Edit, and click Turn off animated navigation.\n\n\nA site that is broken by custom code normally loads a blank page in the editor (or breaks your editing features). If custom code broke your site, there are several options available:\n\n  \u2022 If you have a backup, in the left panel, click Settings, click Backup Site, and restore to a backup.\n  \u2022 Log in to which is a more code friendly version of our platform.\n  \u2022 If you are unable to access that in your editor by loading it, you might be able to workaround it by loading a new page.\n\n    To fix this issue, try accessing your editor on a new page. You can do this by entering a different URL in your editor link. This is a link accessing the \"About Us\" page of a site, for example:\n\n  \u2022 If the editor is broken, try to force open the editor by using the keyboard shortcut for the element inspector\n    \u2022 Mac. Command+Option+C\n    \u2022 PC. Ctrl+Alt+C\n  \u2022 If custom code is not running correctly, try disabling AJAX Page Changing (Quick Navigation) in the Header HTML.\n\nDuda's Custom Code Policy\n\nDue to the unpredictable nature of custom code, we are unable to troubleshoot why a custom coded element might not be working on a site.\n\nWe currently do not have any developers available to troubleshoot custom code, so please follow the guidelines above when experimenting with custom code on your site.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\n\nFeedback on this article\n\n\nPlease sign in to leave a comment.\n\n\nPlease Log in as a Pro\n\nPriority Phone Support is available exclusively to Pros.

These are the codes that are required for basic emissions fault diagnosis.\n\nHow To Fix P0089 ?\n\nDeactivation of cylinders is achieved by releasing a synchroniser pin that normally interlocks the cam follower and rocker arms. P0089 code resolves the synchroniser pin is released using hydraulic pressure which is controlled by a dedicated solenoid.\n\nP0089 Code Description:\n\nIs the fuel pump sometimes not priming when you turn the key to ON(II)? Start by measuring the fuel pressure and checking whether you have bright white-bluish spark at all four plugs. The mechanical timing is also something that you should check, as we mentioned above. When you see P0089 engine fault code on your engine code reader this description will help you.\n\nP Codes List of all Powertrain codes.\n\nFinal Step: In the definitions listed below, there is a test drive recommended after you've completed any repairs to see if the condition is fixed. Before you take a test drive after a repair, always erase the P Code(s) first. This will turn the check engine light off and then you will know if the check engine light returns, you've got further diagnostics to complete.\n\nThis engine code information is presented for information purposes only.
