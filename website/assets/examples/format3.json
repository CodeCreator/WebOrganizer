Recent changes make it even better. The program now pays the cost of some preparatory courses for college and graduate school entrance exams. Also, eligibility has been expanded to some officer training school graduates and surviving spouses.\u00a0 The education benefit provides many military men and women with education opportunities that otherwise might not be available.\n\n  \u2022 The Post-9\/11 GI Bill\n  \u2022 Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty (MGIB-AD)\n  \u2022 Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR)\n  \u2022 Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) Veterans Educational Assistance Program\n  \u2022 \u00a0(VEAP) Educational Assistance Test Program (Section 901)\n  \u2022 Survivors\u2019 and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA)\n  \u2022 National Call to Service Program\n  \u2022 Veterans Retraining Assistance Program\n\nFor more information about the program you are interested in\u00a0visit the VA education resource.\n\nVA Work\/Study Program\n\u00a0If you've ever had the need to visit or call one of our offices, you may have been assisted by a veteran working for us through the Veteran Affairs Education Program.

This wire CANNOT be used on regular power mode because of it's fumes provenient to the Nickel degradation and that's bad to inhale.\n\n\nNichrome 80 is another wire type that gained popularity with vapers to use for their\u00a0RBA\u00a0coil builds. Although a lot of vapers still swear by it, slowly kanthal is starting to take its place. Nichrome 80 is an alloy of nickel and chromium, it is composed of 80% nickel and 20% chromium.\n\nCompared to kanthal wire, nichrome is much less heat resistant at 2462 degrees Fahrenheit, but it heats up much quicker than kanthal. Because it heats up much faster, nichrome 80 is very popular among sub-ohm cloud chasing vapers.\n\n\nTitanium Wire, works pretty much like the previous one, but it gives you higher resistance then NI200, better ramp up or quick heat and quick cool down, and just like NI200 this wire CANNOT be used on regular power mode because of possible formation of Titanium Dioxide and that's bad to inhale.\n\n\nStainless Steel Wire, on the other hand, can and should be used just as kanthal on regular power mode devices, but with the advantage that it can also be used on temperature control mode on devices that have that function. You can still use it on Titanium temperature control mode on most devices out now but you need to start on the minimum temperature like 200\u00baF (100\u00baC) because the Stainless Steel Wire Temperature Coefficient is low compared to Titanium the temperatures will be that off. Me and also other reviewers and vapers agree that the flavor coming from the vapor produced on a coil with this wire, tastes more clean and crispy.\n\n\nTo conclude, Kanthal has a higher Max Operating Temperature which will give it a longer life on your RDA.\u00a0 Nichrome heats up at a faster rate and is sometimes preferred for this reason for \"cloud chasing\" or sub-ohm builds. Some people taste a difference between Kanthal and Nichrome stating a more metallic taste from the Iron in Kanthal. It depends on your personal sensitivity to metals, and what you like. It is all subjective and really comes down to what you personally like!",
