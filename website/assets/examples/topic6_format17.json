        "text":"Is jack from 'will and grace' gay in real life?\n\n\nNo, The actor that plays Jack, Sean Hayes, is actually straight and has been married for 2 years. AnswerParty!\n\nMore Info:\n\ngay Television\n\nWill & Grace is an American television sitcom, originally based on the relationship between William Truman and Grace Adler, and is set in New York City. It was broadcast on NBC from September 21, 1998 to May 18, 2006 for a total of eight seasons. Will & Grace was, during its original run, the most successful television series with gay principal characters. It still enjoys success in syndication.\n\nDespite initial criticism for its particular portrayal of homosexual characters, it went on to become a staple of NBC's Must See TV Thursday night lineup. It was ensconced in the Nielsen top 20 for half of its network run. The show was the highest-rated sitcom among adults 18\u201349, from 2001 and 2005. Throughout its eight-year run, Will & Grace earned 16 Emmy Awards and 83 nominations.\n\nSean Hayes Jack\n\n\"A Chorus Lie\" is the sixteenth episode of the American television series Will & Grace's fourth season. It was written by Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally and directed by series producer James Burrows. The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 7, 2002. Guest stars in \"A Chorus Lie\" include Matt Damon, Leslie Jordan, and Patrick Kerr.\n\nIn the episode, Jack (Sean Hayes) begins a rivalry with a fellow named Owen (Matt Damon). They are competing to be the final entrant in a gay men's chorus, and after learning that Owen is straight, Jack tries to \"in\" him with help from Grace (Debra Messing). Meanwhile, Karen (Megan Mullally) tries to pass off Will (Eric McCormack) as her lover and not her lawyer when she discovers that she is the object of pity for being single at her own Valentine's Day party.\n\n\nEntertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.\n\nThe experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.\n\nIn journalism, a human interest story is a feature story that discusses a person or people in an emotional way. It presents people and their problems, concerns, or achievements in a way that brings about interest, sympathy or motivation in the reader or viewer.\n\nHuman interest stories may be \"the story behind the story\" about an event, organization, or otherwise faceless historical happening, such as about the life of an individual soldier during wartime, an interview with a survivor of a natural disaster, a random act of kindness or profile of someone known for a career achievement.\n\nA social issue (also called a social problem or a social situation) is an issue that relates to society's perception of a person's personal lives. Different cultures have different perceptions and what may be \"normal\" behavior in one society may be a significant social issue in another society. Social issues are distinguished from economic issues. Some issues have both social and economic aspects, such as immigration. There are also issues that don't fall into either category, such as wars.\n\nThomas Paine, in Rights of Man and Common Sense, addresses man's duty to \"allow the same rights to others as we allow ourselves\". The failure to do so causes the birth of a social issue.\n\n\nRelated Websites:\n\nTerms of service | About",

        "text":"Music \u00bb Feature\n\nQ&A with 902 NonStop Records' Ally Dee\n\nCatch tomorrow's stacked lineup for Rap Therapy\n\n\nAlly Dee - TARA RYAN\n  \u2022 Tara Ryan\n  \u2022 Ally Dee\n\nAlly Dee and Ryszky Biz run 902 NonStop Records, intensely repping local hip-hop. With both a radio show and regular rap showcases, Dee puts in hard work for a scene he clearly loves. Friday, March 6, the Rap Therapy event (Jacob's Lounge, 9pm, $5 in advance, $10 at the door) features a handful of some established and new hip-hop voices, and a great chance to see some local talent.\n\nQ: What does rap therapy mean to you?\nA: Rap Therapy is the most recent album release from Ryszky Biz, the title is an accurate description of the line-up of tracks on the album. It all comes from the heart and is based on real experiences. It\u2019s a chance to vent or voice an opinion. For the 902 NonStop Records squad, music is the life we live, it\u2019s a way to explore creativity, be expressive, offer a message to the world and also a great form of therapy.\n\nQ: What made you choose hip-hop?\nA: Music has been a big part of my life from a very young age, both enjoying and creating, there\u2019s a lot of freedom for expression and exploration without any limits. From the first time that I heard Licensed To Ill from the Beastie Boys at age nine I was hooked.\n\nQ: Some of these artists on Friday\u2019s showcase are newer to the scene, right?\nA: A few of the artists are, including Slim The Gentlemen and Tara Ryan. Slim had his first showing on an album in the fall of 2014 when we released They\u2019re Coming\u2014a Halloween\/zombie apocalypse themed album. Tara Ryan broke on the scene a few months ago and has been gathering steam and has developed some great material which she performed for the first time during the Ryszky Biz Rap Therapy cd release party at Jacob\u2019s Lounge on February 6th.\n\nThe last five years saw me link with Ryszky Biz and Red Panther Studio and releasing six mixtapes before creating 902 NonStop Records. We\u2019ve released five albums, including our Confident album which was done in support of and with the support of the YMCA Strong Kids Campaign. We\u2019ll be handing over the proceeds from our tour to the Community Relations Manager and Strong Kids Champions on March 14 at Hugo\u2019s Bar and Grill during a hip-hop showcase with Jayo Productions. Vadell Gabriel and The Yangsta have been around for a spell and have their own show on CKDU as well on Monday evenings, Pyrate Radio.\n\nQ: How has your radio show been going?\nA: Heard On Air has been gathering a larger audience and is constantly seeking music from other Canadian hip-hop and R&B artists, especially local and Maritime artists. There is a lot of talent in this area. It\u2019s been great being a part of the CKDU community. Since the show has started, a whole new set of doors have started to open. The show is in the process of being syndicated for play on other stations both FM and internet.\n\nQ: What\u2019s next for 902 NonStop?\nA: We have several releases planned for this year including T.O.G. from Stack Loot Divide, The Purge from myself and Just Another Rap Genius from Ryszky Biz followed by releases from DL and Slim The Gentlemen.\n\nQ: Other than Saturday\u2019s Trina show, it\u2019s been pretty rare to see two female rappers on a bill, I was really impressed to see two female MCs on this lineup. Is a fairer representation something that\u2019s important to you?\nA: I heard that the Trina show was pretty dope, and it is always awesome to catch Realeyez live, she always excites the crowd. Recently she performed at two of our shows and we look forward to more performances with her. It was great to see the all-queen cypher and night of poetry in December at AlterEgos for Chix in the Mix, and we\u2019re pretty pumped about having both Tara Ryan and JPimpin\u2019 on the lineup for the Rap Therapy show. It would be pretty boss to see much more female talent at hip-hop events, they bring a strong message with their music and a strong stage presence. A fairer representation would be kickass to experience. We welcome any opportunity to work with female MCs and singers.\n\nAdd a comment\n\nRemember, it's entirely possible to disagree without spiralling into a thread of negativity and personal attacks.

In issue #17, he became the first superhero to die, although the character would go on to be revived several times from the 1960s onwards.\n\nWho is the strongest DC or Marvel?\n\nMore of Marvel\u2019s characters have won in more categories, but DC\u2019s victors far outshine their competition. No one from the Marvel Universe or the DC Universe compares to Superman, whereas Iron Man and Hawkeye just barely edge out their rivals. Still, we\u2019d say that Marvel has stronger characters for now.\n\nWho has more heroes DC or Marvel?\n\nThe short answer is that DC has wayyyy more characters than MARVEL. \u2026 Because of this, DC\u2019s heroes, including the C-class characters, clocks in at around 1900 characters, topping MARVEL by a whopping 300 characters (which is actually quite a lot).\n\nWho is the weakest superhero in DC?\n\nColor KidThough he has a lot of heart and some really interesting\u2014and helpful! \u2014abilities, Color Kid is TRULY the weakest DC Comics hero.\n\nWho is the kindest superhero?\n\npeter parkerin the ultimate universe, he took a bullet to save captain america,than raced to save his aunt and girlfriend from his greatest foes,before dying in aunt mays arms. truly, peter parker is the kindest of heroes.\n\nWhich is older DC or Marvel?\n\nThat\u2019s the most important thing to know, that DC was there first. They were called Detective Comics, Inc, later to be called National Publications, later to be called DC, and they invented superheroes with Action Comics #1. \u2026 In 1961 they became Marvel Comics and nothing had changed \u2013 they were still chasing trends.\n\nWho is the youngest avenger?\n\n1 Youngest: Scarlet Witch.\n\nWho is the slowest superhero?\n\nSnailmanSnailman (Slowest Superhero in the World) Powers\/Abilities: Snailman can walk up walls (he says \u201ccreep,\u201d but that\u2019s referencing his lack of speed, rather than his style of movement) and moves slower than a three-legged tortoise. In costume or out, he leaves behind a sticky \u201csnail trail\u201d wherever he walks.\n\nWho is the fastest avenger?\n\nCaptain America secretly has record-breaking speed, but he doesn\u2019t want anyone else \u2013 including his fellow Avengers \u2013 to know. Warning! Spoilers for Avengers #45 below! Captain America is one of the strongest heroes in the Marvel Universe, but he is also secretly one of the fastest Avengers and people in the world.\n\nCan Thor kill Superman?\n\nYes, Thor has magic on his side and can hurt Superman. However, Superman has defeated magical foes in the past because he doesn\u2019t just stand there and let them hit him with magic.\n\nWho can beat Superman in Marvel?\n\nIn terms of physical strength, Sentry is the most powerful being in the entire Marvel universe, and his powers are similar to Superman. It\u2019s just that Sentry has a much more advanced brain and also has telepathic abilities, which allows him to win over Superman.\n\nWho can beat Superman?\n\nHere are 10 ultra-strong beings who might just be able to pull off the impossible against Superman without Kryptonite.1 The Presence. The Presence in the DC Universe is basically the code name for God.2 Mister Mxyzptlk. \u2026 3 Darkseid. \u2026 4 Anti-Monitor. \u2026 5 Parallax. \u2026 6 Doctor Manhattan. \u2026 7 Captain Atom. \u2026 8 Spectre. \u2026 More items\u2026\u2022Nov 16, 2020\n\nWho is the oldest superhero in Marvel?\n\nGalactus1 Galactus (Before Time) He\u2019s also insanely old. Galactus actually existed before this universe \u2013 meaning he existed before the one all these ancient characters created and inhabit \u2013 and that likely makes him the oldest character currently in the Marvel Universe.\n\nWho is the weakest avenger?\n\nMCU: 5 Most Powerful Members of the Avengers (& 5 of the Weakest)1 Weakest: Captain America.2 Strongest: Thor. \u2026 3 Weakest: Winter Soldier. \u2026 4 Strongest: Vision. \u2026 5 Weakest: Falcon. \u2026 6 Strongest: Scarlet Witch. \u2026 7 Weakest: Black Widow. \u2026 8 Strongest: Doctor Strange. \u2026 More items\u2026\u2022Dec 2, 2020\n\nWHO has lifted Thor\u2019s hammer?\n\nOther than Thor and Odin, certain other individuals have proven capable of lifting Mjolnir in the primary continuity:Roger \u201cRed\u201d Norvell (Actually a deliberate ruse by Odin)Beta Ray Bill.Captain America.Eric Masterson.Bor (Thor\u2019s grandfather)Buri (also known as Tiwaz, Thor\u2019s great-grandfather)Loki.Jane Foster.More items\u2026\n\nWho is the laziest superhero?\n\nHere are twelve times superheroes have been caught using their powers to be lazy slackers.8 Iceman.7 The Thing.6 Marvel Girl\/Phoenix.5 Molecule Man.4 Peter Parker.3 Santa Claus.2 Doctor Manhattan.1 She-Hulk.More items\u2026\u2022Jan 3, 2017\n\nAdd a comment",
