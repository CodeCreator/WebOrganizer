        "text":"Looks like you're in . Go to your local store?\n\nTime Left:\n\nVaporizer UK News\n\n5 Common Vaping Myths - Did You Fall For These?\n\nPosted on May 31, 2017\n\nVaping is a new phenomenon in the UK herb scene and understandably there\u2019s a certain level of skepticism surrounding it. Some of the claims we\u2019ve seen circulating are totally wrong! So we\u2019ve compiled the most egregious claims and debunked each one!\n\n\n1. Vaping Smells\n\nHerb certainly does have a distinctive smell. It\u2019s something that every aficionado knows. It lingers for hours, can sink into your hair and clothes and, depending on the strain, can be very pungent indeed! Some of us put a lot of effort into disguising or banishing that smell altogether! Some people worry that the diffusion of herb into vapor can cause the smell to travel further and linger longer.\n\nThe good news is that the vapor doesn\u2019t hang in the air as long as smoke does. This is because vapor isn\u2019t as dense as smoke and simply diffuses into the air.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there\u2019s no smell; there is. So don\u2019t expect your vape to protect you from all prying nostrils. You simply needn\u2019t worry about it lingering in your hair, clothes, or house!\n\n\n2. Vaping Isn\u2019t As Strong As Smoking Herb\n\nTo some fire = stronger. This isn\u2019t necessarily true. Ok a hit from a blunt is going to be stronger than a hit from a vape, this isn\u2019t because a vape is somehow weaker, it\u2019s just that each hit is a bit more mellow. Vaporizers work by taking advantage of the boiling temperatures of the active ingredients in herb. So when you take a hit from a vape you\u2019re inhaling the same chemicals as you would from a blunt or bong. The difference is the concentration; a hit from a blunt might have a higher concentration of cannabinoids but it will also come with hot smoke, tar, carcinogens, and other toxins.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel the effects of the active ingredients just as much as you would from a blunt, it\u2019s the same amount of THC it might just take a few hits more. Thanks to how a vape works, those hits will go down MUCH easier.\n\n\n3. It\u2019s Only For Hipster Douchebags\n\nOk Ok, the ecig and vape scene has been co opted by somewhat insufferable douches, we can\u2019t lie; everyone\u2019s seen that vapenation video. However dry herb vaporizers, while similar in appearance, are a different beast. Dry herb vapes are used by everyone from seasoned herb fans, to patients looking for herbs medicinal effects. The best thing about plant vapes, such as the Da Vinci IQ, is that they have an adjustable temperature setting. This allows you to actually change which active ingredients are being boiled off in your herb and what effects you are feeling! This is what makes dry herb vapes something for everyone, from douchebag hipsters to old grannies recovering from their hip replacement.\n\n\n4 It\u2019s Wasteful\n\nWhen you light a bowl you know that everything in that bowl will be put to use. By the end of it there\u2019s nothing left! It\u2019s all smoked up. When you pack a vape how do you know that all your herb is being put to good use? After all, when you use it up there\u2019s still a lot of matter left in the chamber.\n\nVapes are actually far more efficient than combustion when it comes to your herb. None of your herb will be burnt off into thin air, nearly all of the active ingredients will be converted into vapor!\n\nIt becomes even more efficient when you grind your herb before putting it into your vape. Grinding your heb increases the surface area that is exposed to the heating element of your vaporizer; which means more vapor and less wasted herb.\n\n5 It tastes Of Burnt Popcorn\n\nSome complain that every hit from a vaporizer holds the taint of some nasty burnt popcorn. These people either don\u2019t know how to use a vaporizer or are parroting the words of someone who doesn\u2019t know how to use a vaporizer. If you taste burnt popcorn then your herb is used up! All the active ingredients are gone and it\u2019s now time to switch it out for a fresh batch. Once you do that you can sit back and enjoy the tasty flavour of your herb again.\n\n\n\nTestimonials and Reviews at",

        "text":"4 Reasons To Get Braces For Crowded Teeth\n\n2 February 2017\n\u00a0Categories: Dentist, Blog\n\n\nWhen you have a mouth full of crowded teeth, they can cause problems in numerous ways. It is wise to get the teeth repaired before you end up with dental problems that are more severe. Braces are an effective method for helping crowded teeth move further apart. You will also find that braces are beneficial in a few other ways concerning your dental health as well. Take a look at the information in this article to gain more insight about braces.\n\n1. Chewing Food Will Be Less Painful\n\nIt can be painful to chew food when you have crowded teeth in your mouth. The pain stems from having to chew food in a certain way, especially if there is a large amount of crowding. Improper chewing also puts more stress on your jawbones, which is another cause of the pain. Braces can resolve the problem and make eating a more pleasant experience.\n\n2. There Will Be a Smaller Risk for Gum Disease\n\nWhen teeth are crowding, brushing them can be a complicated task. The closeness and uneven way the teeth are situated in your gums makes it hard for a toothbrush to reach every small space. You end up with plaque being left on your teeth, which can eventually lead to gum disease. Brushing can be done more thoroughly after your teeth are corrected with braces.\n\n3. You Can Opt for Clear Aligners or Metal Braces\n\nThere is more than one option for braces that you can choose from. If you don't mind metal being placed on your teeth, metal braces might work for you. Just make sure to thoroughly clean the braces after they are installed to prevent food from getting stuck in them. You also have the option of wearing clear Invisalign aligners, which does the same job as metal braces. The aligners can be removed when you are eating food, but must be worn for the majority of each day.\n\n4. Teeth Will Experience Wear in an Even Manner\n\nYou must understand that crowded and uneven teeth lead to some of them being used more than others. The teeth that are used the most become worn out a lot faster than those that are hardly used. You can experience more dental issues when teeth do not wear in an even manner. Speak to an orthodontist, such as John C. Matunas D.D.S., PA,\u00a0to get examined so you will know if braces are right for correcting your crowded teeth.",

        "text":"5 Ways To Naturally Treat Burns\n\nbeth March 4, 2013\n\n\nNaturally Treating BurnsImage by\u00a0rogersmj\n\nBurns happen easily. It doesn\u201dt matter how you get them, by bumping into the clothes iron or grabbing something hot off the stove, they hurt! Not only do they hurt but if left untreated they can become infected, product nasty scars, and overall become much worse than they have to be. Many store bought burn creams contain a list of unfavorable ingredients that, while your finger might feel better, your body wont appreciate.\n\nInstead, naturally treat your burns with things that are just as easy to make sure you have on hand.\n\n**Note, this post in in reference to minor burns. If you get a serious burn seek medical advice.\n\nLavender Essential Oil\n\nLavender essential oil will work wonders to cool and calm a burn. It also naturally has\u00a0antibiotic\u00a0and antiseptic\u00a0properties\u00a0that will keep the burn from getting infected. Not to mention the calming effect the the scent itself can have when your a little\u00a0distraught\u00a0at having\u00a0burned\u00a0yourself to begin casino online with.\n\nRaw Honey\n\nRaw honey is\u00a0antibacterial and very healthy for the skin. This attributes to it\u201ds ability to lower the risk of scarring. It also works well to relieve the pain. Raw honey\u00a0contains natural enzymes, antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins that make it a great wound fighter.\u00a0Simply clean the wound and apply the honey to the burn itself and the area around it. You can repeat this as needed.\n\n\nThis herb has been used for centuries for many skin issues \u2013 including burns. It has\u00a0antibacterial, anti-fungal, and antiviral properties which make it great to promote healing and keep infection at bay. An easy way to apply this useful herb is to boil it as a tea. After you let the tea cool dip a cloth in it and apply it as a compress. You can also find it directly as an oil or use the herb itself in a homemade cream to keep on hand.\n\nAloe Vera\n\nChances are you have this plant around the house \u2013 and if not you should get one. Aloe is full of beneficial nutrients that promote healing and relieve pain. By keeping a plant on hand you will get the most benefit of this. The longer the aloe has been cut from the plant the more healing benefits are lost. \u00a0Some store bought aloe might also contain\u00a0unnecessary\u00a0additives and preservatives that you would prefer to avoid when healing.\n\nCoconut Oil\n\nIs there anything coconut oil can\u201dt do? Coconut oil has long been known to prevent infections that could be caused by bacteria. It also speeds healing.

There are so many articles and posts about things used to \u201ctreat and heal\u201d various minor ailments from colds to burns to cuts and scrapes. Why must we always treat everything with something? Why can\u2019t we just let things run the course and heal by themselves? When someone in my house gets a burn, we put in under cold running water for a few minutes. Then nothing, no ointments, no lavender oils, nothing. Colds? I do nothing, no elderberry, no saline drops, no decongestants, nothing. Cuts and scrapes? Wash it with soap and water, then maybe a dry bandaid, perhaps a dab of antibiotic ointment one time right after it happens, then nothing. Just having trouble understanding the push to always treat something or make it heal faster. Maybe I\u2019m just too practical?\n\n\n    \u2022 Pam,\n      That\u2019s really a matter of preference. In our home we don\u2019t always do something either. For instance, with a fever we let it run its course. With a cold we make things more comfortable, we boost our immune systems, we support our body in doing its job \u2013 but we don\u2019t interrupt it. We just enhance it. Same for burns \u2013 we aid the body in doing its job and make things a little less painful.\n\n\n    \u2022 The article is aimed at sharing natural healing methods rather than conventional methods like \u201cantibiotic ointment\u201d. You\u2019d have better success with using a good brand lavender oil as it is antibiotic, antiseptic, calming and healing.\n\n\n  2.
