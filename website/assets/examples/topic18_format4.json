I find it easier for me, to forgive someone, than to ask for forgiveness. Over the High Holidays, I did venture down that very difficult path...and though it was hard for me...I did it and am glad that I did. I not only learned something about the people that I spoke with, I learned something about myself. epiphany of sorts I suppose. Thank you for your article!\n\n(4) scott, September 7, 2013 5:58 AM\n\nLet it go. It's harder than you think.\n\nThere's a movie called \"a Bronx Tale\" De Nero says that if you want to get rid of someone, lend them money they can afford to repay. They will never bother you again. It's true.\n\nI've been there in my life, having borrowed money that it took me a year to repay...I avoided the guy until I had the money. I was ashamed. And to this day that relationship is strained. Not because the guy is mad at me...he understood and was glad to help. It's me. I'm embarrassed about not keeping my commitment and can't handle that he knows how I behaved. I've made teshuvah...I repayed the money with interest. I asked for forgiveness. And he told me that he forgave me and would do it again. But I can't accept that...maybe I never will be able to.\n\nAfter Adam and Eve ate the fruit...G*d went looking for them. They being unwilling to return to him...he went looking to call them back. Think about it...he was looking for them to give them an opportunity to receive forgiveness. Amazing. Instead they hid from him and they lied. I believe that he was ready to forgive, but they were not able to accept that forgiveness. They chose guilt and shame over Hashem. Guilt and shame became their ruler. They didn't trust his attribute of mercy. And for that matter kingship. They denied him the kings right to pardon. They doubted the kings ability to pardon.\n\nThe rest of history I think is just about getting humans to a place where we can accept his mercy and kingship. Where we can accept his pardon and trust his ability to let it go and continue our relationship with him as if nothing had changed.\n\nHe created Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur as rituals to give us a chance each year to do what Adam and Eve couldn't. We're supposed to do what we need to do in order to end the separation and accept his attributes of mercy and kingship. It's the hardest thing we can do as Jews.\n\nSusan, August 17, 2014 2:16 AM\n\nThank you Scott\n\nYour comment is a gift from Hashem--\n\n(3) Janice, September 6, 2013 5:10 AM\n\nForgiveness or Pardon\n\nTo error is human to give a Pardon is Kingship\/Devine; issue the pardon and your emotions will follow.\n\n(2) Anonymous, September 3, 2013 9:13 PM\n\nHave you been eavesdropping on my life!? lol.

        "text":"Have you seen the trailor for Mel Gibson\u2019s film about the last 12 hours of Christ\u2019s life? This has been the subject of much debate, as Jewish leaders raise concerns about anti-Semitism and others respond. Here are some responses from people who have actually seen a rough cut at the behest of the New York Post, which apparently bootlegged a copy (the uniform reaction \u2014 except from the \u201cPost reader\u201d \u2014 was that the film unfairly portrayed Jews).\n\nAmitai Etzioni, who has been blogging regularly on this topic, had an interesting take on this flap way back in September:\n\nThose who will wrap themselves in the First Amendment should note that no one is arguing that the government should ban the movie \u2014 only that it is morally not right. There are many things we can say about African Americans, Jews, and for that matter about Catholics, which best remain unsaid.\n\nWhile I suspect that there will be no uniform Mormon response to this film, my inclination is to agree with Etzioni.\n\n8 comments for \u201cPassion\n\n  1. December 1, 2003 at 10:41 am\n\n    I am curious as to your thoughts then on the LDS Church\u2019s productions on Christ\u2019s crucifixion such as The Lamb of God and others. We clearly believe, indeed the Book of Mormon teaches, that the Jewish leadership at the time of Christ was responsible for Christ\u2019s illegal conviction and crucifixion. Of course, we don\u2019t believe in any group guilt, but we adhere to the historical facts of His death. From my understanding, Mel Gibson has merely stuck to the historical facts as taken directly from the text of the gospels. Do religious groups who teach from the gospels threaten the world with anti-semitism?\n\n  2. Taylor\n    December 1, 2003 at 5:14 pm\n\n    Brent writes- \u201cthe Book of Mormon teaches that Jewish leadership at the time of Christ was responsible for Christ\u2019s illegal conviction and crucifixion.\u201d I am not sure that the conviction was illegal, and I don\u2019t think that the Book of Mormon teaches that (though I may be mistaken). However, this is a far cry from the ADL\u2019s accusations about the Passion:\n    \u201cThe film portrays Jewish authorities and the Jewish \u201cmob\u201d as forcing the decision to torture and execute Jesus, thus assuming responsibility for the crucifixion.\n    The film relies on sinister medieval stereotypes, portraying Jews as blood-thirsty, sadistic and money-hungry enemies of God who lack compassion and humanity.\n    The film relies on historical errors, chief among them its depiction of the Jewish high priest controlling Pontius Pilate\n    The film uses an anti-Jewish account of a 19th century mystical anti-Semitic nun, distorts New Testament interpretation by selectively citing passages to weave a narrative that oversimplifies history, and is hostile to Jews and Judaism.\n    The film portrays Jews who adhere to their Jewish faith as enemies of God and the locus of evil.\u201d\n\n    I don\u2019t think that \u201cinformed\u201d :) Mormons believe any of these things.\n\n    Much of NT scholarship is looking at how the term \u201cIoudaioi\u201d is used. It is often translated as \u201cJews,\u201d but more often probably means \u201cJudeans,\u201d to refer to the people of Judea, and not all Jews (this is especially true when the Judeans cry that their blood be responsible, a reference to the destruction of Jerusalem, not all Jews). It would be interesting to see if the BoM yeilds the same results. The so-called \u201chistorical facts\u201d actually probably piont to a minimal involvement of any Jews except for a few leaders, and the death of Jesus was probably mostly a Roman affair. The blame of the Jews by both NT and BoM writers is rooted in both political and theological arguments, not historical ones. Theologically, the theme of the righteous prophet rejected by his own people is at the heart of much of OT narrative. However, this idea has an unfortunate history in our own culture, far removed from ancient Israel. We should be especially reflexive about how we use it today.\n\n  3. December 1, 2003 at 10:15 pm\n\n    I am aware of what the ADL claims. Unfortunately, it does not square with what those who have actually seen the film in its rough form relate. Mel Gibson and many others have stated that the movie is based almost entirely on the accounts of the gospel and the claim that the movie is based on the writings of a 19th century mystic ant-semitic nun have been refuted. I guess my main point is that the historical fact is both that those mainly responsible for Christ\u2019s death and also his followers (and Christ himself) may properly be called Jews regardless of the definition we look to. It may be an unpleasant fact that the Jewish leadership and the \u201crabble\u201d who supported them called for Christ\u2019s execution, but it remains a fact.\n\n  4. Jooniper\n    February 26, 2004 at 7:23 pm\n\n    I just came from a BYU religion class and my professor was one of 7 professors asked by the comunity to see the film and give an opinion. 6 to 1, the professors said they would not discourage seeing it. The one who said he would discourage it was my professor, and here were his reasons (as far as I understand):\n    1) Obviously the film is gruesome and disturbing\n    2)It does have some ideas in it not supported by the bible and does seem to go out of its way to play the jews (it takes the blame away from Pilate), and it has Caiaphas mocking Christ on the cross. Sounds like Gibson took some artistic license.\n    The point is, so long as Mormons have a firm graps of the truth AND recognize their own sensitivites to violence (some mormons may be able to handle it, some won\u2019t\u2026) watching the Passion is a personal decision, and viewers can watch the film and allow it to make them think about thier own beliefs.\n\n  5. Ben\n    February 26, 2004 at 7:31 pm\n\n    Can you tell us who the \u201cFebruary Seven\u201d were Jooniper?\n\n  6. February 26, 2004 at 7:42 pm\n\n    \u201c\u2026for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.\u201d \u2013Acts 4:27-28\n\n  7. February 26, 2004 at 8:38 pm\n\n    Just to go with Aaron\u2019s comments, the book of Acts does seem to take a different view with respect to the Jews. The KJV is a tad obscuring on this so I\u2019ll quote the NIV.\n\n    \u201cNow, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Christ would suffer.\u201d (Acts 3:17)\n\n  8.

Constitutional amendments to strengthen minority rights and legislation for the implementation of constitutional guarantees;\n  2. Adequately financed and rationally conceived programs designed to facilitate the voluntary return of the country's refugees;\n  3. National Commission for Minority Affairs to promote peaceful dialogue between religious and ethnic groups;\n  4. A University in Nineveh Province;\n  5. Security for vulnerable minority communities;\n  6. Fulfillment of Iraq's obligation to respect international human rights instruments;\n  7. Increased representation of Christians in the federal and state parliaments; and\n  8. Increased investment in the infrastructure of previously marginalized areas populated mainly by minorities.\n\nDr. John Eibner, CEO of CSI's U.S. affiliate warned that the prospect of extinction still faces Iraq's ancient Christian community, and would do so until violent persecution ceases and basic human rights are guaranteed in word and deed.\n\nIn an interview with Iraq's Mosuli TV, Eibner noted that the considerable progress providing security in Mosul and surrounding Nineveh Province during the past year is reversible.\n\nSince the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003, nearly half of Iraq's approximately one million Christians have been forced by violence to flee the country, while many other remain in Iraq as destitute Internally Displaced People.\n\nThe Governor of Nineveh Province, Athil Al-Najifi, in his role as Conference Patron, announced that outside interference and instrumentalization of minorities in Nineveh is coming to an end, and expressed willingness to establish a mechanism, including all elements of civil society, to defend minority rights.\n\nWilliam Warda, President of the Hammurabi Human Rights Organization (HHRO) claimed that neither the Iraqi nor the American governments are acting with sufficient energy and foresight to end the violent persecution of Iraq's Christians and to create conditions for the return of refugees.\n\nThe Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Kirkuk, Louis Sako, urged Christians not to leave Iraq, emphasizing the need for an enduring Christian witness in the country.\n\nThe Conference was co-sponsored by CSI and by HHRO.\n\nMedia contact:\n\nChristian Solidarity International (CSI)\nElliott Daniels (919) 440-9729, elliott.daniels < a t>\n\nAlert \u00a0 IP Print \u00a0\u00a0Edit\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reply\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Re-Quote Top\n\nForums Topics\u00a0 Previous Topic Next Topic\n\nAssyria \\\u00e3-'sir-\u00e9-\u00e4\\ n (1998)\u00a0\u00a0 1:\u00a0 an ancient empire of Ashur\u00a0\u00a0 2:\u00a0 a democratic state in Bet-Nahren, Assyria (northern Iraq, northwestern Iran, southeastern Turkey and eastern Syria.)\u00a0\u00a0 3:\u00a0 a democratic state that fosters the social and political rights to all of its inhabitants irrespective of their religion, race, or gender\u00a0\u00a0 4:\u00a0 a democratic state that believes in the freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture in faithfulness to the principles of the United Nations Charter \u2014 Atour synonym\n\nEthnicity, Religion, Language\n\u00bb Israeli, Jewish, Hebrew\n\u00bb Assyrian, Christian, Aramaic\n\u00bb Saudi Arabian, Muslim, Arabic\nAssyrian \\\u00e3-'sir-\u00e9-an\\ adj or n (1998)\u00a0\u00a0 1:\u00a0 descendants of the ancient empire of Ashur\u00a0\u00a0 2:\u00a0 the Assyrians, although representing but one single nation as the direct heirs of the ancient Assyrian Empire, are now doctrinally divided, inter sese, into five principle ecclesiastically designated religious sects with their corresponding hierarchies and distinct church governments, namely, Church of the East, Chaldean, Maronite, Syriac Orthodox and Syriac Catholic.\u00a0 These formal divisions had their origin in the 5th century of the Christian Era.\u00a0 No one can coherently understand the Assyrians as a whole until he can distinguish that which is religion or church from that which is nation -- a matter which is particularly difficult for the people from the western world to understand; for in the East, by force of circumstances beyond their control, religion has been made, from time immemorial, virtually into a criterion of nationality.\u00a0\u00a0 3:\u00a0 the Assyrians have been referred to as Aramaean, Aramaye, Ashuraya, Ashureen, Ashuri, Ashuroyo, Assyrio-Chaldean, Aturaya, Chaldean, Chaldo, ChaldoAssyrian, ChaldoAssyrio, Jacobite, Kaldany, Kaldu, Kasdu, Malabar, Maronite, Maronaya, Nestorian, Nestornaye, Oromoye, Suraya, Syriac, Syrian, Syriani, Suryoye, Suryoyo and Telkeffee. \u2014 Assyrianism verb\n\nAramaic \\ar-\u00e9-'m\u00e1ik\\ n (1998)\u00a0\u00a0 1:\u00a0 a Semitic language which became the lingua franca of the Middle East during the ancient Assyrian empire.\u00a0\u00a0 2:\u00a0 has been referred to as Neo-Aramaic, Neo-Syriac, Classical Syriac, Syriac, Suryoyo, Swadaya and Turoyo.\n\nPlease consider the environment when disposing of this material \u2014 read, reuse, recycle. \u267b\nAIM | Atour: The State of Assyria | Terms of Service",

Mark Brown\n\nGalatians 6:7-16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luke 10:1-11, 16-20\n\n\u201c\u2026a new creation is everything.\u201d\u00a0 Words of Paul this morning.\u00a0 A new creation is everything.\u00a0 \u201cIf anyone is in Christ, he [or she] is a new creation.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cBehold, I make all things new!\u201d \u201cI am making a new heaven and a new earth.\u201d \u201cSing to the Lord a new song!\u201d\u00a0 There is a lot about \u201cnew\u201d in the Good News.\n\nNewness, engagement with the new, is part of our founder\u2019s vision of the religious life.\u00a0 In Fr. Benson\u2019s own words (one of his most quotable quotes): \u00a0\u201cThe religious is to be specially a man\u2014not simply of the day, but a man of the moment, a man precisely up to the mark of the times.\u00a0 This makes the religious\u2014so far from being the traditional imitator of by gone days\u2014most specially a man of the present moment and its life.\u00a0 His duties entirely throw him into the interests of the present moment.\u00a0 Eternity is in that moment, and all the energies which are given to eternity are given through that moment.\u00a0 The religious therefore reviews calmly, dispassionately, dutifully all the phenomena of the age in which he lives.\u00a0 He does not review them as things to deplore, but as things to rejoice in, and as things to be acted upon\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Church, the Body of Christ, is essentially progressive.\u00a0 And religious life is essentially progressive. Rooted in the past, grounded in the Eternal, but always renewing, always renovating.\u00a0 Rooted in a great tradition, to be sure, but engaging the present moment, engaging the new.\n\n\u201cA new creation is everything.\u201d\u00a0 The new creation, God\u2019s new creation, is happening here in this moment.\u00a0 The new creation unfolds before our very eyes.\n\nWe brothers try to live up to Fr. Benson\u2019s vision.\u00a0 We try to be men \u201cprecisely up to the mark of the times.\u201d\u00a0 We try to see ourselves part of this new creation unfolding in the present moment. Even, paradoxically, as we root ourselves in the great monastic tradition.\n\nSome recent renewals, recent renovations: A new rule\u2013the re-writing, an updating of our Rule of Life, finished about ten years ago.\u00a0 And, six to eight years ago, a process of organizational development, renewing our understanding of what it means today to live together in religious community. We came to a new understanding of how men living in Christian community can share authority in a mature way.\u00a0 A fairly rigid, top-down, hierarchical pattern (appropriate to another time and place) was replaced by something more fluid and dynamic, something characterized by mutual deference and collegiality.\n\nAnd more recently still: we are exploring the possibilities of new technology.\u00a0 Cautiously, but hopefully. (This sermon, for example, will soon enter cyberspace.)\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s really new at the monastery.\u00a0 Both new and renewing.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what we \u201cmen of the moment\u201d are discovering.\u00a0 And it\u2019s both new and renewing. Now, the mid-western white Anglo-Saxon protestant male region of my psyche cringes to tell you this.\u00a0 But\u2026we \u201cmen of the moment\u201d need money. That\u2019s what\u2019s new here.\u00a0 Both new and renewing.\n\nIt\u2019s time for some major work on our buildings, which date from the 1920\u2019s and 30\u2019s.\u00a0 Some crucial work.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t have enough money.\u00a0 I feel myself cringing to put it so baldly.\u00a0 And my ESP is picking up a lot of cringe in the chapel here this morning. (Is this appropriate?\u00a0 Is a taboo being broken?)\u00a0 But, cringe or not, you\u2019ll hear more about this as time goes on.\u00a0 The capital campaign is not public yet, but it\u2019s not a secret, either.\u00a0 It\u2019s in what is called \u201cthe quiet phase.\u201d\n\nWe are in a position of need\u2014and that is new to us.\u00a0 And renewing. \u00a0Even as we plan the renovation of our buildings, we are beginning to experience our own renovation.\u00a0 The renewing of our faith, the renewing of our self-understanding.\u00a0 The renewing of our sense of connectedness to the wider church.\u00a0 The renovation of our sense of purpose, our mission.\n\nTo put it crassly, there\u2019s nothing like needing money to drive home the fact of our dependence on others.\u00a0 Self-sufficiency is a delusion, a dangerous delusion.\u00a0 We are all, to a degree, interdependent.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fact of life.\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 And truth sets us free.\u00a0 Truth opens the door to grace.\u00a0 Truth opens the door to blessing.\u00a0 Even if we cringe to hear it.\n\nWe \u201cmen of the moment\u201d are finding this particular moment a time of need. That is the truth.\u00a0 And therein lies grace. \u00a0And in this grace lies renewal.\u00a0 This is what \u201cnew creation\u201d means to us just now, at least in part.\u00a0 God is accomplishing our own renewal through this new need.\n\nIn the gospel Jesus sends the seventy out without purse or bag or sandals\u2014and earlier he sent out the twelve with \u201cnothing for the journey\u201d: no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic. I think I\u2019m beginning to understand why he sent them out in such vulnerability.\u00a0 The apostles were not to think of themselves as self-sufficient.\u00a0 In order for them to be effective in their ministry, they themselves needed to understand that they were deeply dependent on the communities they served.\n\nOr, more precisely, interdependent.\u00a0 The communities they served needed the apostles\u2019 message; and the apostles needed the material support of the communities they served.\u00a0 There was to be no condescension born of delusions of self-sufficiency, but a deepening awareness of mutual need born of vulnerability.\u00a0 In this way, those who helped the apostles would then become vital partners in their mission.\u00a0 A synergy of mutual need and mutual support was created.\n\nWe \u201cmen of the moment\u201d have plenty of sandals and the equivalent of staffs and bags and purses and food and even some money.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t have what we need to accomplish the mission we feel called to.\n\nBut in our need, in our vulnerability, we\u2019re beginning to see more clearly how the tapestry of our life is woven into the greater tapestry of the Church and the world. \u00a0We are awakening to a more vibrant sense of interconnection with the wider church and the world.\u00a0 This interdependence is new and renewing.\u00a0 It\u2019s how God\u2019s new creation is unfolding in this moment. The real renovation here will be our own.\n\nWe depend on God.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t just depend on God: we depend on you! And that may be the best thing that ever happened to us.\n\nPrint Friendly, PDF & Email\n\nSupport SSJE\n\nPlease support the Brothers work.\n\nClick here to Donate\n\n\n  1. CHRISTINA MCKERROW on November 15, 2017 at 09:00\n\n    Dear Mark:\n    I write again. It is ten years since your sermon first appeared; a few less since I last wrote to you.\n    I think many of us are in a financial squeeze: my monthly income just covers my outgoings, and that isn\u2019t with any fancy frills. That situation is not going to improve as I live longer and could be faced with a placement somewhere I cannot afford. The other day, I received four pieces of mail: three of them were all appeals for money. All worthy. The fourth piece was from my bank outlining changes that are coming.\n    Sometimes, it is not possible to do more than we are already doing. Blessings to all of you. Christina\n\n  2. Anders on September 24, 2013 at 12:17\n\n    When I read the date of the post, I was mistaken to think it would be outdated. Perhaps what makes it the most relevant is your quote from Fr. Benson on being men and women of the present moment who see what\u00b4s happening as things to rejoice in and act upon. Pope Frances recent pronouncements have a similar relevancy of singing a new song, even in the tradition of the old, and it\u00b4s all good.\n\n  3. Christina on September 24, 2013 at 08:53\n\n    Dear Br. Mark:\n    How little I give you. Yes, there is a money order now and again, but I read the daily message from SSJE every morning, print some of them off, reread them. My donation is so little in comparison to the blessings I receive from all of your words.\n    When I go across the road for a coffee (and a scone) a couple of times a week, each occasion costs me nearly seven dollars: How would it be if my coffee money was matched for SSJE?\n\n  4. Jean Ann Schulte on February 25, 2012 at 18:07\n\n    Each of us longs to be needed, to belong. To be invited to help \u2013 to tangibly respond \u2013 to the spiritual gifts and hospitality of the Brothers completes the circle of interconnection. Mark, you and your Brothers are modeling the dignity of interdependence in a world that values individual accomplishment.\n\n  5. Polly Chatfield on February 24, 2012 at 08:00\n\n    I beg to differ, Mark. I think it is the best thing that ever happened to those whom the Brothers go to in their need. The grace of being able to help seems a fathomless blessing. Thank you so much for asking.\n\n  6. andy on February 24, 2012 at 07:54\n\n    These Sermons give me help for talk at a men homeless hostel here on the ILSE OF WIGHT ENGLAND thank you so much and GOD BLESS YOU IN ALL YOU DO FOR HIM ANDY\n\nLeave a Comment",

        "text":"I know, I know. The blog title sounds like an overstatement. Maybe\u2014but it\u2019s at least the best essay I\u2019ve read on the subject.\n\nWritten by Vern Poythress and published in JETS in 1996, it\u2019s called \u201cModern Spiritual Gifts as Analogous to Apostolic Gifts: Affirming Extraordinary Works of the Spirit.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thesis:\n\nI maintain that modern spiritual gifts are analogous to but not identical with the divinely authoritative gifts exercised by the apostles. Since there is no strict identity, apostolic teaching and the biblical canon have exclusive divine authority. On the other hand, since there is analogy, modern spiritual gifts are still genuine and useful to the church. Hence, there is a middle way between blanket approval and blanket rejection of modern charismatic gifts.\n\nOn prophecy he says, \u201cIf charismatics and noncharismatics could agree on these points, I think that the debate on modern spiritual gifts would be largely over.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an outline of the sections:\n\n  1. Christocentricity of gifts\n  2. A pyramid of giftedness\n  3. Awareness of basis for words and action\n  4. Distinctive focuses for content\n  5. The question of modern charismatic gifts\n  6. Circumstantial content received through nondiscursive processes\n  7. Predictions\n  8. Commands\n  9. Welcoming spiritual gifts\n  10. The debate about the cessation of prophecy\n  11. Modern speaking in tongues\n  12. Historical accounts of extraordinary events\n\nThe following diagram might not make a lot of sense without reading the essay, but it does a helpful job of pulling together the way in which Dr. Poythress sees spiritual gifts functioning in biblical times and today:\n\nPrint Friendly\n\n\n31 thoughts on \u201cThe Best Essay Ever Written on Spiritual Gifts Today\u201d\n\n  1. Justin,\n\n    I agree with your title with the same caveat; the best I have read. Well worth the read!\n\n\n  2. Bill Higley says:\n\n    Thanks for pointing us to this article Justin, very informative and thoughtful.\n\n    Bill H.\n\n  3. Brad says:\n\n    \u201cIf charismatics and noncharismatics could agree on these points, I think that the debate on modern spiritual gifts would be largely over.\u201d\n\n    Agreed, but asking both sides to fuse into a \u201cmiddle way\u201d on this issue seems pretty optimistic. God can do anything, but it would take a miracle to bring both sides together \u2013 please forgive the pun.\n\n\n  4. Bruce Russell says:\n\n    The Charismatic gifts pointed the church to the authorized apostolic witness and gave supernatural punctuation to the end of the Torah age and beginning of the New Covenant. Any resumption or claimed resumption of Charismatic gifts diminishes the authority and influence of the apostolic witness and brings confusion to the church. This middle way is an attempt to minimize the confusion. Eliminate it completely by removing the rock music induced mysticism which is the Charismatic movement.\n\n    1. J.Clark says:\n\n      This seems rather simple. Could you give some Biblical support that the charismatic gifts were a signal of the end of the Torah age and the beginning of the new covenant? And could you show us what date or with what person it ended? I don\u2019t remember that verse.\n\n      1. Bruce Russell says:\n\n        J. Clark:\n\n        Breaking down the wall of separation was a huge change for the people of God.\n\n        The renting of the veil, the resurrection, Pentecost, the destruction of Jerusalem, these were historical facts. The calling of the Jews and Gentiles to the New Covenant in the church required similar supernatural signs to the host generation.\n\n        Supposed modern Charismatic signs divert people from the treasures revealed in the Greek New Testament and to the unique unrepeatable redemptive history of the 1st century.\n\n        1. J.Clark says:\n\n          I actually agree with everything you say here. But what I don\u2019t see is any evidence that God commanded some kind of stoppage. The Supernatural didn\u2019t stop after the red sea. And your argument is actually hitting on the very reason why gifts still exist: to point to the glorious and powerful working of Jesus Christ in the life of all those who believe. But if we take the argument as you leave it then we are left with nothing. Have not Christians used the church, offering, positions, theology, doctrine, preaching, teaching,etc. in a way that diminished the Glory of God? So do those cease as well? And after all, no history is repeatable but God\u2019s Spirit comes as it wills on every generation. So the charismatic gifts exist to point to the glorious riches in Christ Jesus.\n\n          1. Bruce Russell says:\n\n            J. Clark:\n\n            Unfortunately, the put the focus on the person exercising them, who gets outsized influence from the gullible and naive who believe he is a divine channel. These gifts are self-centric and non-falsifiable, until it\u2019s too late.\n\n\n    2. Brad says:\n\n      \u201cEliminate it completely by removing the rock music induced mysticism which is the Charismatic movement.\u201d\n\n      See what I mean? As long as arguments like this one is attached to the debate, there is simply no hope for any middle way. This is not to slam Bruce\u2019s view, but to point out the obvious..,that the division on both sides is much deeper than Mr.Poythress intimates in his essay.\n\n\n  5. sae says:\n\n    I have always wondered\u2013if tongues today are not from God, where are they from? Just our imagination, Satan, or ???? And why do certain churches have all the tongues speakers and some have none? You would think if tongues were from God and were active today, at least someone in a non-tongue megachurch, for example, would be speaking them.\n\n    1. J.Clark says:\n\n      I think there are many who do speak in tongues (other denominations, megachurches, etc.) but believe that many charismatics apply it wrongly.\n\n  6. Michael says:\n\n    How does a charismatic who believes in the continuation of prophecy (or tongues) hold to sola scriptura?\n\n    - If prophecy and tongues add to scripture, then you cannot hold to sola scriptura.\n    - If prophecy and tongues do not add to scripture, hence adding no new revelation from God, then they are unnecessary and just add confusion.\n\n    1. @ J.T.\n\n      Spon on. This is a great article and one that helped me develop a better understanding of subordiante gifts. Cheers, Jesse\n\n    2. @ Michael\n\n      Great question. I believe the Scriptures hold-up a subordinate \u201crevelation\u201d to that of the Scripture without conflict.\n\n      You can check this post out to see what I\u2019m saying http:\/\/reformedandreforming.org\/2009\/12\/05\/reformed-continuationist-why-the-gift-of-prophecy-does-not-undermine-the-authority-of-the-bible\/\n\n      Cheers, Jesse\n\n    3. Justin Taylor says:\n\n\n      The article attempts to answer this question.\n\n\n    4. J.Clark says:\n\n      Yet the New Testament figures held to the scriptures and practiced such gifts. Maybe there is a misunderstanding of what the gifts are for? Namely, that tongues and prophecy do not add to the scriptures but affirm them.\n\n    5. Kim Noble says:\n\n      Hi Michael\u2013excellent questions and they address, precisely, some of the most basic, yet crucial, questions I have regarding the charismatic movement. Even under the guise of \u201caffirmation\u201d vs. \u201caddition\u201d, I still take issue with some of these exact definitions.\n\n      I can\u2019t speak authoritatively, on an academic level, but I can speak experientially (for what it\u2019s worth) from church and (big, regional) church camps about the environment. I was explicitly taught affirmation, but the tones of addition were there. They were adding to Scriptural commands and commentary on life (not just generally, but specific to people\u2019s current needs, as well) through perceived prophecy, tongues and miracles. \u201cGod saith this\u201d and \u201c\u2026 thus saith the Lord.\u201d or \u201cGod told me\u2026\u201d were common. Words spoken generally to the congregation and\/or specifically to someone\u2019s life situation(s) vs. the Scriptures containing the authority and sufficiently\/completely \u201cequipping for every good work.\u201d (cf. II Tim. 3:16-17)\n\n      I don\u2019t want to be pegged as the \u201canti\u201d Charismatic. I\u2019m so thankful for many who are in the movement who have personally fed me, spiritually, some deep, theological truths. But I also recognize that many who are in the movement can and are confused about exactly whose spoken authority they should be following, as if there\u2019s some sort of authoritative pyramid.\n\n      I also know, experientially, confusion from trying to reconcile my own lack of faith with God\u2019s gift of faith\u2013which one is more powerful concerning specific situations in my life starting with salvation? The answer: With man everything! is impossible, but with God nothing! is impossible. (my own exclamation!) :) God will finish what He started.\n\n      IMHO, trying to find a middle ground to appease both sides is a slippery slope away from Sola Scriptura.\n\n      Michael\u2013excellent questions and, IMO, address the crux of some challenges a Charismatic might face, at least based on my experience. :)\n\n  7. This is great stuff. With regard to cessation\/continuation, I\u2019ve come to consider both inadequate and I would tend to agree with Dr. Poythress. There are cessationists who deny as valid any nondiscursive spiritual gifts and continuationists who accept nondiscursive spiritual gifts today as being inspired. Both need to be tempered. God has closed his canon, but does wonderful things like appear to people directly in closed countries to bring his people to faith and cause people to know languages that they have not studied. One lady in my church in doing missions in South America was suddenly functionally fluent in Spanish and one South American lady we were working with was suddenly functionally fluent in English. Poof \u2013 Just like that.\n\n    The only thing that makes me a little cautious about Dr. Poythress\u2019 observations is the distinction between level 3 and level 4. I don\u2019t think he means to say that we need super-spiritual human intermediaries between God and ordinary people... (truncated)",

        "text":"In response to:\n\nWithout God from the September 25, 2008 issue\n\nTo the Editors:\n\nIt\u2019s depressing to see a misunderstanding of the eleventh- and early-twelfth-century Sufi philosopher Abu Hamid al-Ghazali play such a prominent role in Professor Steven Weinberg\u2019s essay \u201cWithout God\u201d [NYR, September 25]. The quoted discussion of cotton burning occurs in Problem XVII of al-Ghazali\u2019s Incoherence of the Philosophers. Al-Ghazali simply makes the same point as Hume in explaining that there is no logical necessity to, or \u201cdemonstrative proof\u201d of, causality. According to al-Ghazali, even God has no power over the \u201cImpossible\u201d (e.g., the affirmation of something and its denial), but \u201cwhat is not impossible is within power.\u201d We do not normally think that Hume\u2019s reflections on the foundations for our \u201cpresupposition\u201d of causation in any way undermined science. I\u2019m not aware of anything in al-Ghazali, any more than in Hume, that suggested we approach the world without that \u201cpresupposition.\u201d\n\nContrary to Professor Weinberg\u2019s understanding, al-Ghazali did believe that \u201claws of nature could [be] reconciled with Islam.\u201d In the same Incoherence of the Philosophers al-Ghazali writes (in Preface Two of the 1963 English translation by S.A. Kamali): \u201cIf you tell a man who has studied these things [natural laws]\u2026that these things are contrary to religion, your assertion will shake his belief in religion, not in these things.\u201d Just before that, al-Ghazali explains, \u201cHe who thinks that it is his religious duty to disbelieve such things is really unjust to religion, and weakens its cause.\u201d\n\nAs he explained in his Alchemy of Happiness, al-Ghazali viewed the physicist as \u201clike an ant who, crawling on a sheet of paper and observing black letters spreading over it, should refer the cause to the pen alone.\u201d Because al-Ghazali believed there was a God behind the laws of nature did not mean he denied the existence of those laws, nor in any way discouraged their exploration, any more than he would deny there was writing on the sheet of paper traversed by the ant.\n\nReaders interested in al-Ghazali\u2019s views on causality can find a useful article, with citations to al-Ghazali\u2019s writings, at\n\nBob Lockner\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nTo the Editors:\n\nProfessor Weinberg\u2019s belief, based on his own anecdotal evidence, is that religion has become significantly less important in the lives of Americans, and that science has played a significant part in this change. I would like to suggest that he review statistical studies of this phenomenon (e.g., those summarized in Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide by Professors Pippa Norris of Harvard and Ronald Inglehart of Michigan). These studies, which are designed to eliminate public opinion bias, show rather convincingly that although religion has become relatively less important in the lives of people in Western Europe and Eastern Asia, religion is of increasing importance to Americans.\n\nAmericans are very different in their beliefs from most in the postindustrial world but compare most closely with the citizens of countries in South America and the Middle East (see Fig. 10.2, p. 226, in Sacred and Secular ). The importance of these cultural differences between peoples around the world is substantial, including, as Weinberg mentions, the potential for great harm between those of different beliefs. In 2009 at the University of Michigan, a graduate fellowship in sociology will begin with its focus being the study of such social phenomena.\n\nNorman Bodine\n\nFounder Bodine Graduate Fellowship in Sociology University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Michigan\n\nTo the Editors:\n\n\u2026Professor Weinberg\u2019s peroration is a stoic account, self-aggrandizing as all such accounts must be, about the great struggles and trials that must be borne by we happy few, we band of brothers, who have learned to live without God. (Friedrich Nietzsche, that great theologian malgr lui, knew better: the so-called death of God is a much more cataclysmic event than we have yet come to understand.)\n\nHe includes a greatly exaggerated report of the demise of religious poetry, buttressed by the wholly unsubstantiated claim that \u201clittle English-language poetry written in the past few decades owes anything to belief in God.\u201d In addition to sweeping away many fine poets (Geoffrey Hill, David Middleton, Janet Morley, Micheal O\u2019Siadhail, Rowan Williams), this time frame insulates itself from critique; since when is twenty years long enough to determine which poetry is \u201cgreat\u201d? Moreover, science was already well in the ascendancy before Eliot, Auden, and R.S. Thomas came along, yet somehow they managed to soldier on.\n\nThe final straw is Weinberg\u2019s truly laughable claim that \u201cnone of [Shakespeare\u2019s] work seems to me to show the slightest hint of serious religious inspiration\u201d\u2014a notion that would provoke derision from even the most ardently secular Shakespeare scholar. Apparently, Professor Weinberg\u2019s wholesale lack of serious engagement with theology has blinded him not only to the biblical allusions that dominate the plays, but also to their consistent focus on intensely theological themes such as the quality of mercy, the hollowness of revenge, and the absolute necessity of forgiveness\u2014all filtered through a specifically Christian lens.\n\n\nBut at least Weinberg counsels the use of humor, so I will add that my own thoughtful essay on \u201cThe Phoolishness of Physics\u201d will surely appear in these pages shortly.\n\nDavid S. Cunningham\n\nProfessor of Religion Hope College Holland, Michigan\n\nTo the Editors:\n\nWhen Steven Weinberg speaks of a \u201cwidespread weakening of religious belief\u201d he seems to focus on belief in the supernatural. While such traditional religious belief exists today, I appreciate his admission that \u201cfor some there is also a sort of spirituality that Emerson wrote about,\u201d which Weinberg himself claims not to understand. Albeit that acknowledgment, he still wonders \u201chow long religion can last without a core belief in the supernatural.\u201d\n\nWhat needs to be affirmed is that there is a basic and ongoing quest of the human spirit, directed beyond itself, that is not weakening, let alone dying out. Reinhold Niebuhr alluded to it when he wrote that \u201cthe essential homelessness of the human spirit is the ground of all religion.\u201d1 Augustine of Hippo referred to it in The Confessions when he acknowledged that \u201cthe heart of man is restless until it finds rest in Thee.\u201d\n\nRather than emphasizing a diminishing of belief in the facts about God, as does Weinberg, I would stress, out of my long-term experience as a pastor, that for many people today, within and outside our churches, the ongoing searching nature of the human spirit continues to be vital and strong. Indeed, it frequently involves the discovery that there is something deeply personal at the heart of existence, a realm of the spirit that is gracious. I believe William James was alluding to this realm of the spirit when he wrote: \u201cBeyond each man and in a fashion continuous with him, there exists a larger power which is friendly to him and to his ideals.\u201d2\n\nEdward Castner\n\nPresbyterian Minister (retired)\n\nWallingford, Connecticut\n\nTo the Editors:\n\nSteven Weinberg\u2019s stirring article\u2014\u201cWithout God \u2014may provide the clue to what I have been searching for and he wishes to sponsor: how to live without God, and without despair or cynicism.\n\nHis arguments about the usual objections to atheism\u2014unexplained phenomena, human exceptionalism, Islamic rejection of laws that limit God, and the nature of authority\u2014are thoughtful and, by my lights, sound. He ends his piece by calling on human beings to buoy their courage and face the reality that there is nothing after death, which, writes Weinberg, \u201c\u2026makes cowards of us all.\u201d\n\nDoes it? Must it? As an aging Episcopal priest, who has led worship and suffered many slings and arrows for questioning ancient authority, I not only do not fear the nothing of death, but largely, I think, thanks to being immersed in ancient texts and rituals that, as many now understand, were not about facts, nor about an alternative reality, but about the wonder of finding ourselves in this unlikely existence, have become satisfied, even grateful, for being here for this rich moment in cosmic history.\n\nThere was an infinity before these cells came together to offer this consciousness a\u00c2\u00a0ride nearly seventy years ago, and soon entropy will provide for them to disassemble this consciousness for at least another eternity.\n\nSadness? Yes. I find just about every major shift in my reality can evoke sadness. Would I wish this consciousness would go on forever? I don\u2019t think so. I am grateful to have grown from infancy to childhood, childhood to adolescence, adolescence to adulthood, adulthood to old age. Like most I hope I may die before my consciousness succumbs to a senescence that robs me of my enthusiasm for all this.\n\nReligion has had as much as anything to do with the grotesque human sense that we are different, not a part of everything else, not subject to the same forces. Once I understood myself as an odds-against result of a chance encounter between a madly swimming sperm and an egg, the rest has seemed like footnote.\n\nThe most religious I can imagine is the gratitude (Eucharist) I feel for this lucky happening. My religion has become learning to pay attention to the endless details as they unfold, and to try, best I can, to show in my life how thrilled I am to have been here. And, as Mary Oliver put it, \u201c\u2026when the time comes to let it go, to let it go.\u201d\n\nReverend Blayney Colmore\n\nJacksonville, Vermont\n\nSteven Weinberg replies:\n\nI am grateful to the many readers who sent letters commenting on my article, either to these pages or directly to me.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with Mr. Lockner about the role of the Sufi philosopher al-Ghazali in the history of Islamic science. For one thing, the points regarding causality made by al-Ghazali and David Hume were very different. Al-Ghazali\u2019s argument in refuting \u201che who woul... (truncated)",
