        "text":"School Options Made Easier for Students\u00a0\n\nDistrict empowers families to make informed choices\n\nSeptember 30, 2013\n\nCPS prides itself on offering students a variety of academic programs to meet their specific needs. To help families identify which schools might be a good fit for their children, and to help them more easily navigate the application process, the District has created a host of new tools to supplement its existing slate of resources.\n\n\nThe application process for the 2014-15 school year begins on October 1. This process encompasses elementary magnet and selective enrollment schools, as well as several high school options, including magnet, selective enrollment, international baccalaureate (IB), military academies and career and technical education programs.\n\n\n\u201cOur goal as a District is to empower families to make informed decisions about their children\u2019s unique academic needs and to help them easily navigate this process,\u201d said CPS CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett. \u201cI strongly encourage families to take advantage of our helpful resources as they begin to explore our high-quality school and academic program offerings.\u201d\n\n\nStudents applying to 9th-grade can now log on to to schedule their own selective enrollment exams and magnet school auditions. They can also use this system to arrange the information sessions that are required by STEM and IB schools and military academies. Students interested in selective enrollment high schools are encouraged to schedule their exams early, as it may help them make informed choices about where to apply.\n\n\n\u201cSelecting early test dates can be beneficial for families,\u201d said Katie Ellis, Executive Director of CPS\u2019 Office of Access & Enrollment. \u201cStudents who schedule test dates in November and December will receive their results prior to the application deadline, which will help them narrow down their options for next year.\u201d\n\n\nThis self-scheduling system is a departure from previous years when test dates were assigned to students at random. The new system will permit students to choose times and locations that work in their calendars, even allowing for the changing of appointments when necessary.\n\n\nIn order to access this system, students MUST have a previously assigned Personal Identification Number (PIN). These were assigned by CPS to all eighth graders in a letter that also listed the programs to which each student is eligible to apply for the 2014-15 school year. This list was based on final grades and standardized test scores from each student\u2019s seventh grade year. All eighth graders are also being provided with a physical copy of the CPS High School Guide, which provides detailed information about all high school options that are available within the District.\n\n\nTo view the Self-Schedule Information Video, which provides a step-by-step guide to accessing the new system, click\n\n\nOther Helpful Resources\n\n  \u2022 The Office of Access & Enrollment (OAE) Website \u2013 Visit for general information about CPS schools and programs. For specific information on the application process, as well as selection and notification guidelines, click on the tab marked Resources.\n  \u2022 Up-to-Date Tier Data \u2013 Families applying to selective enrollment or magnet schools may want to use their home address to determine their respective tiers. This information is available at\n  \u2022 Option Guides \u2013 The District offers families comprehensive information on the academic programs available throughout CPS. Both the Options for Knowledge elementary school guide and the searchable high school directory are available in English and Spanish, and can be accessed by visiting Print copies can be obtained at any school, or by visiting CPS Central Office at 125 S. Clark Street.\n\n\nFamilies with additional questions are encouraged to call the CPS Office of Access & Enrollment at (773) 553-2060.\n\n\nPage Last Modified on Monday, September 30, 2013",

        "text":"The U.S. Goes to War \u2013 and the War Comes to Iowa\n\nWe are commemorating the 70th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War Two\u00a0by highlighting some items \u00a0in our collections relating to this event.\n\nNile C. Kinnick, Jr. was a University of Iowa student in 1939. The war began in Europe the same fall season when Kinnick and the UI \u201cIron Men\u201d once again put Iowa on the nation\u2019s sports map with their football victories. By the end of November, the team stood at 6-1-1, and Kinnick had won most major football\u00a0awards in the country. Kinnick traveled to New York City, where on December 6, 1939 he accepted the Heisman Memorial Trophy Award at the Downtown Athletic Club.\n\nAlready before his acceptance speech, Kinnick had earned the high praise of sports writers\u00a0and journalists across the country, some of who had called him \u201cThe Cornbelt Comet.\u201d\u00a0Yet even as he was achieving unprecedented fame at such a young age, Kinnick was aware of the terrible conflict\u00a0unfolding in Europe, and the challenge it posed to Americans. In his brief acceptance speech, he devoted the last 3 sentences to taking a position on World War Two.\n\n\nKinnick Heisman acceptance speech\n\nNile Kinnick's Heisman Trophy acceptance speech, December 6, 1939, New York City Downtown Athletic Club.\n\n\nKinnick\u2019s thoughtful words show an appreciation of football as a physical tournament, peaceful conflict resolution through a contact sport. In preferring the Heisman to the famous French war decoration, he echoed an independent-minded version of U.S. isolationism, and an appreciation of the values of his American society.\n\nKinnick graduated from the University of Iowa in 1940 with a BA in Commerce, and turned down some NFL offers to go to law school. As the global conflict unfolded, Kinnick\u2019s view of U.S. involvement in the war also changed. In 1941 he enlisted in the Navy Air Corps Reserve. He was called to active duty just three days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor \u2013 on December 10, 1941. Nile Clarke Kinnick, Jr. died on June 2, 1943, after his plane developed mechanical difficulties and was ditched in the Gulf of Paria.\n\nThe Papers of Nile C. Kinnick, Jr. are one of the most treasured collections of The University of Iowa Special Collections. Please see the online description of their contents here:",

        "text":"When it comes to the environment, education affects our actions\n\n21 March 2011\n\nThe more highly educated are more likely to display their environmental credentials through what they buy rather than with actions such as turning off lights, according to findings from Understanding Society, the world\u2019s largest household panel survey, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and managed by the Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex.\n\nThe first set of findings from the survey are based on data from more than 22,000 individuals and show that people with degrees are 25 per cent more likely, on average, than people with no education qualifications to adopt pro-environmental behaviours, at least in terms of paying more for environmentally-friendly products. However, they are less likely to turn off the TV overnight or to use public transport.\n\nOverall the survey, which will follow 40,000 UK households over many years, found that 60 per cent\u00a0of people believed that a major environmental disaster is pending if things continue on their current course, and just over half the respondents (53 per cent) say they 'do quite a few things that are environmentally friendly' or are 'environmentally friendly in most things or everything' they do.\n\nNonetheless, people\u2019s willingness to behave in an environmentally-friendly way comes with conditions as 59 per cent\u00a0of those surveyed agreed that 'any changes I make to help the environment need to fit in with my lifestyle' and just half (50 per cent) would be prepared to pay more for environmentally friendly products.\n\nProfessor Peter Lynn at the Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER) which manages Understanding Society at the University of Essex, said: \"These findings offer an interesting suggestion that more highly-educated people may be more willing to take environmentally-motivated principled actions such as buying recycled paper products or avoiding the purchase of over-packaged products and yet are less willing than others to take relatively small actions that may be more of a personal inconvenience.\"\n\nThe survey found that:\n\n  \u2022 women are more likely than men to adopt pro-environmental behaviours, for example they are 4per cent\u00a0more likely, on average, to be willing to pay more for environmentally-friendly products;\n\n  \u2022 the presence of dependent children in the household is associated with a lower willingness to pay more for environmentally friendly products;\n\n  \u2022 employed people seem less likely to adopt pro-environmental behaviours\u00a0- especially by putting on more clothes when cold and reducing the frequency of flights\u00a0- than people who are outside the labour market.\n\nUnderstanding Society also reveals that a significant minority have a defeatist attitude towards combating climate change.\u00a0 One in five (21 per cent) think that it is too late to do anything about climate change and nearly a third (29 per cent) believe it is not worth Britain trying to combat climate change, because other countries will just cancel out what we do.\n\nProfessor Lynn added: \"These initial findings suggest that people\u2019s behaviour is motivated by considerations other than environmental concern such as income and personal resources. These motivations need to be better understood if policymakers and civil society organisations looking to change people\u2019s behaviours are to make any genuine headway. There clearly remains across all sections of society a considerable reluctance to take part in environmentally-friendly behaviour that has a personal cost, even though the importance of doing so is recognised by the majority of people.\"\n\nFor further information contact\n\nESRC Press Office:\n\nNotes for editors\n\n  1. About the researcher: Peter Lynn is Professor of Survey Methodology at the Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER). His research interests lie in all areas of quantitative survey methodology.\n\n  2. The findings above are taken from Chapter 12 of 'Understanding Society: Early findings from the first wave of the UK\u2019s household longitudinal study'. Chapter 12 'Environmental Attitudes and Behaviour: who cares about climate change?' by Peter Lynn and Simonetta Longhi analyses the questions asked about environmental behaviour and identifies some of the socio-demographics characteristics associated with these behaviours.\n\n  3. Understanding Society is a world leading study of the socio-economic circumstances in 40,000 British households. The study allows for deeper analysis of a wide range of sections of the population as they respond to regional, national and international change. Understanding Society will greatly enhance our insight into the pathways that influence peoples longer term occupational trajectories; their health and wellbeing, their financial circumstances and personal relationships. Understanding Society also breaks new ground with its interdisciplinary focus. The study will capture biomedical data on 20,000 participants and place this alongside rich social histories, helping us weigh the extent to which people's environment influences their health.\n\n  4. Understanding Society has been commissioned by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). The Research Team is led by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex. The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) delivers the Study.\n\n  5. The ESRC have contributed \u00a327 million towards the funding of Understanding Society, and have successfully secured a total of \u00a319.4 million from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Large Facilities Capital Fund. A further \u00a32.61 million has been secured from a consortium of Government Departments. This funding will support the first five waves of the study until 2015. It is envisaged that the study will continue for up to 20 years.\n\n  6. The ESRC is the UK's largest organisation for funding research on economic and social issues. It supports independent, high quality research which has an impact on business, the public sector and the third sector. The ESRC\u2019s total budget for 2010\/11 is \u00a3218 million. At any one time the ESRC supports over 4,000 researchers and postgraduate students in academic institutions and independent research institutes.",

        "text":"NCCAS is awarded National Endowment for the Arts grant\n\nJuly 3, 2013\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Acting Chairman Joan Shigekawa has announced that the State Education Agency Directors of Arts Education, on behalf of the National Coalition for Core Arts Standards (NCCAS), is one of 817 nonprofit organizations nationwide to receive an NEA Art Works grant. NCCAS has been awarded a $30,000 grant to support the convening of a national Artist Advisory Council at the August 1-5 meeting of the NCCAS writing teams and leadership.\n\nThe recommended NEA grants total $26.3 million and span thirteen artistic disciplines and fields. Applications were reviewed by panels of outside experts convened by NEA staff, and each project was judged on its artistic merit.\n\nActing Chairman Shigekawa said, \u201cThe National Endowment for the Arts is proud to support these exciting and diverse arts projects that will take place throughout the United States. Whether it is through a focus on education, engagement, or innovation, these projects all contribute to vibrant communities and memorable opportunities for the public to engage with the arts.\u201d\n\nNCCAS, a coalition of eight national arts and education organizations and media arts representatives, is writing the new, voluntary arts standards in dance, media arts, music, theatre, and visual arts scheduled for release in 2014. The theatre standards are being created by representatives from the Educational Theatre Association and the American Alliance for Theatre and Education. Artists representing each of the five arts disciplines will attend the August meeting, serving in an advisory capacity for the writing teams.\n\nEdTA Executive Director Julie Woffington called the NEA grant a strong affirmation of the new arts education standards\u2019 value. \u201cAs an NCCAS leadership organization, EdTA has worked hard to reach out to our members and others in the theatre education community to ensure there is buy-in to these new standards. Funding from a public granting agency like the Endowment validates their worth in a broader national arts and education context.\u201d\n\nWoffington also said she is proud that EdTA has secured a commitment from playwright Jim Leonard, Jr. to serve as theatre\u2019s representative on the project\u2019s Arts Advisory Council. \u201cLeonard is a well-respected playwright and screenwriter whose work is widely produced by schools throughout the country. We\u2019re grateful and thrilled that he has agreed to serve in this capacity.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s plays include Anatomy of Gray, The Diviners, And They Dance Real Slow in Jackson, and Crow and Weasel. He has been awarded three NEA Fellowships, a New York Villager Award, the Midland Writers Award, the Samuel French Best New Play Award, and the Dramatists Guild Award. He co-wrote the screenplay for Mira Nair\u2019s award-winning film My Own Country. Leonard has created and produced several television series including Close to Home (CBS), Skin (Fox), and Thieves (ABC); and he wrote and produced Dexter (Showtime) and The Closer (TNT). He is currently a writer-producer for Major Crimes (TNT). Leonard also serves on the boards of the New Harmony Project and Circle X Theatre.\n\nFor the most up-to-date information about the standards project, visit the NCCAS website.",
