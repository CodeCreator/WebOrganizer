        "text":"School Options Made Easier for Students\u00a0\n\nDistrict empowers families to make informed choices\n\nSeptember 30, 2013\n\nCPS prides itself on offering students a variety of academic programs to meet their specific needs. To help families identify which schools might be a good fit for their children, and to help them more easily navigate the application process, the District has created a host of new tools to supplement its existing slate of resources.\n\n\nThe application process for the 2014-15 school year begins on October 1. This process encompasses elementary magnet and selective enrollment schools, as well as several high school options, including magnet, selective enrollment, international baccalaureate (IB), military academies and career and technical education programs.\n\n\n\u201cOur goal as a District is to empower families to make informed decisions about their children\u2019s unique academic needs and to help them easily navigate this process,\u201d said CPS CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett. \u201cI strongly encourage families to take advantage of our helpful resources as they begin to explore our high-quality school and academic program offerings.\u201d\n\n\nStudents applying to 9th-grade can now log on to to schedule their own selective enrollment exams and magnet school auditions. They can also use this system to arrange the information sessions that are required by STEM and IB schools and military academies. Students interested in selective enrollment high schools are encouraged to schedule their exams early, as it may help them make informed choices about where to apply.\n\n\n\u201cSelecting early test dates can be beneficial for families,\u201d said Katie Ellis, Executive Director of CPS\u2019 Office of Access & Enrollment. \u201cStudents who schedule test dates in November and December will receive their results prior to the application deadline, which will help them narrow down their options for next year.\u201d\n\n\nThis self-scheduling system is a departure from previous years when test dates were assigned to students at random. The new system will permit students to choose times and locations that work in their calendars, even allowing for the changing of appointments when necessary.\n\n\nIn order to access this system, students MUST have a previously assigned Personal Identification Number (PIN). These were assigned by CPS to all eighth graders in a letter that also listed the programs to which each student is eligible to apply for the 2014-15 school year. This list was based on final grades and standardized test scores from each student\u2019s seventh grade year. All eighth graders are also being provided with a physical copy of the CPS High School Guide, which provides detailed information about all high school options that are available within the District.\n\n\nTo view the Self-Schedule Information Video, which provides a step-by-step guide to accessing the new system, click\n\n\nOther Helpful Resources\n\n  \u2022 The Office of Access & Enrollment (OAE) Website \u2013 Visit for general information about CPS schools and programs. For specific information on the application process, as well as selection and notification guidelines, click on the tab marked Resources.\n  \u2022 Up-to-Date Tier Data \u2013 Families applying to selective enrollment or magnet schools may want to use their home address to determine their respective tiers. This information is available at\n  \u2022 Option Guides \u2013 The District offers families comprehensive information on the academic programs available throughout CPS. Both the Options for Knowledge elementary school guide and the searchable high school directory are available in English and Spanish, and can be accessed by visiting Print copies can be obtained at any school, or by visiting CPS Central Office at 125 S.

        "text":"Cable Preservation Project Set for the Delaware Memorial Bridge\nInstallation Work Expected through December 2017\n\n(New Castle, DE) Today, Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) officials announced the award of a contract to preserve and protect its principal asset, the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Under the new contract, the DRBA will install a dehumidification system for the main suspension cables on both structures of the Delaware Memorial Bridge. The work is expected to begin at the end of February, 2016 and continue for nearly two years.\n\nThe Delaware Memorial Bridge is a major transportation link in the north-south corridor between Washington, D.C. and New York City that handles more than 34 million vehicles annually. The Delaware Memorial Bridges main suspension cables are original to each bridge. The New Jersey bound span opened in 1951 while the Delaware bound one was completed in 1968.\n\nAccording to Shoukry Elnahal, Chief Engineer for the DRBA, the new dehumidification system is part of the Authority\u2019s comprehensive capital program designed to preserve and protect the bi-state agency\u2019s transportation infrastructure. \u201cThis state-of-the-art system will extend the life span of our main suspension cables that support the bridge deck of the Delaware Memorial Bridges,\u201d Elnahal said. \u201cThe project involves the fitting of air tight wraps around the main cables, positioning injection and exhaust ports, and installing advanced dehumidification plants inside the anchorages of the two bridges.\u201d\n\nElnahal also noted that the system will be equipped with remote sensors and advanced monitoring systems to insure it is functioning as intended. \u201cThe new dehumidification system is designed to operate as efficiently as possible while keeping the Authority\u2019s long term maintenance requirements to a minimum,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the execution of this contract, multiple lanes on the northbound and the southbound bridges will be closed periodically. While DRBA engineers have designed the project to minimize traffic delays to the extent possible, motorists should expect to experience them from time-to-time.\n\nThe safety of the traveling public, highway contractors on-site, and DRBA employees continue to be the highest priority. Commuters and travelers are urged to be careful and stay alert in and around construction zones, obey all detours and posted speed limits and plan to take a few extra minutes during rush hour periods.\n\nApproximately 25 suspension bridges in the world are equipped with a cable dehumidification system. In 1998, the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan was the first to be equipped with such a system. The Maryland Transportation Authority began installing the first cable dehumidification system in the United States for the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial (Bay) Bridge in 2012. That system was completed last year. The Delaware Memorial Bridge Twin Span will be the second such application in the United States.\n\nAmerican Bridge Company of Coraopolis, Pennsylvania will handle the construction and installation work at a cost of $33.6 million. Formed in 1900, American Bridge Company is a leading provider of bridge construction services worldwide. The company excels at the construction and rehabilitation of cable supported bridges, movable bridges, steel truss bridges, steel and concrete arch bridges, and other complex civil infrastructure projects that benefit from advanced construction engineering skills.\n\nAbout the Delaware River and Bay Authority\nThe DRBA, a bi-state governmental agency created by Compact in 1962, owns and operates the Delaware Memorial Bridge, the Cape May- Lewes Ferry, and the Forts Ferry Crossing. The DRBA also manages corporate and aviation properties through its economic development powers - two airports in New Jersey (Millville Airport and Cape May Airport) and three in Delaware (New Castle Airport, Civil Air Terminal and Delaware Airpark). All DRBA operating revenues are generated through the bridge, ferry and airport facilities. For more information, visit\n\nPDF of Press Release\n\nDMB Tower Aerial",

        "text":"\u00bb Sweet Taste of Success\n\nOne family in Ireland has done an amazing job and raised over 3000 Euros, through their fundraising efforts. We were recently contacted by CdLS mum, Melissa Coleman from County Cork, with a fantastic recipe for fundraising. Melissa has a daughter with CdLS, Tabitha, who turned 5 in February.\n\nShe has a friend, Natalie Keane, who runs a craft Chocolate business with her sister. The company is called Bean & Goose and they make a range of chocolate bars with some incredible flavours. Natalie knew of Tabitha and her condition and kindly offered to donate around 50 large bars of her chocolate to raise money for the Foundation. She wanted nothing for her costs, so all profit would go to us.\n\nBean and Goose Chocolate BarWhen Melissa told us, she asked if we could help with creating an awareness raising band around the hand-packaged bars. Of course, we were delighted to help. One of the flavourings of the donated bars was lavender, in honour of our CdLS colours.\n\nThe bars could only be sold in Ireland, so no shipping costs were incurred but they sold out very, very quickly, making nearly \u20ac300 for us. They also were a very effective way of raising awareness of CdLS, with some informative text about the syndrome and a picture.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, Tabitha\u2019s dad, Liam Coleman managed to have the Foundation nominated as one of the charities supported by the company he works for, Eli Lily, for their Christmas charity day. Based in Kinsale, County Cork, Eli Lily held their fundrasing day in December. They raised a massive \u20ac3,200 for CdLS.\n\nCdLS Christmas CardsIrish Regional Volunteer, Eleanor O\u2019Kelly-Lynch has also had a seasonal scheme to raise funds and awareness. She put together some CdLS-branded Christmas Cards for Irish families. Eleanor says; \u201cThe CdLS Christmas card idea was a great success and we will definitely make them an annual fundraising event, judging by the interest we got. We got 1000 cards printed and could have easily sold another 500. Everyone got behind the idea and families ordered them in multiple packs of ten. Thanks to Jenkinson Logistics for paying full cost on design and print which meant every cent raised went to CdLS Foundation - a real bonus giving us \u00a0a total of \u20ac1080.\u201d\n\nOur huge thanks go to Melissa, Liam and Eleanor. What a sweet way to raise money and awareness for CdLS!",

        "text":"Thomas Moore at 240!\n\n28 June 2019\n\nIn this month's Library blog post\u00a0Harry White, MRIA, Professor of Music, University College Dublin, takes a look at our current exhibition\u00a0Discovering Thomas Moore: Ireland in\u00a0nineteenth-century Europe.\n\n\u2018Where in Germany, even today, would you find three such literary heroes to set beside Lord Byron, Moore and Walter Scott?\u2019, enquired the great German writer and statesman, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1824.\u00a0 For many people, it comes as a surprise to see Thomas Moore in such company, in the front rank of British literary romanticism, because his reputation in the interim has dwindled to a handful of well-beloved songs from the Irish melodies, and not much besides. Moore was in fact an originary and formative presence in the development of European music and letters in the first half of the nineteenth century, and the circulation of his poetry, fiction and lyric verse exerted considerable influence on many composers, including Robert Schumann and Hector Berlioz. Schumann\u2019s setting of the second part of Moore\u2019s Lalla Rookh, \u2018Paradise and the Peri\u2019 (in German translation) and Berlioz\u2019s M\u00e9lodies irlandaises (settings in French translation of Moore\u2019s verse from the Irish melodies) affirm a more general popularity for Moore\u2019s poetry on the continent.\n\n\u00a0Thomas Moore, Paradise and the Peri\u00a0(London, Day & Son, [1860]). Image courtesy of Special Collections & Archives, Queen's University Belfast.\n\nMoore\u2019s long poem \u2014 Lalla Rookh \u2014 became an overnight success on its publication in 1817.\u00a0 The poem relates the journey of Lalla Rookh, an Indian princess, from her homeland\u00a0 to Kashmir for her wedding to the king there.\u00a0 En route she meets a poet who accompanies her and beguiles her with the story of a fallen angel (the Peri) who has to pass several tests in order to gain entry to Paradise.\u00a0Lalla Rookh falls in love with the poet who turns out to be her betrothed in disguise! \u00a0Schumann remarked that the verse was \u2018intended for music, as if from the start\u2019. The poem was part of a vogue for orientalism in Europe and was widely admired and translated.\u00a0\n\nThis year we celebrate the 240th anniversary of Moore\u2019s birth in Dublin on 28 May 1779 with an exhibition at the Academy Library, curated by Dr Sarah McCleave, Senior Musicologist at the School of Arts, English & Languages, Queen\u2019s University of Belfast.\n\nThe materials on display recapture not only Moore\u2019s phenomenal success as a poet and lyricist in Europe, but his often neglected reputation as a novelist, satirist, biographer and historian. In recent years, these aspects of Moore\u2019s intellectual estate have received at least something of their due from literary historians and musicologists, just as Moore\u2019s extraordinary life has been magisterially recovered in Ronan Kelly\u2019s 2008 biography, Bard of Erin[i]. Throughout that life, the very idea of Ireland abides, even in Moore\u2019s imagined orient. Moore\u2019s inventions were assuredly romantic, but they were also grounded in a scientific apprehension of scholarly sources and a lively political awareness of injustice and repression. His instincts as a romantic poet were constantly mediated by an antiquarian appeal to the authority of historical documents, and his brilliance as a biographer (particularly of Lord Edward FitzGerald) was fired by \u2018that time of terror and torture\u2019 which Moore experienced as a young student in Trinity College Dublin, following the failed rebellion of 1798. Throughout his writing career, as many of the items displayed in the exhibition demonstrate, Moore\u2019s sense of responsibility to empirical evidence anchored the flight of his auditory imagination.\n\nThomas Moore.
