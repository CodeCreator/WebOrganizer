This is designed to encourage all employees to obtain annual wellness and fitness checks with their primary medical care provider.\n\n\n    Periodic noise dosimeter readings are performed and documented to ensure that our employees are not overexposed to excessive noise. In those areas where the noise level is above the permissible exposure limit, we have posted the appropriate signage as required by OSHA standards. We also require employees to wear hearing protection, which we provide, as part of their personal protective equipment attire. Our HSE Department provides training regarding the proper use of personal protective equipment, and it is discussed at all pre-shift toolbox meetings.\n\n\n    When necessary, employees are provided personal respirators for use during the course of their duties. Periodic monitoring of workplace air quality is conducted by an outside certified industrial hygienist to prevent the possibility of accidental exposure.\n\n\n    As part of our safety meetings, we provide training regarding Workplace Violence Prevention and Awareness. This enables employees to become familiar with the basic, typical signs of trouble before it escalates.\n\n\n    Our office and administrative staff have been provided with up-to-date office equipment and are required to attend training regularly regarding Ergonomics and Office Safety. Periodic inspections of the office areas are conducted to ensure that all personnel are working in an ergonomically safe manner.\n\n\nOur goal at K&B Industries is to provide a safe and healthful work environment for all employees and contractors while complying with all local, state and federal regulatory agency requirements within the state(s) in which we conduct business. In doing so, we can provide a quality product that meets our customers\u2019 requirements while preserving the health and welfare of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding communities.\n\n\n    K&B conducts safety meetings to help ensure our facilities are safe for K&B employees and contractors. During these meetings, we gather employee feedback to obtain ideas and discuss solutions to issues regarding processes, equipment and\/or procedures.\n\n    Each division conducts daily toolbox meetings prior to the beginning of each shift to ensure that all aspects of the job at hand are discussed with all employees involved in the operation, with a specific focus on any specific hazards. Before starting any non-routine operation, our HSE Department conducts a hazard assessment in conjunction with the division manager and personnel involved. A Job Safety Analysis (JSA) form is completed at the work site to document all steps that could pose a safety hazard. These steps are then communicated to all personnel involved in the operations.\n\n\n    Our HSE Administrator and senior management have designed a training curriculum for all K&B employees specific to their positions. Following the guidelines of OSHA Standard for General Industry, 29 CFR 1910, we conduct training at our facility with an in-house instructor.\n\n    We also provide training to employees who volunteer as on-the-job Lay Responders, as well as their family members; certified American Red Cross training in Basic First Aid; adult and child CPR; and AED. First-aid awareness training is required for all employees and is provided in-house to all personnel regardless of their responder duties.\n\n\n    As part of our continuing effort to improve our safety record and maintain the safe operations of our facilities, we have taken a proactive approach by incorporating the following items into our daily operations:\n\n    \u2022 Employee compliance training requirements\n    \u2022 New hire orientation and facility\/job site hazard awareness\n    \u2022 First Aid, CPR, and AED instruction for the employee and family\n    \u2022 Visitor and Contractor Safety Orientation Program\n    \u2022 On-the-job training and mentorship\n\n    Our corrective and preventive action program promotes a sense of ownership for all employees. This is accomplished through a process by which employees document safety observations on specialized cards, which are collected and reviewed weekly by the HSE Administrator and Senior Management. Implementation of corrective actions and changes to processes and\/or procedures are ensured through continual monitoring and daily safety walkthroughs of the facility. The effectiveness of these changes is documented by the facility HSE Representative and reported accordingly.",

        "text":"Building or planting\n\nFor the safety and reliability of the electric system, we must keep a certain amount of distance around power lines clear of anything that may make contact or near-contact with a power line. This includes buildings and tall-growing trees. Great River Energy works to meet or exceed industry standards, including those outlined in the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Such requirements are designed to keep our electrical system safe and reliable.\n\nYou must call Great River Energy before planting any trees or building any structures in the transmission line right of way. We are required to maintain a proper clearance and we do not want to have to remove your new addition.\n\nHow much of a clearance do you need for safe operation?\n\nGreat River Energy requires a minimum 15-foot clear zone (sometimes more) on both sides of any transmission line, measured from the base of the structure. Transmission lines operate at high enough voltages that actual contact with an object may not be necessary to cause an outage. Additionally, summer temperatures and higher electric use cause lines to sag, sometimes as much as 5 to 10 feet. A tree should never be planted closer than its height at maturity to the edge of the clear zone. For instance, an 18\u2019 tree must be planted at least 18\u2019 from the edge of the clear zone. Learn more in The Right Tree guide.\n\nCan I plant anything in the right of way area?\n\nDO NOT plant any trees in the right of way before talking to Great River Energy. Great River Energy is obligated to maintain proper clearances within the right of way and we do not want to have to remove your new tree.\n\nActivities in the right of way that do not interfere with the safe construction, operation and maintenance of the line are permitted. For example, you can use the land for:\n\n  \u2022 Pastureland\n  \u2022 Farming\n  \u2022 Gardening\n\nCan buildings be built beneath a power line?\n\nGenerally, buildings are not permitted within the right of way for a few reasons:\n\n  \u2022 The building may interfere with access to the line for maintenance and emergency repairs.\n  \u2022 A fire in a building within the easement area could damage the transmission line.\n  \u2022 A building may be closer to a line than electrical codes allow.\n\nAre there any hazards to existing metal buildings after a power line is constructed?\n\nAgain, Great River Energy designs transmission lines to meet or exceed safety codes, including those specified in the National Electrical Safety Code and required by NERC. If you plan to construct, or have constructed, a metal building near a transmission line, contact Great River Energy. If you have concerns as to whether or not a building is properly grounded or need information on proper grounding requirements, contact your local electric utility or Great River Energy.",
