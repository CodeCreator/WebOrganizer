        "text":"Monday, June 8, 2009\n\nLittle Denny--a tale of youth and food\n\nLittle Denny kept sliding off the lunch counter stool. The waitress poured his mom another cup of coffee.\nThe waitress laughed, a snorting giggle.\n\u201cThat's cute\u201d she said, turning to look at Mom, a young woman in her mid twenties who'd peering at a magazine while fidgeting with her food. She slapped her sandwich on her plate and grabbed Denny's arm.\n\u201cShit\u201d she said, her voice a irritated hiss, \u201che's doing this on purpose, the rat-\u201c\n\u201cOwwwwwwwwwwwwWWWWWWW\u201d yelled Denny when she yanked him upright on the stool, forcing into an impossible posture. His face met the edge of the counter half way,\nwhere he could see a history of dried and chipping wads of gum mark the rim like mountain ranges on three-dimensional globes. The hamburger Mom ordered for him sat on its plate in front of him, a mountain of meat and sesame seed buns.\n\u201cNow eat\u201d his mother demanded. Her long finger that had been leafing through the magazine pointed to the plate, looking crooked, shaking, with a long, twisting fingernail curling toward the charred patty as if to drop something from a claw. Denny cringed again.\n\u201cEat\u201d she said again \u201ceat and quit fucking around.\u201d\nThe waitress's smile shrank to a chastised `o' from his bulging , full-cheeked glory, and turned to chores , her own business. She pulled half empty ketchup bottles from a shelf under the counter as Denny reached over the chasm between he and the counter and grabbed the hamburger from the plate. It was the size of a football in both his hands. Squeezing it tight, he raised it to his mouth and then turned his eyes to Mom in order to see if she could see him doing exactly what he was told, a mature boy of 4 and a half!\nMom was sipping her coffee, the sandwich on the plate with two bites out of it, staring at the waitress who was pouring the remains of the ketchup bottles into a single vessel, so to waste not a drop. Denny squeezed the burger so tight that the patty slid from between the buns and hit the floor with a wet slap that sounded like a kiss heard in rowdy cartoons. The phone rang, and when the waitress reached over to grab the line, her arm swept into the bottles and knocked them to the floor. The bottles shattered into a hundred red, bloodless shards. Startled, Mom spilled her coffee.\nLittle Denny fell off the stool.\n\n1 comment:\n\n  1. I question that this is fiction. I saw much the same thing happen last weekend at Famous Weiner Lunch in Hanover, PA. Stop trying to spare the public the harrowing, carnivorial truth.\n\n\nComments are moderated due to spam.

        "text":"From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nMelons (Latin: Maximus Melonus) are a type of fruit that grows in the Caribbean, on islands such as Jamaica and Antigua. Melons are about 30cm in diameter, roughly spherical and weigh approximately 2.5kg.\n\nA melon is a largish fruit not unlike a unripe watermelon. Without melons this world might be as significant as it is today. Melons can be Honeydew, Cantaloupe, Galia or possibly even simultaneous. Melons tend to taste sweet, providing the skin is left unadulterated. Melons are also known to suddenly disappear.\n\nedit The Significance of Melons\n\nWhere would we be today if that student hadn't thrown a melon at George Bush in his speech to the nation? Imagine what would have happened if Germany when it attempted to drop a nuclear bomb on Liverpool in early 1945 had actually put their nuclear bomb prototype in the aircraft instead of a melon by mistake. Well actually it's Liverpool, so it's unfortunate that the Germans fouled up.\n\nedit History\n\nDetermining the exact age of the melon is an uncertain business, given that most melons resemble other fruits. However, with the use of cunning technology, it has been determined that the melon is probably 300-400 million years old. Not a great deal is known about the original melons, though they would have been half the size of modern equivalents.\n\nedit Uses\n\nMelons have been cultivated for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, eating, bowling and as weapons. The taste is reminiscent of a sort of sweetened watermelon taste with extra sweetness and less redness. Without melons, diet would collapse.\n\nPersonal tools",

Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll sign you out. (Before the diner knows what\u2019s happened, the uniformed man behind the counter has hoiked him up by the collar and\u00a0hussled him out the door, where he stands bewildered in the street)\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 Shall I pour\u00a0your wine, madam?\n\n(Female diner leaves her table, throwing the DINER card at the waiter in disgust, and joins the ejected man on the street, where they phone for a taxi and a pizza.\u00a0 Meanwhile, another man has walked into the restuarant, taken his place at a table, and is reading a menu.)\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 Would you like to order, sir?\n\nDiner:\u00a0 Yeah, I\u2019d like the steak please, medium rare.\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 Could you write that down?\n\nDiner:\u00a0 Eh?\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 Could you write that down?\n\nDiner:\u00a0 What the fuck?\u00a0 Can\u2019t you do that?\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 Well,\u00a0no as it happens.\u00a0 You see, I\u2019m a contractor and I\u2019m not authorised to enter the order in the system having first written my own order.\u00a0 In fact,\u00a0I\u2019m not authorised to enter your order in the system at all, but if you speak to\u2026\u00a0\n\nDiner:\u00a0 (shouting)\u00a0 Listen, I couldn\u2019t care less what you\u2019re authorised to do, just go into the kitchen and tell the chef to cook me a steak, medium rare!\u00a0 It really isn\u2019t hard!\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 At once, sir.\u00a0 (scuttles off, muttering under his breath)\n\n(Forty minutes pass)\n\nDiner: (shouting)\u00a0 Waiter!\u00a0 Waiter!\u00a0 Anyone there?\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 Yes sir, I\u2019m here.\u00a0 How can I help?\n\nDiner:\u00a0 My steak?\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 Ah yes, your steak.\u00a0 Coming right up. (The waiter disappears through a door into the kitchen.\u00a0 He returns with what looks like a lump of flattened charcoal on his plate)\n\nDiner:\u00a0 What the hell is this?\u00a0 Is this supposed to be my steak?\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 Certainly, sir.\u00a0 That\u2019s your steak.\n\nDiner:\u00a0 What the hell has happened to it?\u00a0 I asked for medium rare!\u00a0 What\u2019s it been cooked with, a blowtorch?\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 I have no idea.\u00a0 Would you like me ask the chef?\n\nDiner:\u00a0 (raising his voice) Yes I would!\u00a0 Ask him if he knows what medium rare is! (The waiter shuffles off towards the kitchen.\u00a0 He comes back a few minutes later.)\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 No, he hasn\u2019t a clue.\u00a0 He wants to know if you wouldn\u2019t mind helping him, because\u2026\n\nDiner:\u00a0 (shouting) You what?\u00a0 What the fuck?\u00a0 The chef doesn\u2019t know how to cook a steak?\u00a0 Then what\u2019s he doing here? Where did you get him from?\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 I didn\u2019t get him from anywhere, I\u2019m just a contractor.\u00a0 So don\u2019t yell at me.\u00a0 But I heard that he was a car-park attendant in head office and as part of the company policy of moving people into different departments to do different roles, he is here on a six month assignment as head chef.\n\nDiner:\u00a0 A car park attendant?\u00a0 That\u2019s who you have cooking your food back there?\n\nWaiter:\u00a0 Yes, him and a load of contractors.\u00a0 Now I don\u2019t know about all of them, but I knew one back in prison and he\u2026\n\nDiner:\u00a0 Listen, I don\u2019t give\u00a0a shit.\u00a0 I\u2019m starving, just bugger off and let me eat this lump of charcoal.\u00a0 (He picks up a knife and fork and cuts into it.\u00a0 It\u2019s tougher than a Commanche indian\u2019s moccasin.\u00a0 Before he can put anything anywhere near his mouth, Hard-hat comes running back into the room clutching a clipboard.)\n\nHard-hat:\u00a0 Stop!\u00a0 Stop!\u00a0 Stop!
