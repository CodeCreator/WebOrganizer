        "text":"Job Interview Tips\n\nWhile your resume lists your skills and qualifications, how you conduct yourself in the interview is the deciding factor whether you get the job or not. Like an individual in the sales profession, you are selling yourself to people you have just met. To make the interview as effective as possible, you must prepare yourself by using the following tips.\n\n\nLearn as much as you can about the company. Understand the job description and skills and qualifications needed for the job. By knowing these you can compare the skills of your current job with this new position and demonstrate how they tie in together.\n\n\nThink of possible questions your interviewer may ask. Write down answers to each question. Talk in front of a mirror and watch your facial expressions. This way you can watch for signs of doubt and adjust your actions.\n\nEvaluate Past Interviews.\n\nIf you recently had an interview for another job, this can help you get this position. First of all, list what went good during that interview. Then evaluate what could have been better. Maybe there were some questions that were hard to answer. Think about those questions and practice answering them.\n\nDress Appropriately.\n\nPretend that you have the job already and know what the dress code is. Wear similar attire to the interview. For example, if the job requires a suit and tie, wear these and not jeans and a T-shirt.\n\nBe On Time.\n\nWhen you find out where the interview is going to take place, see how long it will take you to get there. Add an additional fifteen minutes to the commute. It is better to be early. Your future employer will see that as a commitment to you career.\n\nShow Confidence.\n\nBy practicing and planning ahead of time for the interview, you will feel more comfortable during the interview. However, it is natural to feel nervous. Practice little tricks to help you stay calm. One trick is taking deep breaths to help you relax. Another trick is to visualize kicking yourself when you feel nervous. Always remember to keep eye contact with the interviewer.\n\nIf Unsure, Ask.\n\nIf the interviewer asks a complicated question, do not be afraid to ask for clarification. By trying to second guess what the interviewer is asking, you may waste time giving him unnecessary information. By having him restate a question, shows the interviewer that you are a careful listener.\n\nKeep Things Positive.\n\nIt is best not to show any negative feelings about past job experiences. For example, if you are looking for a job because of personality conflicts in your current place of employment, do not express this. The interviewer may see this as a negative attitude. It is better to state that you are looking for a change.\n\nShow Interest of the Company\n\nAsk questions and have the interviewer share information about the company. Ask about long-term objectives, problems and issues the company is facing, and changes the organization may face in the future. The interviewer, as long as the information is not confidential, will be willing to share this.\nGood luck during your interview.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.",

        "text":"PhD Dissertation Writing Is Extremely Complex\n\nWhat is required in a dissertation? What are the expectations? What do you stand to lose if your dissertation is not up to par? You may be asking these questions, and more. The dissertation is the crowning jewel on all the research that goes into the requirements for obtaining a doctoral degree.\n\nDefinition of a PhD dissertation\n\nA dissertation is a document written by a PhD candidate that is required as part of the process of awarding an academic degree. The dissertation is a representation of the author\u2019s research, findings and conclusion.\n\nProcess of writing a dissertation\n\n1) Choose a topic, determine the central question; then formulate a clear objective which answers the question.\n\n2) Gather and organize all the sources you want to use. Research, research, research! Don\u2019t leave any stones unturned.\n\n3) Lay out a structure \u2013 outline if you will- for your dissertation. Include the following constituents:\n\nThere are quite a few parts to the dissertation, and each part may take shorter or longer, depending on how fast you want to work. But for most students the research is a very time-consuming task. Gathering all your notes and thoughts together also takes a considerable amount of time.\n\nA dissertation is not one small essay. It\u2019s more like a book. They can be several hundred pages long or even more. Starting with the right topic can make all the difference in keeping your interest level up and your motivation level high. It can take a number of years to complete all the work that goes into writing a dissertation.\n\nYou have a lot to lose if you don\u2019t finish your dissertation. You have already invested so much into it, there\u2019s no reason to quit now. Divide your work up into smaller-sized chunks, so it doesn\u2019t look so intimidating. Next, decide to do at least one thing per day until it is finished.\n\nThis is not the time to procrastinate. If you take it seriously and realize that you need to buckle down and get some work done, then maybe you will have a successful dissertation. If you have been working hard but realize that you need help, don\u2019t be ashamed to ask. Your academic advisor or professor can help. An online writing service can help.

        "text":"How to upload a revised version of your paper in Manuscript\u00a0Central\n\nAfter you have edited your paper in response to the comments you received from the editors and referees, you will need to upload a new version of the paper in Manuscript Central. While many journals use this same software, the configuration is often different in many details. The guidance here should help to avoid the editorial office un-submitting the paper and asking you to attend to some detailed point. Paying attention at this stage will help to smooth the processing of your paper.\n\n  1. To revise your paper, log into and enter your Author Centre, where you will find your Document title listed under \u201cManuscripts with Decisions.\u201d\n  2. Under \u201cActions,\u201d click on \u201cCreate a Revision.\u201d Your manuscript number will have a revision number appended, to denote a revision (R1 for first revision, R2 for second revision, and so on). This means that anything you do under this reference number will not remove or replace anything in the system for the earlier version of the paper.\n  3. You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the paper and other files you previously uploaded, although they will all be listed and downloadable until you remove the old versions from this new record. Instead, revise your paper using a word processing program and save it on your computer. Please also highlight the changes within the document by using the track changes mode in MS Word or by using bold or coloured text if the changes are extensive.\n  4. Please upload Tables and Figures in an editable format, to save us having to come back to you for minor requests relating to capitalization, layout and grey shading. Avoid uploading PDFs, for example.\n  5. Once you have revised your paper, you can upload it and submit it through your Author Centre. To avoid long and arbitrary filenames, it is handy to use the Reference number, including revision number, as a filename. For example, RCME-MD-10-0023.R3.docx for the main body of the paper, RCME-MD-10-0023.R3-Table2.docx for a Table separately uploaded, MD-10-0023.R3-Ack.docx for the acknowledgements, and so on.\n  6. When submitting your revised paper, it is very important that you respond to all of the editorial requirements and the comments made by the reviewers, in the space provided. You should use this space to document any changes you make to the original paper. In order to expedite the processing of the revised paper, please be as specific as possible in your response to the reviewers. List each Editorial requirement and Referee comment one-by-one, and then explain what you did in response to it. Please do not set this out as a Table, but as a list, so that you can paste it into the space on the form for your response to the referees. This list will be sent to referees to help them judge the extent to which the paper has been developed.\n  7. IMPORTANT: Your original files are available to you when you upload your revised manuscript. Please delete any redundant files before completing the submission. This includes deleting all the files from the previous submission that have now been superseded. (They remain stored under the earlier version\u2019s reference number.)\n  8. When you have deleted the old files, uploaded your new files, entered your responses to the referees\u2019 comments and everything is ready, you still need to click \u201cSubmit\u201d on screen 7. And you can only click \u201cSubmit\u201d after you have previewed your PDF. Please do look at the PDF before you click \u201cSubmit\u201d, to ensure that your graphics and tables have converted properly.\n  9. You may log out of this process at any point, with your submission incomplete. As long as you clicked \u201cSave and Continue\u201d or \u201cSave and Go Back\u201d before your exited, everything will be still there when you come back. However, when you return at a later time, you will find the unfinished resubmission under \u201cRevised Manuscripts in Draft\u201d. Click on that, then scroll to the bottom of the screen to continue the process.\n\n\nAbout Will\n\nProfessor of Construction Management and Economics, University of Reading, UK.

        "text":"Teaching How to Read Mathematics\n\nAt this time of year many teachers are picking the calculus book for their class to use next year. At the same time you will find teachers complaining, quite correctly, that their students don\u2019t read their math textbooks. Authors, editors and their focus groups try their very best to make books \u201creadable,\u201d to no avail, since students won\u2019t read them anyway.\n\nMaybe this is because students have never learned to read math books, because no one has ever taught them how. Have you? Here are some thoughts and suggestions gathered from several sources that may help.\n\nFirst, some obvious (to us) comments, which, alas, probably won\u2019t make much of a change in students\u2019 ways:\n\n  \u2022 It takes time to read a math book. Unlike a novel or a non-fiction book, a few pages of mathematics will take longer than reading a story or essay.\n  \u2022 Readers should stop every few lines and make sure they understand what they\u2019ve read\n  \u2022 Readers should have pencil and paper handy both to take notes, to draw graphs, to work through some of the examples.\n  \u2022 Math books contain examples to help the reader understand what\u2019s going on; so readers should work (i.e. with paper and pencil) through the examples.\n  \u2022 Readers should make note of what they don\u2019t understand and ask about it in class.\n\nHere are some things you can do to help your students at all levels learn to read a mathematics textbook. The sooner students learn to read mathematics the better. Work with your pre-Algebra and Algebra 1 teachers (or earlier) to get them started. The sooner the better, but if they have not done it before they get to your calculus class do it then.\n\n  1. Start with short reading assignments and spend some time before and after discussing both what they read and how they read it. Do not do this forever, rather\n  2. Don\u2019t reread the text to them or follow the text exactly in you class discussions; make them responsible for understanding what you\u2019ve assigned them to read. Of course, you should answer questions on anything they didn\u2019t understand, but expect them (eventually) to learn from what they read.\n  3. A brief but structured reading organizer can be a help. Have them make notes on what they read in a form like this:\n    1. In your textbook read section ___.__, \u00a0pages ____ to ____\n    2. What is this section about? What is the main idea?\n    3. There are ____ new definitions (or vocabulary words) in this section. For each, express the definition in your own words, include a drawing if appropriate.\n    4. There are ____ new theorems (rules, laws, formulas) in this section. For each, write its hypothesis and conclusion and explain what it means in your own words, include a sketch if appropriate.\n    5. Which application or example was most interesting or instructive for you? Why?\n    6. Is there anything you find confusing or do not understand in the reading?\n\nThe next day in class meet in groups of 3 or 4 and compare answers: Does everyone in the group agree on the new vocabulary? Which paraphrase is better? Which example\/application was the most interesting? Why? What questions do you still have?\n\nHold the students responsible for doing this work by not repeating what they have just read as a formal lesson on the same material. Approach the material from a different way; probe their understanding with questions.\n\nInstead of a lecture on the material they read, just have a discussion on it. Let the students lead the way explaining what they think the text means, why the examples were chosen, and what they are still unsure of.\n\nIn my next two posts I intend to discuss definitions and theorems in more detail \u2013 their structure and how to help students use the structure to increase their understanding.\n\nThe Electronic Discussion Group or EDG run by the College Board for AP Calculus which has now become the AP Calculus Community is an excellent source of help and information. Some of the ideas here are taken from an EDG discussion on helping students read mathematics textbooks. I\u2019ve also used and expanded ideas from Dixie Ross, Stephanie Sains, Jon Stark, and David Wang that appeared on the EDG. Thanks to them all.\n\n3 thoughts on \u201cTeaching How to Read Mathematics\n\n  1. Mr. Macmillan, I have learned so much from you through your blog. Can you help me further by explaining the scoring statistic of 2012 and 2011 exams. I could not understand why there are more than 6 questions. And which is split in two. If split then how to explain which question has what mean score. My students asked for mean score of let\u2019s say # 4, 2011 FRQ. What would be that. 2.29? Or 2.74? Thank you so much.\n\n    Sonal Patel\n\n\n    \u2022 One of the BC questions (2011 BC 3 listed as questions 3 and 4) contributes to the AB sub-score on the BC exam. Part 3A was part of the AB sub-score, 3A, 3B and 3C all counted to the regular BC score. The means for this question are listed in two parts, one for the AB (called question 3) and the other for the BC only (called question 4). The overall mean for this question is the sum of the parts. (listed as 3 to 4). Questions 4 to 6 were renumbered as 5 to 7.\n      I hope that makes sense.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

It is common for individuals to agonize over writing a resume and more often than not the finished product looks more like a career obituary or personal statement than a first class ticket to your dream job. A resume is an advert, an advert that introduces an individual, their career achievements to date and predicts how they will perform in their next role.\n\nWith only one resume out of every 200 leading to an interview, it is important to ensure that yours is the one that gets noticed. There are a number of key tips to writing a resume that will come alive in the readers' hand, read on to find out more.\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Research\n\nBefore starting to write your resume you need to do some preliminary research so you can tailor it to the jobs that you wish to apply for. Writing a broad resume can exclude you from specific positions that you apply for.\n\no What do I want to do? Research job specifications, websites, industry press.\n\no What makes me the best candidate for any job? Research job specifications, websites and industry press to discover the types of candidate's organizations are looking for. Use this research and speak to people within the industry to draw up a list of your skills, characteristics and experience that makes you the best candidate for any job.\n\no Select the jobs that you would like to apply for\n\nStep 2 Write your primary job objective (this gives the reader incentive to read on)\n\nAn XX position in an organization where YY and ZZ would be required.\n\nStep 3 Write your summary\n\nUsing the research and brainstorming create a summary that articulately matches your skills and experience to the job requirements.\n\no A short phrase describing your profession\no A statement of broad or specialized expertise\no Use 2\/3 additional statements\no Breadth & depth of skills\no Unique mix of skills\no Special or well documented accomplishment\no Awards, promotions or superior performance\no 1 or 2 professional or appropriate personal characteristics\no Add in the sentence you created in Step 2\n\nE.g. Solution focused and driven human resources executive with eight years experience in strategic management and large scale recruitment projects. The national lead for retention policies within a large healthcare provider that has lead to a 15 reduction in turnover among nurses nationwide. Seeking a senior HR management role that offers extensive project work.\n\nStep 4 Resume Format\n\nNow you have your job objective and summary, choose what format of resume best suits your type of job search. There are 3 main types of resumes:\n\nChronological \u2013 This is the most common. It is a chronological listing of your work experience with the most recent first. It is best for:\n\no People who have practical work experience without long periods of unemployment and minimal job \/ industry changes.\n\no Individuals who have shown growth within a single professions\n\nFunctional \u2013 This resume format focuses on skills, credentials and accomplishments. It highlights what the strengths are rather than when \/ where they were developed. The main formatting difference is that after the job summary \/ objective you list your professional or business skills and successes, followed by a list of the positions held. It is best for individuals who:\n\no Have lots of job experience and many jobs\no Are just entering the work force with no \/ little track record\no Are just pre retirement and have lots of work experience\no Are returning after a period of absence (return after maternity\/paternity leave or long term sickness)\no Are changing careers \/ do not have consistent career growth\no Are Military personnel seeking civilian jobs\n\nCombination \u2013 This resume format is a combination of the chronological and functional types. It is best for individuals who:\n\no Are advancing in the prospective careers and have an established track record they want to keep.\n\nStep 5 Success Stories\n\nWhatever format you choose you still want to include between 2 5 professional success stories for each role you have had. A useful method to help you create a strong resume is the mnemonic is CARS.

        "text":"Good Practice Habits\n\nIt's easy to make rapid progress in your music study if you make good practice a habit. Follow these hints:\n\n  \u2022 Learning is automatic. The experience of the music lesson itself makes a lasting impression on a student. If you come to your lesson with an open mind, the stage is set for dynamic learning throughout the week.\n  \u2022 Music is meant to be played, not worked to the bone. Don't be a perfectionist! Have fun and you'll get good results.\n  \u2022 \"Rome wasn't built in a day.\" Don't expect to make big changes overnight. A good attitude, applied little by little, ensures future improvement.\n  \u2022 Ask for help. If you get stuck, someone at home might have the answer. You can always phone your teacher if you need to.\n  \u2022 Short practice sessions are best. Youngsters can accomplish a lot in a five-minute review. Depending upon the individual, older students can also benefit from several short practice periods versus one long one.\n  \u2022 Look over your lesson assignment soon after your lesson. Your memory will be solidified and you'll feel more confident about completing it than if you wait until the last minute.\n  \u2022 Organize your practice session. Make a decision on what you want to accomplish. Do the easiest things first. Only practice what you feel like doing, unless you're in the mood for a challenge.\n  \u2022 Guitar and Piano Practice Directions can be found in your books. Follow them step by step. Younger Voice students \"practice\" throughout the week every time they use their speaking or singing voices. Students will continue to make new mental connections with each practice experience.\n  \u2022 Private Voice Lesson assignments include:\n    \u2022 memorizing songs,\n    \u2022 listening to other singers with a discerning ear,\n    \u2022 being nice to yourself when you review your own lesson tapes,\n    \u2022 use tapes for sing-along practice,\n    \u2022 take concise notes in your Voice Journal after each lesson, and\n    \u2022 review notes often.\n  \u2022 \"Practice makes perfect!\" Don't just hack away at something, repeating the same mistakes over and over. Sometimes merely sitting and thinking about perfect practice can make all the difference. Take your time, relax and breathe. Imagine your beautiful music before you actually play or sing it.\n\nContact us\n\n\nYou are such a resource and inspiration to my being.\n\n- H.
