        "text":"How to Eat Radish Pods\n\n\nMost radishes are grown for their edible roots, which may be mild or pungent and are eaten raw or cooked in a variety of cuisines. The seed pods of radishes are also edible, and one family of radishes - Raphanas caudatus, often called \"rat-tailed radishes\" - is grown especially for its seed pods. These are a fascinating garden plant, and enjoyed a notable vogue during the 19th century. They have a pungent radish flavor when eaten raw or lightly cooked, and grow milder the longer they are cooked.\n\nThings You'll Need\n\n  \u2022 Radish pods\n  \u2022 Colander\n  \u2022 Paper towel\n  \u2022 Steamer\n  \u2022 Pot\n  \u2022 Wok\n  \u2022 Rinse the radish pods under cold running water in a colander. Allow the pods to drain for five minutes, and pat them dry with a paper towel. Pinch off the stem ends, if woody.\n\n  \u2022 Add the radish pods raw to salads or plates of fresh vegetables for dipping. They have a fresh, pungent radish flavor with a distinct heat, but with more complexity than a conventional radish. They make an excellent foil for strongly flavored greens and vinaigrettes, and also complement strong cheeses such as feta or goat.\n\n  \u2022 Steam the pods lightly as a side dish, or boll them in a pot of salted water. Steamed pods will retain more pungent radish heat than boiled pods, but both will mellow as they are cooked longer. Serve warm with butter or cold with olive oil and lemon or a light vinaigrette.\n\n  \u2022 Stir-fry the pods on their own as a side dish, or add them to your favorite Asian stir-fry or pad Thai. The pods retain much of their pungency when lightly cooked, making them an alternative to mild chilies in many dishes.\n\nTips & Warnings\n\n  \u2022 Pick the seed pods as soon as they fill out, but before they become dry and leathery. The seeds may be shucked from mature pods and eaten separately. The mature seeds are very strong, and should be boiled or steamed to moderate their flavor. They may be added to a dish of boiled or steamed peas for an interesting flavor combination.\n\nRelated Searches\n\n\n  \u2022 Photo Credit Jupiterimages\/Creatas\/Getty Images\nPromoted By Zergnet\n\n\nYou May Also Like\n\n  \u2022 How to Cook with Radishes\n\n    Radishes are rich in vitamin C and minerals, nearly calorie-free and serve as a great antioxidant.

These home baked brioche style rolls, on the other hand, are like bread perfection. I'd recommend veering towards wholegrain to stay on the low cholesterol straight and narrow, but as the occasional healthy treat, these white brioche are the best rolls ever.\n\n\n  \u2022 500g Strong White Bread Flour\n  \u2022 Sachet Allinsons Yeast\n  \u2022 Drizzle Rape Seed Oil\n  \u2022 1 Egg beaten (half for dough, half for Egg Wash)\n  \u2022 10g Salt\n  \u2022 1 tsp Sugar\n  \u2022 350 ml Warm Water\n  \u2022 Poppy Seeds\n\nMix the ingredients (500g Flour, 10g Salt, Sachet Yeast, drizzle Oil, 1 tsp Sugar, half a beaten Egg and 350 ml warm Water) together in a large bowl, and knead on a counter for 15 minutes\n\nAt the beginning, the dough is likely to be quite wet \u2013 but it will come together after a good knead, and floppy dough makes delicious rolls\u2026\n\nAfter kneading, sprinkle a bit of Flour on the dough and put it back in the bowl, leaving it somewhere warm to rise (bowl covered with a clean tea towel) for 1 hour\n\nAfter an hour, knock the dough back into place (it should have risen and be up to twice its original size by now)\n\nDivide the dough into 8 \u2013 10 pieces and roll into balls\n\nPlace each dough ball on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper\n\nBrush with Egg Wash (or Milk)\n\nCover with cling film (maybe sprayed with Oil so it doesn\u2019t stick?) and leave the rolls for an hour again \u2013 somewhere warm\n\nAfter this hour, the rolls should have got bigger\u2026 Brush them again with Egg Wash and sprinkle with Poppy Seeds\n\nCook for 15 \u2013 20 minutes or until golden\n\nCool on a rack before enjoying\u2026 These are great with Pulled Pork, or Beef Brisket. \u00a0They are also delicious with Veggie Burgers or some Smoked Salmon\u2026.\n\nTagged ,",

        "text":"Thursday, 21 October 2010\n\nVictoria Sandwich\n\nThe Victoria Sandwich is an icon of British baking and has been doing the rounds at the likes of picnics, fetes, parties and cricket teas since time dot. Moreover, it's not too hard to understand the reason for this: it requires little ingredients, is simple to make - especially when using an all-in-one recipe - and, of course, tastes fabulous.\n\nPresentation-wise, a Victoria Sandwich is filled with a jam filling and, for the more indulgent among us, an additional layer of whipped cream. Alternatively, as I know from many Birthday cakes my Mother made for me when growing up, the Victoria Sandwich can provide the perfect basis for cakes with elaborate icings and decorations.\n\nThe following is a tried-and-tested recipe for those who fancy a spell in he kitchen.\n\n\n3 eggs\n\nSelf-raising flour\n\nCaster sugar\n\n\n\nWhipped cream (optional)\n\n\n1) Get out eggs, flour, sugar and butter well in advance of baking so everything is up to room temperature and the fat is nice and soft.\n\n2) Preheat oven to 200oC.\n\n3) Grease and base-line two 8in (20cm) round cake tins.\n\n4) Place eggs on scales and weigh out equivalent amounts of flour, sugar and butter.\n\n5) Cream the butter and sugar before adding the eggs one at a time and stirring in.\n\n6) Steadily add flour and fold it in so as much air as possible is incorporated.\n\n7) Turn out mixture into prepared tins dividing it equally.\n\n8) Place in the oven and bake for 20-25 mins or until it springs back to the touch or slightly shrinks back from the sides of the tin.\n\n9) Remove from oven and leave to cool a bit before turning out on to wire racks.\n\n10) Once cooled completely, add a layer of jam to one of the sponges. If you wish to add a layer of whipped cream, take the other sponge, invert it and spread with cream.\n\n11) Combine the two halves so the filling is sandwiched between the two sponges and finish by dusting the top of the cake with icing sugar.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

ENJOY!\n\nFeatured Pinch Tips Video\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 2 votes\n5 Min\n20 Min\n\n\n2 cups thai jasmine-scented white rice\n2 cups good-quality coconut milk\n1 3\/4 cups water\n2 heaping tbsp. dry shredded unsweetened coconut (baking type)\n1\/2 tsp. salt\n1\/2 tsp. coconut oil, or vegetable oil\n\n\n1Rub oil over the bottom of a deep-sided pot. You will also need a tight-fitting lid.\n\n2Place rice, coconut milk, water, shredded coconut, and salt in the pot and set over medium-high to high heat. Stir occasionally to keep rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot and burning.\n\n3Once the coconut-water has begun to gently bubble, stop stirring and reduce heat to low (just above minimum). Cover tightly with a lid and let simmer 15-20 minutes, or until most of the liquid has been absorbed by the rice. To check, pull rice aside with a fork. If most of the coconut milk-water is gone, go on to the next step.\n\n4Replace the lid and turn off the heat, but leave the covered pot on the burner to steam another 5-10 minutes, or until you're ready to eat. Tip: Your Coconut Rice will stay warm this way for up to 1 hour or more, great for when you're expecting company!\n\n5When ready to serve, remove the lid and fluff rice with a fork or chopsticks. Taste-test the rice for salt, adding a little more if needed. Serve right out of the pot, or transfer to a serving bowl. This rice is excellent served with a variety of both Thai and Indian dishes, such as curries or seafood recipes.
