With a passion for film, creating change and some serious wanderlust, Cornelia and Lindsey have set off on a journey to experience the world and the many excitingly diverse communities the best way they can; through sustainable travel practices and meeting women from all walks of life to hear their stories of strength and inspiration.\u00a0\n\nWant to relish in the natural beauty amongst the Himalayas in Nepal while still giving back to a local community? Ever wondered what constitutes happiness for different women from one country to another? What about finding the most mouth watering curries on the streets of Mumbai, while still learning about the realities women face in their daily lives? How does this all differ from one country to another?\n\nOur quest is to speak to women of all ages, from all backgrounds, to discover their passion for life and living! While showing wanderers like yourself, the many gems in travelling sustainably.",

Mark went out of his way to make us feel welcome, the room was beautifully decorated, comfy bed with gorgeous bedding and lots of biscuits..always a good sign!

Would definitely stay again! Many thanks Mark and\u00a0Mike! read more reviews\n\nA Great place for a light lunch\n\nMarionD Review We were passing by, called in with no booking on a sunny day, there is a marquee outside (roadside) where there are fixed tables that are all socially distanced. A warm welcome, hand sanitiser, contact details taken, contact less payment \u2013 all the food was delivered by staff wearing a mask. You can order food on line if you wish and they will deliver to the table.\n\nWe chose a ham sandwich and also the pork pie ploughman\u2019s, both of which were well presented and equally filling.\n\nA lovely village pub \u2013 recommended!\n\nread more reviews\n\nLovely food, nice atmosphere\n\nNiall Review Stayed overnight in this lovely old inn, nice big room and pleasant hosts.
