        "text":"Beyonce Strikes A Pregnant Pose\n\nBeyonce Strikes A Pregnant Pose\n\nMom-to-be Beyonce was in fine form at last night\u2019s screening of her new DVD release, Live at Roseland: The Elements of 4, at the Paris Theatre in New York City (November 20).\n\nCovering her growing belly in a long black Cavali gown with gold accents, the \u2018Single Ladies\u2019 singer looked positively radiant as she posed for pictures on her way into the show.\n\nDue in February, the baby will be the first for Bey and her husband Jay-Z. Though the couple haven\u2019t revealed whether they\u2019re thinking pink or blue, Beyonce\u2019s friend Kelly Rowland recently let slip the big news: It\u2019s a girl!\n\nView Slideshow \u00bb\u00bb\n\nView All Photos \u00bb\u00bb\n\nFiled under: Beyonce,Expecting\n\nPhoto credit: Fame\n\n  \u2022 anonymous\n\n    Beyonce looks beautiful as always. I so don\u2019t want to sound like a hater because I don\u2019t have anything against her whatsoever but I have to say that her bump in the first picture looks very questionable.\n\n    \u2022 Anonymous\n\n      I completely agree! I don\u2019t know weather it\u2019s the dress or something else but her belly looks very fake here.\n\n  \u2022 LaKesha\n\n    Why would Beyonce need to fake a pregnancy?\n\n  \u2022 Al\n\n    I doubt anyone would question the authenticity of her baby bump if it wasn\u2019t for previous rumours. She shouldn\u2019t have to prove her pregnancy to anyone, and quite frankly, it shouldn\u2019t be anyone elses business to begin with. I agree with LaKesha, why would she? So ridiculous that people are even speculating that.\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous\n\n    They\u2019re not saying she\u2019s faking the pregnancy, it\u2019s just maybe she\u2019s not as far along as she wants us to think she is.\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous\n\n    It\u2019s because there is something so weird about this pregnancy. First there\u2019s the huge belly at the VMAs when it turns out she was only 3 months pregnant, then all the pictures shortly after where there was no belly to be seen, then that weird video interview where she walks out looking like she\u2019s in her third trimester and then her belly collapses on itself when she sits down. Now we see pictures of her out in public where it looks like she is barely showing, but every time she makes an official public appearance, her belly is big and round again. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. When a woman is pregnant, her belly gets gradually bigger until birth. It doesn\u2019t grow and shrink and disappear and then come back. I don\u2019t know if she IS or isn\u2019t. Or WHY she would. She\u2019s just had the strangest-looking \u201cpregnancy\u201d I\u2019ve ever seen. But time will tell.\n\n    \u2022 Anonymous\n\n      Take a look back at the photos of any celeb (because they\u2019re easily accessible). Depending on what they\u2019re wearing, their bump (God, I hate that expression) can look bigger or smaller, higher or lower.\n\n      The conspiracy theories surrounding this woman\u2019s pregnancy are hysterical!\n\nLatest Dish",

I need to get off my ass and start playing again.\n6\/16\/2016 6:24:52 AM\n\nIve messed around a bit in B tuning awhile ago too on one pillamyd song that was song 5 I believe, my new guitar handles the intonation really well considering its not setup to be that low, keeps in tune well.\n6\/15\/2016 10:06:40 PM\n\nI say go for it if you want to play in low tuning. I myself am a big fan of it. It wont hurt your guitar any. You may be a little out as far as intonation, but that just gives it flavor. If you have an adjustable bridge, its not that hard to fix that. If not, like I said, it would just give it that unique flavor.\n\n6\/15\/2016 10:42:24 AM\n\nMan, you can do what ever you want. I'm just the color commutator to your Howard Cosell.\n6\/14\/2016 12:07:01 PM\n\nI usually dont go low anymore because im afraid my guitar isnt set up for lower tunings, but id love to do a couple songs as low as B tuning haha.\n6\/14\/2016 11:59:13 AM\n\nAny tunings you want me to play around in on some tracks to change the sound a little?\u00a0 Like standard or C# tuning, im sure using Eb all the time makes things stale.\u00a0 I used to use C# alll the time in pillamyd\n6\/14\/2016 11:58:20 AM\n\nThis is probably one of my favorite songs we've done.\n5\/9\/2016 7:19:11 AM\n\nGood luck.

I wouldn't hold your breath.\nI'm starting to get a handle on this mixing thing. Every song I work on I get a little better at it. Just now starting to get into using the \"Send\" channels for some FX and leveling. Seems to make a world of difference.\n\n5\/5\/2016 12:44:24 AM\n\nkryptic2096 has updated the song workspace settings. The workspace title has been changed to Toxic Embrace\n5\/5\/2016 12:43:34 AM\n\nThat sounds great, I dont know a thing about mastering haha.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This needs some vocals soon, are you going to do them or are we finding another member for this band, anyway it goes its going to be kickass.\n4\/13\/2016 5:30:34 AM\n\nStill need to mess with the mix but the bass line is pretty much done. Not sure if I like the pre solo part and I might redo that.\n\n4\/2\/2016 7:55:01 AM\n\nStill needs some work but tuning down really helped bring it together. Still want to do some work with my bass on the pre solo part. That and about 20 hours on the mixing board and it should be done.\n\n4\/1\/2016 1:37:00 AM\n\nBeing in E flat would explain why I was having problems finding a good tone for this.\nI went from drop D to standard tuning before I got close. Ill drop down to E flat and go at it again. ITS ALL GOOOOD\n\n3\/31\/2016 11:23:26 PM\n\nI'm stupid for not saying I played this in e flat tuning, my bad.\n3\/31\/2016 11:16:51 PM\n\nIts sounding good man, yea I hate playing when my wrists hurt\n\nView Older Posts\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2007 - 2016 Ciliberti Enterprises Corporation.

Bringing those written words to life as if they're being spoken for the first time, doubly so. Add to that coordinating the timing of several individuals, along with lighting and sounds cues, and this cast of performers has got their work cut out for them! However, they rise to the challenge admirably....\"\n\nI mean, I appreciate the recognition that good improv takes skill, that making it up doesn't mean we're lazy, that the chance (and sometimes actuality) of failure is part of what makes improv what it is. But still. I would love to see the day when reviewers and audiences have come to accept improv as more art than parlor trick. A lot of reviewers here seem to be impressed by how many gimmicks a group can put in their show, listing off like assets the number of ask-fors and trappings of form a group can fit in to a single longform show, as if recounting the dangerous and unwieldy objects a juggler can manage to keep in the air. A flaming chainsaw! An unrelated show title and location! Musical callbacks every 3 beats! 6 foot daggers!\n\nWhat I long for is a deeper recognition of how improv really works- that it's not who can be funniest quickest with the most encumberments, but is instead an acute awareness as a group, a loving attention to detail, and a willingness to be vulnerable, open, and in the moment that make great improv, whatever the style or format, as well as a lot of work and practice beforehand.\nParallelogramophonographpargonohpomargolellarap: It's a palindrome!\nUser avatar\nPosts: 1421\nJoined: August 15th, 2005, 1:31 am\nLocation: Austin\n\nPostby Rev.
