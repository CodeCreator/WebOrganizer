Roland Orzabal\/Tears for Fears, 1982\n\nSo my brother-in-law makes these videos of my niece and nephew, which I do appreciate since they live in Ohio of all places (that might have come out sounding wrong). The last one he sent had this beautiful piano music as its soundtrack \u2013 when I asked, he answered that it might be Michael Andrews, in an intro to a remake of Mad World by Tears for Fears.\n\nSo I youtubed it and, indeed, that\u2019s it. Beautiful song.\n\nI\u2019ve listened to it a few times since I received the latest twins video last week, and only tonight did my mind make its way around these lines \u2013 hello teacher tell me what\u2019s my lesson? look right through me, look right through me.\n\nIn my last post we reflected on the human qualities teachers \u2013 we \u2013 bring to our classrooms. One of the strongest just might be the ability to both do and not do what this line is asking.\n\nG-d forbid, as teachers, we look through our students. Imagine being invisible? I\u2019ve known how that feels. Like I don\u2019t exist. That\u2019s the part not to do.\n\nimage found here, on the pbase gallery of backtothestart.\n\nAt the same time, when a student arrives in my classroom she is implicitly asking for her lesson.\n\nShe is asking me for her lesson.\n\nAnd if I look right through her, past her language, her colour, her attitude wrought from years of learned helplessness and strong wall making and straight to her, I just may be able to find the lesson she\u2019s asking for.\n\n\nimage found here, by accident, at a Physics blog by teacher Dean Baird. I\u2019ve bookmarked it.\n\nThat\u2019s the part to do. That maybe I wrote about? That is where my heart leads me.",

You may be asking these questions, and more. The dissertation is the crowning jewel on all the research that goes into the requirements for obtaining a doctoral degree.\n\nDefinition of a PhD dissertation\n\nA dissertation is a document written by a PhD candidate that is required as part of the process of awarding an academic degree. The dissertation is a representation of the author\u2019s research, findings and conclusion.\n\nProcess of writing a dissertation\n\n1) Choose a topic, determine the central question; then formulate a clear objective which answers the question.\n\n2) Gather and organize all the sources you want to use.
