Rules Governing Membership\nThe Board of Directors will enact rules governing voluntary withdrawal of membership, termination of membership, the membership application process, provisions for appeal of denial of membership and adoptions.\n\nSECTION 5. Council Decision on Membership\nThe Board of Directors shall provide in the rules governing membership that the Nation\u2019s Council shall make final decision on the Nation\u2019s membership.

A Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood certified that an individual possesses a specific degree of Indian blood of a federally recognized Indian Tribe. There are some programs and services based upon your status as an American Indian, which require you to furnish this card before services are rendered. A CDIB card does Not establish membership in a federally recognized Indian Tribe, and it does not prevent an Indian Tribe from making a separate and independent determination of blood degree for tribal purposes. Prior to 1989 the Bureau of Indian Affairs issued these cards to Wyandotte Indians. After 1989, the Wyandotte Nation issued Tribal-issued CDIB cards.\n\nTo apply for a CDIB card:\n\n1.
