        "text":"DryBuddy Bedwetting Alarms: Stop bedwetting with ease and convenience\n\nBedwetting is a condition that influences the self-esteem of a kid and makes him\/her mortified. This is where the use of bedwetting alarm comes in, bedwetting alarm is a tool that assists your kid to wake up from the sleep when his\/her bladder is full.\n\nThough bedwetting is more common among kids, it needs to be taken seriously. Treating it fast can prevent any inconvenience as well as the problem worsening, consulting a doctor or a medical specialist such as a gynaecologist or a specialist in continence can help you find out more and what treatments are available to you.\n\nThe Technical term for bedwetting is enuresis, the child cannot control his bladder after the age of five and this leads to bedwetting, before age five a child may wet the bed due to other factors. These factors can include heredity, a smaller bladder or maybe something as simple as being a deep sleeper and not able to feel the urge to go restroom.\n\nParents must be aware that a DryBuddy bedwetting alarm would be the greatest solution for any bed wetter within the family, these alarms commonly exist as wireless, but the wireless drybuddy bedwetting alarm would positively be the perfect one for your kids. Bed-wetting alarms perform as a behavior conditioning product.\n\nThe following might be one of the causes for bed wetting:\n\n  \u2022 Physical problem\n  \u2022 Psychological or emotional problem\n\nPhysical problems:\n\nPhysical problems may be due to any kind of kidney problem, bladder problem, abnormal nervous problem or the presence of certain diseases etc. leads to bedwetting. These problems can be treated with the help of DryBuddy Bedwetting alarm.\n\nPsychological or emotional problems:\n\nIf there are no physical problems, then check out for any other emotional problems. Following can be the reason for bedwetting in children:\n\n  \u2022 Fear\n  \u2022 Stress\n  \u2022 Tension\n  \u2022 Anxiety\n\nThese problems can also be solved using DryBuddy bedwetting alarm.\n\nHow DryBuddy works:\n\nA simple 3-step process\u2026\n\n  \u2022 The DryBuddy sensor registers urination during sleep (or while the patient is awake).\n  \u2022 Upon sensing the urine, the sensor sends a wireless signal which is picked up by a receiver in the patient\u2019s room, attached to an alarm. The alarm is activated to wake the patient. At the same time, other receivers\/alarms in the house also receive the signal.\n  \u2022 The additional modules (in the caregiver\u2019s room or elsewhere) then alert the caregiver, who wakes the patient and makes sure that the proper steps are taken. This is the difference between DryBuddy and other enuresis products \u2013 many children are too sleepy to take care of themselves on their own \u2013 that is why the intervention of a parent\/caregiver is important and necessary for successful training. However, with DryBuddy, it is not necessary for the caregiver to sleep in the same room with the patient in order to be alerted. The remote control allows the caregiver to control the bedwetting alarm system from his\/her bedroom.\n\nOur Enuresis alarm stops bedwetting with ease and convenience for all!\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Egg Freezing\n\n(703) 437.7722 | Highest Success Rates \u2022 Personal Attention \u2022 Affordable Treatment\n\nPlan ahead for your future fertility with egg freezing\n\nEgg freezing, or oocyte preservation, is a proven technology that allows women to freeze their eggs and store them for use in the future. At Virginia Center for Reproductive Medicine, we are able to stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple eggs and retrieve them from your ovaries.\n\nEgg freezing and IVF, when the time is right, helps women achieve the goal of a pregnancy on their terms and timeline.\n\nYour biological clock is a reality; freezing your eggs stops it\n\nVCRM is pleased to announce its new financial program to encourage women to freeze their eggs for fertility preservation. Our unique program allows you to pay 50% of the fee at treatment start and then pay the other 50% in monthly installments over one year with zero financing charge. This should help make this process within financial reach for most working women. For more details about our innovative program please call the office at 703-437-7722 or email us at\nWe want women to be informed about fertility and the reasons why egg freezing can help. A woman\u2019s fertility begins to decline in her early 20s and continues to progressively decline until she is in her late 30s, when fertility steeply declines.\n\nDeteriorating fertility can\u2019t be reversed, but egg freezing gives you the potential to avert the risks by preserving younger eggs. The age of a woman\u2019s eggs is directly related to the chances for getting pregnant.\n\nAt our Virginia fertility center, we encourage women to pursue egg freezing before age 38. After age 38, there are often fewer viable eggs available to be retrieved and preserved, necessitating multiple attempts to freeze enough eggs.\n\nWho is a good candidate for elective egg freezing?\n\nWomen may choose egg freezing for many different reasons.\n\n  \u2022 Single women in their late 20s and early-to-mid 30s who want to have a family in the future\n  \u2022 Women with a strong family history of early menopause or premature ovarian failure\n  \u2022 Women with ovarian endometriomas or recurring ovarian cysts\n  \u2022 Women undergoing fertility treatment who would prefer to freeze eggs, not embryos\n\nNow that this procedure has been proven to be a safe and reliable procedure, some women choose to use frozen eggs during IVF at our Virginia fertility center. Our laboratory staff performs a reliable, state-of-the-art technique called vitrification to freeze unfertilized eggs that can be fertilized at a later time.\n\nWe were pioneers in the process of freezing eggs\n\nVCRM was the first fertility center in the DC metro area to offer egg freezing in 2003. Dr. Fady Sharara, our dual board certified fertility specialist, and our experienced laboratory team will\u00a0oversee your procedure. If you are considering egg freezing, contact us. The future is in your hands.",
