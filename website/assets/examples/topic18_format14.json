We've been married for almost 5 years and love to travel the world, try new foods, play strategic board games, go hiking, and host dinner parties with our friends and family. Previously, Brett coached competitive gymnastics and Jana was a nanny in our hometown of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA. In January of 2016 we transitioned to virtual careers so that we could travel full-time. Brett still works for the same gymnastics facility in a remote capacity, and is also a Life Coach. Jana is a writer for a marketing company and parenting magazine.\u00a0\n\nStarting in July, Brett will begin working at our church in Tennessee as the Executive Pastor of Operations and Missions. This opportunity to serve at RIC was a direct answer to prayer, and we fully believe that our time here will equip and grow us for the upcoming season! The freedom of our time and location allows us to serve your congregation with our talents and giftings. Both of us have experience with youth, from babysitting to coaching to running around with our bunch of nieces and nephews. Jana has worked with the youth group at our home church for over 3 years, and Brett regularly played on the worship team.\u00a0\n\nWe'd love to get to know you! Say \"Hi\" on Sunday morning, send us an email (, or come hang out Sunday evenings at youth group!",

After careful and prayerful deliberation, the Missionary Search committee selected a gifted Social Worker and Minister to coordinate the Together for Hope Work in Louisiana.\n\nJenny is a recent MSW graduate from Baylor and also an MDiv graduate from Truett Seminary. For the previous year and a half, she served the Waco Regional Baptist Association, first as an intern and then as the paid Hunger Ministry Coordinator, a position she created.\nIn that capacity, she assisted congregations in developing \u00a0effective and holistic community hunger ministries.\u00a0 She also collaborated and worked with non-profit and faith-based organizations at the national, state, and local level on food insecurity issues and solutions.\n\nHer work led to the creation of a \u201cHow to Manual\u201d on ways congregations can engage in comprehensive hunger ministry and is posted at the Waco Association website.\n\nHer research project, focused on rural food insecurity, is titled an \u201cEthnography of a Rural, Ecumenical Food Pantry.\u201d\u00a0 Her research, work for the Association, and related ministries led to presentations at the CBF General Assembly in Fort Worth in June and to the National Association of Christian Social Workers in October.\n\nJenny has been active in community gardening and by training and passion has a deep interest in community development. She integrates seamlessly her faith and work.\n\nCBF-LA is excited that Together for Hope in Louisiana will continue in such able hands after the foundational work that Stephanie Vance completed after 3 years in December 2012. Stephanie will continue to be a resource to our work in East Carroll and Tensas Parish in her new capacity as CBF National Together for Hope Manager.\n\nYou may contact Jenny Hodge at:\n122 Scarborough Street\nLake Providence, LA 71254",

After completing a PhD in English Literature she became one of the first college professors in the country to set up a Women\u2019s Studies program, against much opposition from both men and women alike. Later in life, she experienced a kundalini awakening which changed her life forever and put her on a spiritual path of discovery. She has since published a number of books of mystic poetry and prose, and also keeps a blog called Kundalini Splendor. She now lives in Boulder, Colorado, and is a valued member of The Woman\u2019s Network community.\n\nMy Journey into Consciousness Many years ago, I was living in Kansas as a professor in a state university.

        "text":"Search our Site\n\nTim Lee was born and raised in southern Illinois to John and Wanda Lee. His father pastored Southern Baptist Churches for 60 years.\n\nIn 1971 while serving in the United States Marine Corps in South Vietnam Tim Lee gave both of his legs to America. Instead of quitting or becoming bitter God used this major event in Tim\u2019s life to propel him into a ministry that no one could have imagined at that time.\n\nTim pastored for five years in southern Illinois. He understands the rigors, challenges and difficulties and the blessings of being a pastor.\n\nHe has spent the past 40 years in active ministry as a full time evangelist. He has ministered in 49 states and numerous countries of the world. He has addressed thousands of local churches, Christian schools, civic organizations, colleges and universities as well as hundreds of special patriotic events. Tim Lee is known as the \u201cLegendary Speaker\u201d at MCRD Parris Island, where he speaks to thousands of Marines and Marine Recruits every year. For 25 years Tim and his family have hosted one of the most exciting teen camps in America called YOUTH ALIVE.\n\nTim Lee has a contagious zeal for revival and a fervent desire to win the lost to Christ. Since 1979 he has flown over 6 million miles to bring a strong message of revival, powerful biblical challenges to the family and a sobering message to the staggering moral and social needs so prevalent in our society today.\n\nTim Lee is not your \u201ctypical\u201d evangelist: in appearance\u2014he speaks from a wheelchair\u2014however most people within the first 5 minutes of listening to Tim forget all about the wheelchair and they become engrossed in the message that he is preaching.\n\nAt the request of President Reagan, Tim served on the Bicentinnnial committee for the 200th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution.\u00a0 He has been honored by the United States Marine Corps, The Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, numerous state legislatures and cities of all sizes as well as scores of other awards and special recognition of the past four decades.\u00a0 Tim serves as Co-Chair of the National Committee of Veterans for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. He is a contributor on Fox News and has written two books. Tim also serves on the board of directors of Trinity Baptist College in Jacksonville, Florida and has been on the Board of Trustees of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia since 1991. Tim has been awarded six honorary doctorate degrees including Liberty University, Trinity Baptist College, Emmanuel Theological Seminary, in Koto India, and Brewton Parker College, in Mount Vernon, Georgia.\n\nTim and his wife Connie have been maried for 46 years, and they live in Rowlett, Texas. They have three wonderful children, Brian, married to Jennifer, Jana, married to Steve Hooten, and Amber, married to Jonathan Livesay.\u00a0 Tim and Connie also have six awesome grandchildren, Emma, Reid, Ally, Andy, Sara, Case.\n\nTim Lee connects with his audience. With his passion and his deep burden for America and in his amazing ability to reach and appeal successfully to the person sitting in the pew, young and old, God is using Tim Lee to make a huge impact for the cause of Christ.\n\n\u201cAmerica is worth living for, worth fighting for and if need be, worth dying for.\u201d \u2013Tim Lee",
