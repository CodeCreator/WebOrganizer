        "text":"How to Start a Fashion Blog \u2013 5 Tips for Success\n\nAre you a fashion icon to all of your friends and want to take your style to the next level by starting a fashion blog? By following these 5 fashion blogging tips you will be well on your way to having a stylish, successful and fun fashion blog.\n\nTip 1: Be in the Know\nFashion blogs are quickly becoming the next big thing in the fashion industry. To understand how this blogging revolution is shaking up the fashion world you have to read what is already out there. Read the blogs of successful fashion schools, fashion merchandising schools, fashion community sites and research blogs that have caught your interest in the past. Knowing the type of blogs you like and don\u2019t will help you hone in on your own blogging style.\n\nTip 2: Create a Must Have Name\nIt\u2019s all in the name! You can have the best, most relatable fashion blog in the world, but without a catchy and easy-to-spell name that hints at what your blog is about, your future readers could be lost. Keep it simple. Keep it fun. Make it fashionable.\n\nTip 3: Have a Haute Template\nMost blog sites have templates that can be used to help you get started. Make sure to choose a template that is fun, not too hard on the eyes and easy to use. The most imperative aspect of your page is that readers can see, interact and search your posts.\n\nTip 4: Write What You Love\nWhat makes you and your fashion style unique is what is going to keep your readers coming back for more. Blogging takes time, dedication and can be frustrating at times, so if you are not writing about what you absolutely love, then it is all for naught. You know your style; don\u2019t be afraid to put it out there.\n\nTip 5: Don\u2019t Keep Your Fans Waiting\nThere is nothing worse than anticipating your favorite bloggers latest post to no avail. Some blogs are updated every day or even every hour, but for those who do not have that much time available to dedicate towards blogging, make sure you are updating your blog at least once a week to keep your readers interested and coming back for more. This way, you\u2019ll be able to build up a good base of loyal readers.",

        "text":"\n\nEvery week we put together our Friday 5 -five stories that compel us to read the lead sentence to the last sentence of an article. Here are our top 5 this week.\n\nWearables could soon be made of silk: Scientists are feeding silkworms GRAPHENE to make them produce strong and flexible materials that can also conduct electricity\n\n\u201cFrom smart socks to workout clothes that measure exertion, wearable body sensors are becoming the latest \u2018must-have\u2019 technology. Now, scientists are on the cusp of making them even stronger and more flexible, using silks. In a new study, scientists have been feeding silkworms graphene to make them produce strong and flexible materials that can also conduct electricity. The silk produced could be used to build more realistic robots that can sense\u00a0touch, temperature or humidity and even distinguish between people\u2019s voices.\u201d\n\nVia Daily Mail\n\nWhat Does It Actually Mean to Shop Ethically?\n\n\u201c\u2026if something is artisanal, does that automatically make it ethical? Like any industry, there are brands that excel, brands that could do better, and no 100 percent foolproof formula for getting it right.\u201d\n\nVia Racked\n\nHow wearable tech is giving people a sixth sense: Are health trackers imparting a permanent psycho-awareness of our bodies?\n\n\u201cIf you use a wearable long enough, you may not need one anymore. Some forms of health data tracking can increase users\u2019 bodily awareness, according to the 2016 book Self-tracking, written by University of Washington data scientist Gina Neff and Intel research scientist Dawn Nafus. \u201cThe data becomes a \u2018prosthetic of feeling\u2019, something to help us sense our bodies,\u201d they write. Eventually, like training wheels, the technology may be discarded altogether.\u201d\n\nVia The Outline\n\nNeo-Nazis are using fashion in an attempt to normalize. The fashion industry needs to speak up.\n\n\u201c\u2026the relevance of fashion in the conversation about racial hatred goes well beyond any particular brand. For an observer cognizant of the internal symbols and visual language of white nationalists, there was a lot to read: neo-Nazi, Proud Boy, skinhead, alt-right. But for the uninitiated, the style of dress was unremarkable. This wasn\u2019t a crowd filled with white robes and hoods.\u201d\n\nVia The Washington Post\n\nImage: New York Times\n\nSave New York City\u2019s Fashion Factories\n\n\u201cWe are a global fashion capital because this vibrant, innovative neighborhood has existed for nearly a hundred years. Within these blocks \u2014 between 35th and 40th Streets and Sixth and Ninth Avenues \u2014 all the components of the fashion process are within walking distance. This synergy brings hundreds of aspiring designers to New York each year to learn their craft and start their lines, and it sustains some 200,000 jobs and generates billions of dollars of revenue every year. Broadway and Off Broadway theaters as well as Lincoln Center costume houses all use the garment district daily. The fashion schools, including F.I.T., Parsons, Pratt, LIM, Kent State and others that have branches here, use the district as a springboard for young talent. The development corporation\u2019s plan puts all of this at risk.\u201d\n\nVia the New York Times\n\nTo learn more about how brands are taking on sustainable strategies, check out the Brooklyn Fashion + Design Accelerator\u2019s Sustainable Fashion Roadmap tool.",
