        "text":"\u2022 Chips have arrived!\n\n    bafeigum09\/26\/2014 at 19:24 4 comments\n\n    So my chips finally passed through customs and arrived in sealed anti-static bags. I connected up the VDD and GND to a bench power supply as others have noted that these chips need quite a bit of power. I also needed to connect the CH_PD pin to 3.3V to enable the chip. Just on standby, the chip consumes about 70mA.\u00a0\n\n    I connected the TX and RX lines to my Sparkfun FTDI Basic and fired up Putty\u00a0just to test out some commands before I hook it up to a chipKIT. I have to talk to the chip over 115200 Baud, and 57600\u00a0does not work. I received READY in my Putty terminal and sent AT+RST. The chip spit out a bunch of boot up text which I will include later when I write a post showing the response of all of the commands. I sent AT+CWLAP and nothing... at first I received ERROR. I sent it a couple more times and actually got the chip to list the access points! I tried connecting to my wifi router, but I entered the password wrong and still received OK. I tried sending the inquiry if I was connected and the chip hung up and any command I sent after that said it was busy. All further attempts to send AT+CWLAP hang up the chip.\n\n    So I would say so far, the chip isn't as easy to use out of the box as others have stated. I will investigate further and send some more commands and write up a post detailing how the chip responds.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Work still in progress...\n\n    bafeigum09\/11\/2014 at 17:04 1 comment\n\n    I am still awaiting the arrival of the modules I ordered from AliExpress. I have a tracking number, but it doesn't seem valid yet. It is great reading up on the progress others who have received their modules are making! Peter has been active in the comments and has successfully sent TCP data.\u00a0\n\n    I will provide another update when I receive the modules and being work on the library. I was originally going to write the library for the MSP430 microcontrollers, but it looks like many people who have received their modules are using the Arduino. I might create the library for the Arduino first so that I can get the most amount of people debugging the library. I will eventually port the library to both platforms.\n\n  \u2022 More AT Command Information Found\n\n    bafeigum08\/29\/2014 at 02:28 0 comments\n\n    So looking around on this German forum post about the ESP8266\n\n\n    I saw that somebody translated the Chinese AT command pdf (into German which google than translated into English for me). The translation this person posted had much more information about the chip than I had seen before! I had assumed that the Nurdspace page everybody is probably already very familiar with\n\n\n    was translated from the same document and was all the information we had so I didn't bother taking a look at the actual document in Chinese. It seemed like it would be just BARELY enough to get a good library going, however a lot of information was missing like possible return values and the returned data format. It wouldn't have been impossible to figure this stuff out after getting the chip, but it would have taken longer just poking around.\n\n    Read on to see the translated document and what to expect from the List Access Points Command.\n\n    Read more \u00bb\n\n  \u2022 Two ESP8266 Modules Ordered\n\n    bafeigum08\/27\/2014 at 17:56 0 comments\n\n    I just placed an order for two ESP8266 Modules from AliExpress for $9.50 including free shipping. The processing time is 7 days and the expected shipping time is over 2 weeks. I will be posting the currently available documentation and the translations people have posted soon. I will also create a new GitHub repository to start commiting preliminary code based off of the documentation.",

        "text":"Apple\u2019s iPhone 5 might be the best-selling smartphone in the world, but a new study suggests it is also the \u201cmost hated.\u201d The Daily Mail points us to a study conducted by U.K.-based social media agency\u00a0We Are Social that analyzed chatter on Twitter, blogs and forums following the launches of the iPhone 5, Galaxy S4, Lumia 920 and BlackBerry Z10. After tracking the responses and comparing each of the four devices, the firm found that 20% of the posts discussing the iPhone 5 were complaints. This compares to 18% of posts that complained about the BlackBerry Z10 and 15% that griped about Nokia\u2019s Lumia 920. Just 11% of posts covering the Galaxy S4 were complaints, leading\u00a0We Are Social to conclude that Samsung\u2019s flagship phone is the \u201cmost loved\u201d handset on the market.\n\nAmong the top complaints surrounding Apple\u2019s iPhone 5 launch were the phone\u2019s lack of innovation, its switch from the old 30-pin dock connector to the new lightning port, the poor quality of photos captured on some new iPhones, the black and slate model\u2019s\u00a0tendency\u00a0to scuff and the handset\u2019s terrible new Maps app.\n\nWe Are Social also notes that the iPhone 5 was by far the most talked about smartphone launch. The firm logged 1.7 million social media conversations immediately following the iPhone 5\u2019s debut compared to\u00a0300,000 mentions of BlackBerry\u2019s Z10, 140,000 Galaxy S4 mentions and just 45,000 posts discussing the Lumia 920.\n\n\nView Comments",

        "text":"Electromagnetic Field Probe Version 2\n\n\nAn electromagnetic field probe designed to detect changing electric and magnetic fields. The probe has switchable gain, a frequency response up to 400kHz and independent audio and meter monitoring.\n\nCircuit Notes:\n\nThis EMF probe uses an inductor to locate stray electromagnetic (EM) fields. It will respond to both changing magnetic and electric fields as each will induce a voltage in the inductor. The circuit is built around a quad low noise FET input op-amp, type TL084.\n\nPower supply is a single 9 Volt battery, the supply being divided by R5 and R6. C1 and C2 help smooth variations in battery voltage, S1 is the on off switch. The input stage U1, is direct coupled to the probe, a radial wound 1mH inductor, type Toko 8RB as shown in the probe construction. This part appears only available from Jabdog Electronics in the UK, part number 187LY-102J. If not available then the 1.2, 1.5 or 1.8mH inductor will work equally well. The reactance of the inductor changes with input frequency and stage gain is very high. As there is no offset null control in the TL084 then the output is capacitively coupled via C3 to the next Tl084 amplifier U2. This stage has switchable gain of approximately 1.5x and 4.7x controlled by S2.\n\nThe output gain of both U1 and U2 stages ( with switch S2 open ) is about 70dB at 1KHz. Gain is still about 30dB at 400KHz, although the signal meter will not be too accurate at such high frequency. The bode plot simulated in LTspice is shown below:\n\nThe output from U2 is split by C4 and C5 and drives an independent headphone amplifier built around U4. VR1 acts as a volume control the output being either a mono or stereo miniature jack plug as shown. The output stage of the TL084 is sufficiently low to drive 32 ohm headphones like Sennheiser or Ipod Shuffle, etc. U3 is the meter amplifier. All EMF fields are amplified across the load resistor R8. D1 now acts as a half wave rectifier and creates sufficient DC voltage to drive a small signal meter, shown below.\n\nThis signal meter is available from Maplin Electronics part number LB80B and has a FSD of 250uA and an internal resistance of 675 ohms. However any meter will work having a similar sensitivity. Meters of 100 or 50uA FSD can also be used providing a suitable series resistor is used. Because the circuit is responding to RF frequencies up to several hundred kHz a smoothing capacitor across the meter should not be used as this would appear as an effective short circuit reducing the average current through the meter to zero.\n\nProbe Construction:\n\nThe probe is made from an old pen tube, the end cap being removed. A 50cm length of audio screened cable is threaded through the pen tube and soldered to the radial inductor. The capacitance of 50cm audio cable is about 2pF, longer cable should not be used as high frequency performance will deteriorate.\n\nThe cable may be used with a 3.5mm mono plug and socket if desired. My completed probe is shown below. The diameter of the inductor fitted neatly against the body of the pen tube. A layer of insulating tape or glue may be used to secure the pen body to the inductor.\n\nSimulation Model:\n\nTo model this circuit in LTspice or any other simulator you have to take into account the input capacitance of the probe cable, and the impedance of the inductor itself. The cable capacitance was measured by a capacitance meter and came out at 1.9pF, so 2pF was added in parallel with L2 which is the probe inductor. The simulation schematic is shown below:\n\nThe Toko 8RB inductor has a series resistance of 7 ohms, at 100kHz the impedance is 628.3 ohms. The series resistance of L2 needs to be included, in LTspice the inductor L2 can be right clicked and a value for series resistance entered, or as shown above can be entered in the value of Rs. A transient response at 10kHz is shown below:\n\nThe simulation model has 3 nodes labeled Vgain, Vheadphone and Vmeter for clarity. These waveforms are shown above. The input has been simulated by a signal generator feeding another coil. The coupling coefficient of 0.9 is used and input voltage of 10mV pk-pk used.\n\nDownload Simulation Circuit:\n\nThe simulation circuit for LTspice can be downloaded here. Please note that you will also have to download the model for the potentiometer and TL072 op amp from the LTspice yahoo group. The TL072 simulation model is the same as the TL084 model.\n\n\nIf you have access to an audio or RF signal generator you can apply an input signal to the windings of a small transformer or another inductor. This will set up an electromagnetic field which will be easily detected by the probe. Without a signal generator, just place the probe near a power supply, mains wiring or other electrical device. There will be a deflection on the meter and sound in the headphones if the frequency is below 15KHz.\n\nParts List:\n\nIC1 TL084\nD1 1N4148\nL1 1mH radial inductor part 187LY-102J\nR1 470k\nR2,R5,R6,R7,R9 10k\nR3 22k\nR4 47k\nR8 4k7\nVR1 10k log\nC1,C6,C8 220u\nC2,C4,C5 10u\nC3 1u\nC7 2.2u\nSignal meter 250uA FSD, Maplin LB80B or similar\n\nIn Use\n\nSwitch on, set VR1 to minimum and plug in headphones (optional). The circuit can be built on veroboard and is designed to be portable. Try moving the probe near a light switch or electric socket and a loud hum will be heard in the headphones and meter will deflect.\n\nReturn to Testgear Circuits\n\nContent sourced from Zen Schematics\n\nCircuit: Andy Collinson",
