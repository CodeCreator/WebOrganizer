When I did that, the phone would call voice mail successfully and immediately send the pauses and the password before the Verizon system would ask for it.\n\n    So, I tried another approach. I changed my voice mail calling settings from the *86 to my full phone number followed by the two pauses (commas) and then my 4 digit numeric password.
