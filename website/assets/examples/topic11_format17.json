When I used Flame blast, the box was yellow and it said \u201c3\u201d damage.\n\nasked by\n- Do you mean Flame Burst or Fire Blast?\n- Was this in a double battle?\nCONQUEST, that's the game.\n\n1 Answer\n\n4 votes\n\nAll things considered, Fire Blast should do x2 damage against a Cubchoo, since it doesn't have Thick Fat.\n\nIt might have been holding an Occa Berry, in which case the berry would reduce the damage done by a super effective fire move once, and then the rest of the fire moves will do x2 damage.\n\nEDIT: I just saw what Mew wrote, and that's right.\n\nFlame Burst deals damage. All Pok\u00e9mon (including allies and the user if applicable) adjacent to a Pok\u00e9mon hit by Flame Burst in Double and Triple Battles will lose 1\/16 of their maximum HP in typeless effect damage. This secondary effect will not occur if the target absorbs the primary attack with Flash Fire or the attack misses.\n\nIf it's Flame Burst, it does typeless damage, despite being a fire type move. If it's Flame Burst you're referring to (and not Fire Blast), then that was why it wasn't super-effective against a Cubchoo.\n\n\nanswered by\nedited by\nFlame Burst\nThen it's as Mew suggested; Flame Burst does typeless damage, making Pokemon lose 1\/16 of its health regardless of its type. It would have the same effect on a water Pokemon as it would on an ice Pokemon.",

Once a box is destroyed if there was a mouse inside it will move to a neighbouring box to hide there. If there is no neighbouring box to move to then the mouse will be captured.

It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nAccording to the rules:\n\nAn inquisitor\u2019s alignment must be within one step of her deity\u2019s, along either the law\/chaos axis or the good\/evil axis.\n\nSo what happens when the alignment of an inquisitor changes from lawful good (assuming that is the alignment of his deity) over time to lawful evil (or anything else which is more than one step apart)? Does he lose all his spells? Can he just change his deity? Can he become atheist and still have his spells?\n\nA RAW answer would be great!\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 12 down vote accepted\n\nThe Pathfinder SRD in the Inquisitor article states:\n\nEx-Inquisitors An inquisitor who slips into corruption or changes to a prohibited alignment loses all spells and the judgment ability. She cannot thereafter gain levels as an inquisitor until she atones (see the atonement spell description). An inquisitor who becomes an ex-inquisitor can, with the GM\u2019s permission, take the heretic archetype, replacing her class abilities with the appropriate archetype abilities. If the character atones or joins a different faith, she loses her heretic abilities and regains her previous inquisitor class abilities.\n\nSimply this is the RAW and should contain the necessary answers.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nSomeone must have cast a blindness-deafness spell on me.

It: Make your sims whoohoo go to settings change the language to fran\u00e7ais (YOU MUST HAVE ICLOUD FOR THIS PART) and if somthing pops out tap on the green one then exit settings then turn the language back to english then theres no blur for whoowhooing TRUST ME IT WORKS\nGuest answered:\nAdded 13th Oct 2013, ID #605409\nAll I did to get rid of it was change the language to Spanish (espanol or how ever you spell it ) then DID NOT PRESS THE RED BUTTON press back and it was gone.

Try it!\n\nGuest answered:\nAdded 19th Mar 2014, ID #620169\nSo first you need to have a two-story house. Get the sims to woohoo outside of the house. Then Click the button to go up the house.
