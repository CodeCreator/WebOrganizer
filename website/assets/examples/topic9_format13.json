        "text":"Qatar Financial Centre (QFC), one of the world\u2019s leading and fastest growing onshore business and financial centres, joined a gathering of over 1,000 international leaders from government, business and civil society recently during the World Economic Forum on Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in Jordan.\n\nThe forum serves as a platform to collaborate on some of the most pressing challenges facing the region, while generating progress on the regional agenda for inclusive growth, social advancement and sustainable development.\n\nQFC CEO Yousuf Mohamed Al Jaida\nQFC CEO Yousuf Mohamed Al Jaida\n\nQFC CEO Yousuf Mohamed Al Jaida participated in a panel discussion on the topic, \u2018The Promise of Islamic Finance\u2019, which delved into crucial issues that impact the realisation of the full potential of Islamic finance.\n\nDuring the panel, discussions focused on the growth of Islamic financial sector, which has now surpassed US$1.7 trillion-mark and continues to hit double-digit growth rates, as well as its potential headwinds such as the need for the sector to establish a central authority to distinguish sharia-compliant products. The panel also explored how global standards could be established through public-private cooperation.\n\nAl Jaida said that the principle of Islamic finance embodies the concept of sustainable and inclusive growth. As this becomes a key priority within the economic growth agendas of governments and business entities, Islamic financing will progressively establish itself as the most equitable gateway to financial security.\n\nIslamic finance is a key focus area for both Qatar and QFC. This was reaffirmed in 2018, when Qatar launched the world\u2019s largest single country Islamic exchange traded fund with an initial asset value of US$120 million, and in QFC\u2019s new strategy, which aims to serve the US$2 trillion global Islamic finance market through three core markets \u2013 Turkey, Qatar, and Malaysia.\n\nAs we move towards achieving a sustainable and inclusive economy, QFC will also continue to participate in meaningful dialogues that create opportunities and collaborations in support of this goal.\u2019\n\nQFC is an onshore jurisdiction that allows registered companies to enjoy competitive benefits, such as working within a legal environment based on English common law, the right to trade in any currency, up to 100% foreign ownership, 100% repatriation of profits, 10% corporate tax on locally-sourced profits, and an extensive double taxation avoidance agreement network with over 70 countries.\n\nFor updates and more information about QFC, visit their website at",

The SMART beacon system also allows for instant visual identification of people, places and objects for military, search and rescue, security and civil applications. A $313,919 contract for this innovation was awarded through the CICP.\n\nThe Clustered Beacon System is the world's smallest, most versatile runway lighting system for expeditionary airfields and first-responder helicopter landing zones. Small enough to be carried by a single person, this portable integrated beacon system allows an unprecedented variety of landing field configurations. This pre-qualified innovation was awarded a $321,428 contract through the CICP.\n\n\"Adventure Lights Inc. is very pleased to receive the support of the Government of Canada through this program. The CICP initiative will give our company further recognition and help support our innovative and unique products that have contributed to Canada's economy,\" said Tim Ford, President of Adventure Lights Inc.\n\nLaunched in 2010, the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program has already shown encouraging results, connecting Canadian companies with federal departments and agencies that have a need for innovative products and services. By selling to the federal government, businesses can demonstrate the value of their products and services, and potentially generate future sales to non-federal customers.\n\nTo build on the early success of this program, Economic Action Plan 2012 allocated an additional $95 million to it over three years, starting in 2013-14, and $40 million per year thereafter to make the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program permanent. The program will include an added military procurement component.\n\nFor the complete list of the successful innovations, please refer to the CICP website.\n\nCe texte est \u00e9galement disponible en fran\u00e7ais.\n\nPWGSC news releases are also available on our Internet site at\n\nFollow us on Twitter at\n\nContact Information\n\n  \u2022 Amber Irwin\n    Office of the Honourable Rona Ambrose\n\n    Media Relations\n    Public Works and Government Services Canada",

With its proprietary, user-preferred ad formats and premium publisher relationships, Yieldmo serves more than seven billion mobile impressions per month on behalf of the world\u2019s largest brands and their agencies.\n\n\u201cAs a Publisher, Yieldmo provides a mobile solution to let us create a truly engaging ad experience,\u201d said Victor Lim, Director of Strategy at tronc. \u201cAs we rethink the future of a consumer-first experience on our sites, Yieldmo provides advertising that doesn\u2019t disrupt but instead complements our content.\u201d\n\nEvery month, Yieldmo\u2019s proprietary RaptTM data platform collects 250 billion mobile data attributes from the mobile ads it serves, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 viewers\u2019 taps, scrolls and time spent. Rapt interprets dozens of such micro-interactions to generate an unprecedented level of insight into customer engagement, making campaigns more effective for advertisers and profitable for publishers. Yieldmo viewability and attention metrics are measured through its long-standing relationship with analytics provider, Moat, an Oracle Data Cloud company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely proud of our marketplace,\u201d said Michael Yavonditte, Yieldmo Founder and CEO. \u201cIt provides a rich, fraud-free environment for the ads we serve. The next-level insights Rapt is able to generate from those transactions are also a huge advantage to advertisers and publishers. We\u2019re moving well beyond surface metrics, like impressions, views and clicks, to truly understand the behaviors that lead-to or inhibit conversions. Given the enormity of our scale and experience, Yieldmo is uniquely suited to address that need and ensure that the industry continues to improve for users, brands and publishers in equal measure.\u201d\n\nWith U.S. mobile ad spending estimated to reach $58.4 billion in 2017 (and forecasted to nearly double to $102.3 billion by 2021)2, mobile continues to represent the fastest growing advertising channel in the U.S. However, despite strong projected growth, industry-wide challenges remain, as 44% of publishers rank the poor user experience as the largest challenge facing mobile advertising, second only to ad blocking, which directly results from these poor advertising experiences3. Yieldmo is grounded in a mission to deliver a better ad experience for users, marketers and publishers.\n\n[1] comScore Mobile Ad Network (January 2017)\n[2] eMarketer (March 2017)\n[3] eMarketer (August 2016)\n\n\nFor more information or to see a live demo of Yieldmo\u2019s Rapt capabilities:\nSusan Lietz, +1-917-499-5053",
