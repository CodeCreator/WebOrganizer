Besides getting a whole bunch of cool boards, I made one additional unnecessary purchase: A DIY Digital Oscilloscope Kit.\n\nSee the assembly video here.\n\nMy rating: Medium Difficulty - Not for Beginners, and 5\/5 for Fun!\n\nBuilding an Arduino Temperature Sensor with an LCD Display\n\n\nAs part of my learning curve for open source hardware, and basic electronics.\u00a0 This project wont take you very long, maybe an hour at most.\n\nWhat this does is pretty straight forward, it shows the temperature in real time for both Celsius and Fahrenheit.\u00a0 I\u2019ve added some code to the Nokia, which uses the analogWrite trick (that is, use one of the digital outputs that has a tilde in front of it ( ~ ).\u00a0 This will let you send a modulating frequency, which means you can make the LED (backlight in this case) brighter and dimmer.\u00a0 The brightness of this display is controlled using the trimpot (potentiometer).\n\nMeggy Jr RGB\n\nRecently, a friend introduced me to Arduino.\u00a0 Rather, he\u2019s been trying to introduce me for a while and I\u2019ve just been too darned busy to play with it.\u00a0\n\nSo, I took on some projects and spent some energy on it this last month.\u00a0 As a result, I have a handful of posts coming up about open source hardware :)\n\nFirst up, Meggy Jr from evil mad scientist.\n\nNot really an arduino, it was a great way to warm back up to soldering and electronics.\u00a0 The entire kit took about two hours to assemble, and requires some hand tools as outlined in the manual.\u00a0 I went ahead and picked up a tool kit from SparkFun as my old soldering iron has seen better days \u2013 which is another interesting (albiet expensive) electronics company I have purchased from in the past.\n\nAt the same time, I also purchased an Arduino Esplora + TFT from CanadaRobotix \u2013 but more on that later.\n\nLocalBar2 for BlackBerry 10\n\nFirst, a special thank you to Yohanes who shared his code with me to allow the BB10 port to be built.\n\nI am proud to present a BlackBerry 10 release for LocalBar2!\n\n\n  \u2022 Z10 release\n  \u2022 2 Q10 releases (one scaled, an one shrunk)\n  \u2022 Notifies users on new version release\n  \u2022 Resized graphics\n  \u2022 Added full name fade view on press\n  \u2022 100 items (oh yes)\n  \u2022 6 classes\n  \u2022 60 quests *\n\n* Note: This will make more sense later to some folks.\n\nKnown Bugs:\n\n  \u2022 Closes when miminized\n  \u2022 Slow launch\n  \u2022 Not as aware of BAR success as predecessor\n\n\nSubscribe to this RSS feed\nSubscribe to the official OSBB BBM Channel!\n\n\n\nBack to top",

's access to review units of all of the latest gadgets.\n\nI have been struggling with my gadget addiction for well over 10 years and, according to my wife, the gadgets are winning. Our house has turned into a giant lab for tinkering with new products. We currently have 3 HDTVs (65\", 32\" and 26\"), 4 Windows Media Center PCs, 2 TiVos, 2 Slingboxes (original and AV), an XBOX 360 with HD-DVD add-on, an original XBOX, a Nintendo Wii, 2 Nintendo DS Lites, a 5G iPod, a Windows Home Server with 900GB of storage, a Drobo with 1.3TB of storage, a Harmony 880 remote and a bunch of other stuff that I won't mention, like the subwoofers I have wired to my couch, because actually typing all of that stuff out made me realize that my wife might be onto something.\n\nI am also a frequent beta tester of products and services. Past betas that I've been involved with include XBOX Live and Slingbox.\n\nSo hopefully you will be able to use my \"condition\" to your own benefit as I find out which gadgets are worth buying and which ones should be avoided. I also hope to share some useful tips for getting the most out of the gadgets you already own.\n\nIf there's something you'd like me to cover or you just have a question, send me an e-mail at shawn dot morton at cnet dot com.\n\nEditor's Picks\n\nFree Newsletters, In your Inbox",

Right now I have 4 files, which, when combined, end up taking up about 40 GB. Can I convert the AV500 to NTFS to handle these? I would hate to zip or RAR these into parts. That would be a huge pain...\n15 Jan 2007\n1. When I plug the AV500 into the an outlet it starts up every time. Is that normal? Can I shut it off so that it only charges but stays off?\n\n2. How much time does a full charge take? I've never seen my battery at 100% or the CHG LED fade in and out.\n1 Dec 2006\nHi there everyone\n\nThis is my first post here. I just got a (barely used) AV500 100GB and had a handful of questions.\n\n1. Are there any resources for mods and plugins for this model? I can't seem to turn up anything and I've been looking a fair bit.\n\n2. Is the Root folder supposed to have a folder called DATA in it? Mine doesn't. I thought it was supposed to for things like wallpapers, settings, etc. How can I replace that (If it's supposed to be there)?\n\n3. Within the first 15 minutes of use I discovered that the DC & AV I\/O plug is loose or broken inside. It causes the connection to break between the TV or the charger unless I really fiddle with it. Is this repairable? How responsive is Archos for an RMA and repair?\n\nAny help would great.

It's the same DSP - as far as the drivers are concerned - on both the DX and the DG. In the DX case it's the CMI8788 and on the DG it's the CMI8786, which is the exact same DSP with some features hardlocked. The drivers will identify it as a CMI8788. And support for CMI8788 has been present in the Linux-kernel and in ALSA for quite some time. Linux even adds an Audiphile killer feature over the Windows-drives in the form of the possibility to trim the roll off of the DACs digital filter. Not sure if it's supported on the lower specced CS4361 on DG but it works alright on the CS4398 of the DX. Switching the digital filter to the \"slow roll off\"-mode gives every sound a slight extra lifelike quality :) Also, it's probable that it won't be possible to trim the headphone output impedance on the DG, at least not yet. But it should definitely work as a normal soundcard.\nToggle Commented Nov 9, 2011 on Who Needs a Sound Card, Anyway? at Coding Horror\nXeizo is now following The Typepad Team\nNov 8, 2011",
