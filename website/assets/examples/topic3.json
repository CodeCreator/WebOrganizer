Those familiar with \"the movement\" know exactly what I mean. Anyhow, someone passed along this email today which I felt compelled to share:\n\nDear [So-and-so],\n\nYes, I should be in Houston, Texas the week of February 13th. I am eager to appear by tape or by video-conferencing.\n\nFor me to travel to the DC area, I would insist on all transportation and hotel accommodations being paid, and I'm not willing to travel by scheduled airliner or any other means whereby my privacy would be outraged. A small private plane or a car with driver would be fine with me, and should be arrangeable for less than the cost of a round trip airline ticket. Let me know if you'd like me to help with these arrangements, since I know many private pilots and drivers.\n\nPlease be aware that on Tuesday 20 January 2004 at about 14:30 I was attacked and severely beaten by Houston Police officers. I was handcuffed and kicked in the face repeatedly. As a result of injuries sustained and the refusal of prompt surgical attention, I suffered permanent disfigurement. My nose was broken and my eyebrow cut open, so I am not as physically attractive as some of my photos suggest.\n\n\n[Man less physically attractive than photo would suggest.]",

        "text":"US Department Of Justice Law Enforcement Training Manual Teaches Police That Political Bumper Stickers Are Indications Of Terrorist Activity \u2013 \u201cSpecial Interest\/Single Issue Terrorism\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 A leaked training manual used in the State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training (SLATT) program for law enforcement and funded by the Department of Justice lists political bumper stickers expressing opposition to the United Nations and support for the bill of rights as indications of terrorist activity.\n\nThe presentation documents, leaked to the Public Intelligence website, are entitled Terrorism Training For Law Enforcement and are marked \u201claw enforcement sensitive.\u201d The program is funded by grants from the Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance.\n\nSlides for the presentation depict the kind of behavior that law enforcement officials should be wary of in spotting potential terrorists during highway patrols.\n\nOne of the slides \u2013 entitled \u201cFourth Amendment Issues\u201d \u2013 notes that \u201ca suspicious map located on the passenger seat\u201d could warrant further investigation as a potential indicator of terrorism.\n\nAnother slide entitled \u201cGeneral Right Wing Extremist\u201d \u2013 depicts suspicious bumper stickers that should warrant further investigation by cops conducting traffic stops.\n\nThe bumper stickers read, \u201cKnow Your Rights Or Lose Them,\u201d and \u201cIf You Love Your Country, the U.N. Is Not Your Friend!,\u201d and \u201cGet US Out Of the United Nations\u201d.\n\nUnder the category of \u201cSpecial-Interest\/Single Issue Terrorism,\u201d the slide characterizes people who hold political opinions that \u201crepresent a fairly popular point of view\u201d as terrorists. Anti-abortion activists are also listed as terrorists under this category.\n\nAnother slide lists people who are \u201cantigenetic engineering\u201d as terrorists. Presumably, that includes people who are concerned about a new study which found that rats fed with genetically-engineered Monsanto corn suffered premature deaths.\n\nApparently, the Department of Justice considers Americans who have a good grasp of the bill of rights, are concerned about the food they eat, those who politically oppose the United Nations, and even those who hold \u201cfairly popular\u201d opinions, to be likely terrorists. Perhaps the DOJ is drawing inspiration from the Department of Defense, who in 2009 characterized the First Amendment right to protest as \u201clow level terrorism\u201d.\n\nThese documents are by no means the only instance in which displaying political bumper stickers has been characterized as a suspicious and potentially terrorist activity by the federal government.\n\nThe infamous 2009 MIAC report, published by the Missouri Information Analysis Center and first revealed by Infowars, framed Ron Paul supporters, libertarians, people who display bumper stickers, people who own gold, or even people who fly a U.S. flag, as potential terrorists.\n\nUnder the FBI\u2019s Communities Against Terrorism program, the bulk purchase of food is also labeled as a potential indication of terrorist activity, as is using cash to pay for a cup of coffee, and showing an interest in web privacy when using the Internet in a public place.\n\nA recent Department of Homeland Security-funded study produced by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland characterizes Americans who are \u201csuspicious of centralized federal authority,\u201d and \u201creverent of individual liberty\u201d as \u201cextreme right-wing\u201d terrorists.\n\nGiven that the DHS is now recruiting citizen spies to report \u201csuspicious activity\u201d via apps on their smartphones, don\u2019t be surprised to see SWAT teams being called out to Starbucks on a regular basis to apprehend terrorists who choose to pay for their cup of joe with a few dollar bills.\n\nOne can only imagine what kind of response would be generated by someone paying cash for a cup of coffee whoalso has a political bumper sticker displayed on their car \u2013 the President would obviously have to be immediately notified in order to prepare for the enactment of emergency crisis procedures in order to safeguard national security.\n\nAppeared Here\n\n\nComments are closed.\n\n%d bloggers like this:",

        "text":"Police file \u2013 George Stevens \u2013 21st October 1890\n\n\nThe Police File\n\n21st October 1890\n\nThe Commissioner of Police\n\nGeorge Braithwaite Phillips \u2013 Commissioner of Police\nWhy, after only four weeks did the Commissioner threaten Stevens\u2019 investigations by signing a telegram to Stevens \u201cCommissioner of Police?\u201d He was effectively blowing Stevens\u2019 cover. Was he hoping this would end the investigation? The aforesaid telegram dated the 21st September 1890 was not found in the police file. Why did the Commissioner threaten Stevens with obtaining money under false pretences? A most serious accusation. Stevens was adamant that the Commissioner had broken their agreement. A report would have been forthcoming after eight weeks as previously agreed. Was pressure being bought to bear on the Commissioner from some other powers? Were others aware of Stevens\u2019 appointment? Were they afraid of what he may find?\n\n\nI have been waiting for an answer to my last telegram to you but no having received answer I am proceeding by the \u201cSouth Australian\u201d today.\n\nI must confess I was very much surprised at your last wire to me and if the matter on which I came here has not come to a completely successful issue you have no one to blame but yourself.\n\nWhen we had the first interview on this matter it was distinctly understood that no communication was to come from the Police Department direct but through the Colonial Secretary. This again was mentioned on Sunday morning when you gave me the code to use [?] telegraphing and again on the day before my departure yet on Sunday the 21st ulto you wired to me signing your name as Commissioner of Police. This telegram coming on a Sunday evening especially aroused suspicion and was handed to me just as I was trying to get some information from one of two men who had only arrived in Roebourne that day and whom I had good reason to suspect knew more about the matter than he would like to tell not expecting this telegram was from you I opened it and they naturally asked if anything was wrong of course I said no but next morning it was said in the town that I had had a telegram from the Commissioner of Police.\n\nThe reason why you received no letter from me was simply this. That I was doing my best and was out of town trying to get up evidence. I was trying to find out why Anketell went to the Pyramid [Station] and being too late to write I did not care to wire on account of the telegram you had sent me as I did not want to cause any more suspicion.\n\nI was doing my best in the only way a man who know his business as a detective can do and had I been left alone instead of being thwarted by you the matter would have come to a successful issue.\n\nYour last telegram to me was most ill advised to use misguided term your agreement with me was for two months at \u00a312-\/10\/- per week and until the two months were up you had no right to expect any report from me as to whether I had succeeded or not but your telegram to me shows how little you know of detecting business.\n\nMy terms were these \u00a312-\/10\/- per week. [?] 8 weeks passage paid to and from. I arrived in Roebourne on the 29th August last and I left on the 21st inst (actually landing in Cossack on the 28th August and left on the 21st next makes in all 7 weeks and 4 days. I would have stopped longer but I told you in my last wire that I would proceed no further until I heard from you.\n\nI have received in all \u00a370 but you have to pay my passage money to and from and upon receipt of the balance I will give you my report and return you the ticket as a special detective. I must ask for this money to be sent to me direct and not through a bank. You cannot blame me for the course I am now taking as you have threatened me with attaining money under false pretences. Had you waited till the two months had elapsed the whole matter would have been cleared up. Please excuse writing as I am writing on board the steamer and intend posting when I arrive in Fremantle.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo J. Malcom Stevens",

The suspect fled on foot.\n\nDetectives say the security guard was walking through the parking structure on a regular round to check for safety concerns and encountered a male who appeared to be rifling through vehicles. The man was observed removing property from one of them.\n\nThe security guard confronted the man and questioned his actions, detectives say. When he attempted to leave, the guard ordered him to stay.\n\nThe man pulled out a handgun and pointed it toward the security officer, firing one shot before fleeing on foot.\n\nThe security guard has since been treated and released from the hospital.\n\nPolice were on scene along Lafayette Avenue for much of the night investigating, Lt. Scott Weitzel said early Monday.\n\nThe ramp is the same one where a nurse was stabbed in a domestic situation as she walked to her vehicle in March. The suspect was not known to her, but was known to another person involved in a conflict with her, police said.\n\nThere are security cameras in the parking ramp.\n\nSpectrum Health, in a brief statement released after Sunday night's shooting, said the security guard is recovering.\n\n\"There was an incident outside of Parking Ramp 7 late in the evening on June 22 on the Grand Rapids Medical Center campus. A Spectrum Health security guard was assaulted. He received treatment for his injuries and has been released. Spectrum Health Security Services will continue to work with the Grand Rapids Police Department in the investigation. Access to the parking lot entrances and exits has been restored.\"\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Grand Rapids police at 456-3604 or Silent Observer at 774-2345.",
