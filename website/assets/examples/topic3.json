But this isn't the first time that a spine-chilling crime involving a celebrity from the entertainment industry has made headlines.\n\nHere are some other cases involving Bollywood and TV celebrities:\n\nNeeraj Grover murder case\n\nGrover who was a television executive working for Synergy Adlabs was murdered in 2008. After investigations, it was revealed that a small-time actress Maria Susairaj along with her lover, naval officer Emile Jerome Mathew had murdered Neeraj.\n\nApparently Neeraj was helping Maria land roles in television soaps, besides shifting to a new house.\n\nMathew who was Susairaj's fiancee, suspected that Neeraj was living with her which infuriated him. He ended up stabbing Neeraj with a knife from Maria's kitchen. Later the betrothed couple allegedly hacked his body to pieces, packed it in a bag and set fire to it.\n\nGulshan Kumar murder case\n\nThe T-series music baron and film producer Gulshan Kumar was shot dead in broad daylight outside an Andheri temple by two men who pumped numerous bullets into his body.\n\nNadeem, of the popular music composer duo Nadeem-Shravan, was accused of plotting the murder. After investigations the Mumbai Police Crime Branch alleged that Nadeem had planned the murder in Dubai with Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim Kaskar. Nadeem presently resides in London.\n\nBrij Sadanah killing spree and suicide\n\nKamal Sadanah's (Bollywood actor) father Brij Sadanah, who was a successful filmmaker in the 1970s, killed his wife and daughter in a fit of rage at their Bandra residence in Mumbai .\n\nKamal was also shot at but he survived. The father then committed suicide on the same night. This entire episode sadly took place on Kamal Sadanah's birthday, when the entire family was wiped out.\n\nSandhya Singh murder case\n\nSandhya Singh who was the sister of Bollywood music composers duo Jatin-Lalit had gone missing in December 2012. Days later her body was found in the marshes in Navi Mumbai, close to her residence.\n\nAfter investigations, it was discovered that her son Raghuveer was behind the murder and was arrested. He used to have frequent fights with his mother and was also a drug addict.\n\nDivya Bharti's 'controversial' death\n\nKnown Bollywood actress and model Divya Bharti who was married to producer Sajid Nadiadwala, fell to her death from her five-story apartment building in Versova, Mumbai in 1993.\n\nFollowing her death there was much speculation by the media regarding Bharti's sudden demise, including the possibility of accidental death, conspiracy and even murder.\n\nEven after the investigations, the Mumbai Police failed to find any evidence against Nadiadwala. He was never charged for murder and the case was closed in 1998, labelling it as an accidental death.\n\nFirst published: 7 September 2015, 10:30 IST\nRaza Naqvi @Mir_Naqvi\n\nRaza is an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) and has worked with the Hindustan Times in the past.

According to a report in the New York Daily News, the driver of a late-model four-door silver sedan was southbound on Central Avenue in Bushwick when he struck the bicyclist who was eastbound on George Street. The driver failed to stop and render aid to the victim. The injured victim was then rushed to a local hospital where he remains in critical condition. Police are still attempting to locate the hit-and-run driver. The victim was apparently a construction worker, who was well known for the bicycles he built on the side.\n\nHit-and-Run Collisions\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) reports that one out of every 10 crashes (about 11 percent) reported to the police involves a hit-and-run driver. Also, most hit-and-run crashes result in catastrophic injuries or even fatalities. Between the years 1994 and 2003, 14,914 people were killed in hit-and-run collisions, the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety reported.\n\nNew York Hit-and-Run Law\n\nUnder New York Statute 600.2: \u201cAny person operating a motor vehicle who, knowing or having cause to know that personal injury has been caused to another person, due to an incident involving the motor vehicle operated by such person shall, before leaving the place where the said personal injury occurred, stop, exchange information and contact the authorities.\u201d\n\nCompensation for Hit-and-Run Victims\n\nInjured victims of hit-and-run accidents are often left struggling to pay their medical bills and other expenses associated with their losses. When the hit-and-run driver is not found, victims can seek compensation through the uninsured motorist clause of their auto insurance policies or through a quasi-state agency if there is no motor vehicle in the victim\u2019s household. This applies even to cases where the at-fault driver is uninsured or underinsured. In some incidents, bicyclists or pedestrians may be able to file a claim against the city or governmental agency, if a dangerous or defective roadway is found to have caused or contributed to their injuries.\n\nIf you or a loved one has been injured or if you have lost a loved one in a hit-and-run accident, the experienced New York personal injury attorneys at the Law Offices of Kenneth A. Wilhelm can help you better understand your legal rights and options. We obtained $2,000,000 for a 6-year-old girl who was injured by a hit-and-run driver.

        "text":"Akriti Khatri is on a stakeout in a bustling neighborhood in New Delhi. On this hot Sunday afternoon in August, shoppers are bargaining for clothes and household goods at open-front stores. Khatri buys a watermelon smoothie from a juice vendor and tucks herself against a wall to avoid the cars and motorized rickshaws clogging the street. The chaotic location is ideal. \"It's easy to blend in and secretly watch my target,\" says Khatri, a private detective whose eyes, hidden behind sunglasses and a curly dark bob, are fixed on a nearby modern apartment block. \"With luck, I will catch the love cheat on-camera coming out of the building with his mistress.\"\n\nKhatri, 31, who exudes a mixture of fearless energy and sharp humor, is one of a growing number of Indian women taking the country's male-dominated private-eye industry by storm. She runs her own agency, Venus Detective, with offices in India's capital, Delhi; Bangalore; and three other major cities. The sleuth and her team of 20 full-time, mostly female field agents launch daring undercover operations to expose illicit love affairs, dating fraud, corporate corruption, and other ills of modern Indian society. In the process, they turn traditional female roles upside down. \"We often disguise ourselves as maids, vegetable vendors, college girls, or cosmetics saleswomen to infiltrate homes and offices,\" says Khatri, who rides a motor scooter during surveillance jobs. \"It's risky, but so far we've never been caught. Targets rarely suspect women of being professional spies.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nDelhi-born Khatri opened Venus Detective in 2011 after learning the trade at another P.I. firm straight after college. A science graduate with an MBA, she was drawn to the profession \"out of sheer curiosity,\" she says. \"I always loved collecting information about people. It was like a hobby. When I was a student, it took me 30 minutes to get across campus because I stopped to get the gossip from everyone I met.\" Dubbed \"Delhi's Nancy Drew\" by national newspaper the Hindustan Times, Khatri has seen demand for her services boom as the country modernizes at a breakneck pace. She receives 80 to 100 calls a week, mostly about matters relating to love and marriage.\n\nTanya Puri, 23, is the youngest P.I. in the country to run her own agency, Lady Detectives India, located in a suburb of Delhi\nJack Picone\n\nMany of Khatri's clients are women who want to find out if their partners are cheating on them, or are keen to know if a prospective husband has any hidden deal-breaking habits. \"Indian women are becoming much more independent with their own jobs and social lives, especially in big cities,\" she says. \"They don't tolerate men who deceive them or who don't meet their expectations.\" Her client today, a woman in her late 20s who suspects her advertising- executive husband is having an affair with a colleague, is typical. The woman's husband has started coming home late and always taking his smartphone to the bathroom. \"She has a young child, but she says she'd rather be a single mom than put up with an unfaithful husband,\" says Khatri. \"This view was unheard of in my mother's generation.\"\n\nHiring a private detective not only empowers women to take control of their lives, she adds, it also helps them to avoid mistakes in the first place. Two female clients broke up with their respective boyfriends after Khatri discovered that one man's math was so bad, he couldn't count banknotes, and the other had lied about his family home having an indoor toilet (as she learned when she pretended to be lost in the neighborhood and asked to use it).\n\nFor centuries, arranged marriages have been the norm in India, with each partner vetted by family members and local connections. The role of informal detective was often taken by barbers who traveled from village to village, gathering intel about a person's suitability while cutting hair. \"They'd find out whether the bride was respectable, whether the groom was financially stable, and whether both came from decent families,\" says Khatri. But now, with couples increasingly meeting on Facebook and Instagram and on dating apps like Tinder, the demand for private detectives is skyrocketing. (There are no formal figures for the growth in investigative agencies, but India's Association of Private Detectives and Investigators [APDI] says it counts around 350 firms as members, up from fewer than 20 a decade ago.) The Internet has created \"relationship chaos\" in the country of almost 1.3 billion people, Khatri says, causing far greater shock waves than in, say, the U.S., owing to India's deeply traditional attitudes. \"People are falling for strangers online who often make up tall stories about their identities or credentials,\" she says. \"There's much more uncertainty and confusion, as well as conflict with older generations who don't like their children's choices.\" Extramarital affairs, too, are on the rise because of the ease of dating and messaging apps. \"Love in modern India has become a war zone.\"\n\nFees for Khatri's investigations run from around 25,000 rupees ($380) for a premarital check, which takes about 10 days, up to 500,000 rupees ($7,500) for complex cases that can span months, like corporate fraud or missing persons. Because private investigation is not a legally recognized profession in India\u2014the authorities tolerate such work as long as detectives don't break any laws, such as illegally obtaining phone or e-mail records\u2014there are no identifying signs outside her office. Most clients find her via her website and newspaper advertisements.\n\n\"Love in modern India has become a war zone.\"\n\nVenus Detective's headquarters are on the third floor of a smart- looking office building in a business park in Noida, an industrial- corporate \"mini-city\" on the outskirts of the capital. In the large, airy room, Khatri's youthful team of admin and technical staff wear preppy shirts and casual pants or dresses and sit in cubicles taking calls and monitoring investigations on laptops. \"Everything is digital these days,\" Khatri says. \"To protect our clients' privacy, we don't keep any physical evidence lying around.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nThere's rarely any shortage of evidence. In around 40 to 50 percent of premarital cases, for example, the person Khatri is investigating has invented or concealed personal details\u2014in the rush to join India's increasingly prosperous middle class, it's tempting to fake a few things to meet the right spouse. In infidelity cases, there are practical reasons to have hard evidence of wrongdoing. \"In an arranged marriage, families on both sides are involved, and it's difficult to divorce or separate without causing a major dispute,\" she explains. \"But if the client can say, 'My partner has been unfaithful and here are the photos and hotel receipts to prove it,' the families cannot argue with them.\"\n\nSome also lie about their caste, India's ancient social hierarchy rooted in the Hindu religion. \"Caste is critical to some traditional families,\" Khatri says. \"I get many calls from parents who are worried their offspring are dating someone from a lower caste. Even if the couple is deeply in love, the family will stop at nothing to break up the romance.\" Parents ask Khatri to snare their child's partner in a \"honey trap\" to make it look like they are double-dating, or to fabricate evidence of a partner's unsuitability. \"I always refuse,\" she says. \"I draw the line at anything unethical.\"\n\nOthers deceive on a much grander scale. Khatri and her staff call these \"OMG\" cases. A recent example involved an Indian couple based in America. \"The wife hired me to find out why her husband was spending so long back in India,\" she says. \"We discovered he had three other wives in this country, each with their own house and kids that he'd fathered.\" In another OMG case, a Delhi woman wanted to know why her live-in boyfriend kept sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night. \"He told her he couldn't sleep and was getting fresh air,\" says Khatri. \"It turned out he was hiring out his sexual services for cash to an older woman in the neighborhood two or three times a week.\"\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Khatri, who is married with a 2-year-old son, says a big part of her job is counseling distressed clients. \"One of the first things I ask people is whether they're prepared to learn the truth and what they intend to do with the information we dig up,\" she says. Sometimes the answers surprise her, like the woman who hired her but planned to do nothing with the proof of her husband's infidelity. \"She was just going to keep it as insurance,\" Khatri says, \"in case her husband caught her cheating on him.\"\n\nConfirmation that a spouse has been having an affair doesn't always end badly. One of Khatri's clients, a 30-year-old Delhi resident named Shweta who does not want her last name published, says hiring a private detective saved her 5-year-old marriage, at least for now. After the birth of their first child, Shweta and her husband stopped communicating, and as the distance between them grew, she began to suspect he was seeing someone. \"I hired Akriti, and she caught him red-handed checking in to a hotel with another woman,\" she says. \"When I confronted him with the evidence, he broke down and apologized. He has treated me like a queen ever since.\"\n\nBeing unfaithful works both ways, of course, and growing numbers of Khatri's clients are men who want to check up on their wives and girlfriends. Whatever the gender of her clients, she believes female private detectives have the upper hand. \"Women feel more comfortable telling their problems to another woman,\" she says, \"while men think that I will understand the mind-set and behavior of their wives.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\"Women make excellent investigators, in many cases far superior to men.\"\n\nBaldev Puri, general secretary of the Delhi chapter of the APDI, agrees...

It\u2019s unclear if more rounds were fired. A second officer on the scene, an eight-year veteran, did not fire his weapon.\n\nIn the 911 call, no vocal exchange could be heard between the homeowner and officer who fired his weapon. Riddle and Taylor said it was still unclear whether the officer gave any verbal commands to the homeowner.\n\nWilliams\u2019 handgun was recovered from the home, but there was no indication that Williams raised his weapon, fired his weapon or brandished it in a threatening way.\n\n\nPolice were told that the suspect was driving a black Nissan Sentra, which was actually still sitting in the driveway with the door open and the interior lights on, when they pulled up.\n\nWilliams, who is still recovering at a local hospital and is expected to survive, has not spoken to the media or police.\n\nBut police are already saying he confused the cops for the suspect \u2013 even though he has not said this \u2013 in an obvious attempt to justify the shooting.\n\nThey also chalk up the shooting to the old \u201csplit-second decision\u201d that cops must make do when confronting citizens.\n\nBelow is a recording of the dispatch communications.\n\n\n\nMore in Keystone Kops",

Your name, home address, social security number, credit information, account balances - everything - is now sitting on a computer in Belarus, with the information being hocked for sale on a half a dozen websites. Perhaps thousands of dollars of fraudulent charges have been added to your account. Maybe even a new credit card has been issued in your name to an address in Saskatchewan.\n\nYou order a credit report, and put yourself on a credit fraud watch list. You pay for a service to inform you whenever there has been any extension of credit in your name. You call all your credit card issuers and get new credit cards. You cancel all automatic payments on your credit cards, including all your online purchases where your card is stored (such as Amazon and PayPal) and give them your new numbers.\n\nDozens of hours later, you may or may not have corrected some of the problems created by your lender's failure to protect your data. Finally, you go to your lawyer, and ask the dumbest question you can ever ask a lawyer: \"can I sue?\" Of course, the answer is always \"yes.\" But the bigger question is, will you win? A recent case from Minnesota (PDF) raises the question of what the duty is of a regulated entity such as this to actually protect their customer's data.\n\nA recent case\n\nStacy Guin had a student loan with Brazos Higher Education Service Corporation. Brazos employed a financial analyst to review its loan portfolio and decide which loans to buy and sell. The financial analyst worked from his house in Maryland, and had files related to as many as 550,000 of these loans on his laptop at home. Stop me if you have heard this before, or can anticipate what comes next. Of course, the analyst's house was burglarized, and the unencrypted files were stolen.\n\nBrazos then sent out what I call the \"Otter\" letter. In the movie Animal House, some frat boys borrow and destroy Kent \"Flounder\" Dorfman's brother's car. Tim Matheson's character, Eric \"Otter\" Stratton, consoling his fraternity brother, utters the immortal words of faith, \"You F&^#ed Up - You Trusted Us.\" This is exactly the sort of letter that Brazos sent to its customers like Stacy Guin.\n\nBrazos did take other remedial measures. They notified all 550,000 customers of the potential breach. They told customers that they could put a free 90 day security alert on their credit files, and established a call center to track ID theft. Indeed, there were no reported incidents of credit or identity fraud resulting from the stolen laptop, and no evidence that Stay Guin's credit or identity were misused. In fact, what probably happened is that somebody in Silver Spring has themselves a brand new laptop, and never even noticed or used the data that was inside. Nevertheless, Stacy Guin decided to sue Brazos for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.\n\nFTC data protection guidelines\n\nBrazos, as a lender, is a financial institution and therefore regulated in the U.S. under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA), 15 USC 6801. The GLBA Security Guidelines require regulated entities to,\n\n\"establish appropriate standards for the financial institutions subject to their jurisdiction relating to administrative, technical, and physical safeguards-\n\n(1) to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information;\n(2) to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records; and\n(3) to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.\n\nThe Security Guidelines issued pursuant to the GLBA, 16 CFR 314.4(a)-(c) mandates that financial institutions develop computer security programs, identify foreseeable risks to consumer information, and put in place measures to monitor and reduce the risk of such programs.\n\nOf course, Brazos had a security program, a written security policy, risk assessment reports, and what the court termed \"proper safeguards for its customers' personal information\" according to an affidavit prepared by a defense expert. Brazos determined that their analyst needed to have access to the information for Brazos' business purpose, and that this was acceptable to Brazos under its security program. What Brazos failed to do, however, was to actually prevent the information from being compromised.\n\nWhat is \"reasonable?\"\n\nIn order to prevail, Guin had to show that the loan company owed him a duty to protect his information, that the theft of the laptop was reasonably foreseeable, and that Brazos failed to take reasonable efforts to prevent the loss of the data. Guinn would also have to show that this failure was the legal cause of some damage or injury.\n\nThe standard of care for the prevention of harm is typically what the law calls the \"reasonable man\" standard. What would a reasonable person (or company) of ordinary prudence do? In addition, laws or regulations can impose a higher standard of care than ordinary negligence, and failure to adhere to a law or regulation is typically deemed to be negligence per se. So, what would a \"reasonable\" holder of personal information have done?\n\nStory continued on Page 2\u00a0\n\nMark D.
