        "text":"In Their Own Words\n\nRaz ParnafesOne of our former CITs, who is a Jewish Israeli, gave a speech in which she discussed an act as simple as walking down the street.\u00a0 An act complicated, however, by the fact that she walked with her Arab friend and by the fact that they were among Israeli soldiers. Raz, a young Jewish woman, sees these soldiers and feels protected.\u00a0 Yasmeen, one of her best friends, a young Arab woman, sees them and feels fear creeping up, feels uncomfortable and scared. In the same moment in which Raz and Yasmeen display their friendship, their differences are made very clear.\u00a0 Yet they make it work: through their mutual determination to understand the other, a once far-off perspective is now fathomable to each of the young women. In the video above, Yasmeen speaks of the changes she and her peers in Ultimate Peace have experienced.\u00a0 Prior to her time with Ultimate Peace, peace in the Middle East had always seemed unfathomable to her; however, her experience in Ultimate Peace has given her hope that change is possible. She knows that it is up to her generation to not only embrace but to facilitate change, and she and her peers take every opportunity to push for it.\n\nAli AwwadAli has been a member of Ultimate Peace since the beginning.\u00a0 He showed up to camp in 2010 as a young boy eager to learn a new sport, get some energy out, and as he\u2019s said many times and which we\u2019ll never let him forget, \u201cfor the girls.\u201d\u00a0 Now, in 2015, Ali has turned into a national team Ultimate player, and a strong advocate for cross cultural friendships and peace-building in the Middle East.\u00a0 In his journey to becoming the well-spoken young man we see in this video, he has met and become close with many others \u2013 those who identify as Arab-Israeli as he does, as well as those who identify as Israeli Jews or Palestinians.\u00a0 Through Ultimate Peace, he has formed relationships that rely on the common interests of sport, peace, or (of course) girls rather than culture and religion.\u00a0 As you\u2019ll see in this video, Ali recognizes that the conflict of the Middle East is more than fact: each individual on each side has a story, which cannot be invalidated. His wisdom and eloquence come from his recognition and understanding of these stories, and they are reflected in so many other young leaders of Ultimate Peace.\n\nYonatan Ben HaimThe transformation we have seen in Yonatan, better known by his nickname Yabi, reflects the ideals of Ultimate Peace: he has changed from a boy simply interested in summer camp to an eloquent, ambitious, independent young man with visions for a more peaceful future.\u00a0 Visions, I might add, that he knows how to accomplish.\u00a0 As he says in this video, when he first came to camp it was simply a camp, but now Ultimate Peace has become a part of his identity.\u00a0 Last year, the remarkable young man who had begun as a shy yet spirited player, single-handedly added the community of Herzliya to Ultimate Peace. He saw that more communities were needed and he acted.\u00a0 This kind of leadership is what we hope to see in the CIT program, and now a graduate, Yabi has shown nothing but growth, confidence, desire for improvement, and an undying commitment to the bettering of the organization and the region.\n\n\u201dYou know, I think UP is going to be known all around the world in the next few years for doing something that no one else is doing, because it really, really works.\u201d\n\u2013 Amir Barkan, Age 13",

The specific nature of the work of the purchasing department is cyclical and is determined by the terms of the marketing year for each crop.\n\nThe company\u2019s continuous dialogue with grain producers is carried out by 35 traders who provide an individual approach to each supplier.\n\nWe offer our clients a full range of services in the analysis, reception, storage, refining and logistics of the crop. Thanks to many years of experience in the industry, we have professionally studied the specifics \u2013 the classification, qualitative indicators, price affecting factors for each commodity we work with.\n\nWe provide the competitive prices for the purchase of grain and oilseeds on the basis of daily thorough and comprehensive analysis of the current situation on the domestic grain market, the proposals of international grain traders, complex forecasts for the development of the industry.\n\nOur principle of cooperation with suppliers is based on the understanding that everyone should do his own thing \u2013 a farmer should grow, a trader should buy and sell.\n\nThe technical basis for the company\u2019s trading activities is its own warehousing \u2013 a network of grain silos in Ukraine, a fleet of grain carriers with various carrying capacity.\n\nDue to own developed infrastructure, we cooperate with grain producers almost throughout the whole Ukraine.\n\nThe financial basis of trading activities is 99% of the company\u2019s own funds. Due to the financial independence of Prometey, in most cases, we carry out 100% prepayment for the goods, which gives us advantagecompared to competitors on the market.\n\nThe company does not work with intermediaries; thanks to this, Prometey offers only a proven product with a quality guarantee to its customers.\n\nThe main trading office of the company is in Nikolaev. A trading office was also opened in Kirovograd in November 2015.",

        "text":"About the UsefulBible website\n\nDear Friends and Dear Readers,\n\nLet me invite you to study the Bible with us at usefulbible.com. We have more than 1500 articles for you to read, and several books that you can download freely.\n\nOur particular subject is what the original authors of the Bible believed. Our method is to study a whole Bible book, and every verse of that book in turn. However, if your time is short, you can turn to any article and read our notes on it.\n\nPeople across the world read our articles, and they differ much, both in their knowledge of the Bible and of the English language. We try hard to make our articles useful to everyone who uses the website. For that reason, all our articles are in EasyEnglish, a simple English system that Wycliffe Associates UK \/ MissionAssist UK designed, with a 2800 word vocabulary. For the benefit of those readers with a good knowledge of the Bible, we give plenty of Bible references. In that way, these studies can be the beginning of a much deeper study of the subjects.\n\nPerhaps it may interest you to know how this work began. Back in 2003, I was the speaker at a church meeting locally. The leader of that meeting was my good friend, Professor Barrie Wetherill, who set up Wycliffe Associates in the UK. Before the meeting, he spoke to me about the EasyEnglish Bible commentaries (books to explain the Bible) that they were writing to assist the work of Bible translation across the world. They needed people with skills like mine, and soon afterwards, I became one of their authors, then the leader of their commentary team.\n\nI was pleased to do that work for several years. However, I wanted to provided my readers with articles that would help them to study the Bible in more detail. That was why, in 2010, I set up usefulbible.com.\n\nIt is very wonderful to share these Bible studies with so many people across the world. However, it will be even more wonderful if, by them, you will learn to know God better and to trust him more. May the God of the Bible teach you through his own precious word!\n\nKeith Simons\n\nPlease write to me if you wish to tell me your opinions about any of the articles, or your experiences with the website. Please mention your country, and if you represent a church. Email: office3@usefulbible.com",
