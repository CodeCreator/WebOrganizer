        "text":"History of Brockville Arts Centre\n\nFrom the beginning\n\n1858 \u2013 The present Brockville Arts Centre on King Street West is built to serve as a town hall, market place and fire engine house. (Two of the original date stones still exist placed on the outside wall).\n\n1880 \u2013 The town hall is moved to a new location allowing for the creation of Brockville\u2019s first real theatre called The Opera House.\n\n1911 \u2013 The building is expanded creating a tall fly tower, spacious dressing rooms and the third largest stage in Canada. The Opera House is renamed New Theatre.\n\n1929 \u2013 New Theatre closes due to declining revenues. The theatre remains \u201cdark\u201d through much of the so called \u201cdirty thirties\u201d.\n\n1937 \u2013 Fire destroys the auditorium. Fortunately, the proscenium\u2019s asbestos curtain saves the huge stage, backstage area and fly tower.\n\n1939 \u2013 The renovated building reopens as a motion-picture theatre called The Regent.\n\n1958 \u2013 The rising popularity of television forces the closure of The Regent. (Today, in the projection booth the two 35 milimetre film projectors continue to function and are used for special screenings).\n\n1960 \u2013 The building reopens as Brockville\u2019s Civic Auditorium offering a venue for local theatre groups and professional touring companies.\n\n1975 \u2013 The Civic Auditorium is renovated including an expansion to accommodate a lobby art gallery and box office.\n\n1981 \u2013 The rear of the building is expanded for rehearsal space, set construction, prop and wardrobe storage.\n\n1990 \u2013 The building is renamed Brockville Arts Centre.\n\n2009 \u2013 Project ENCORE! \u2013 a community-driven undertaking, restores and redecorates the theatre under the direction of Designer Peggy Irvine.\n\nFacebook Posts\n\nThis message is only visible to admins.\n\nPPCA Error: Due to Facebook API changes it is no longer possible to display a feed from a Facebook Page you are not an admin of.

From day one, we\u2019ve fought to tear down the walls erected by the music industry. And we won. Each day, we strive to give independent artists and labels access to the marketplace so they can compete on equal footing and build the lives they deserve.\n\nOur mission is to be heroes for DIY musicians and independent record labels around the world. We want to make it easy for everyone to sell, manage, protect, and monetize their music. If you\u2019re financially sustainable, you\u2019ll make more music. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nmusic startup in brainstorming session\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Members\n\nBy musicians, for musicians\n\n20 years ago, we were electronic musicians starting our own record label. After finding our own way as artists, we founded iMusician to help our friends easily maneuver the music industry. Over the last 20 years, we fought for artists\u2019 rights and our dream evolved into a thriving community of more than 200,000 DIY artists and independent record labels.\n\nOur evolution happened as physical record sales were plummeting and digital stores and streaming platforms started to pop up. We grew with it, and now we\u2019re well equipped to navigate the music industry and whatever comes next.\n\n\nAs successful artist Greed, Tobi Wirz founds dance music imprint SOGrecords at the height of the Progressive House craze.\n\n\nIn the US, industry sales of CDs peak with 942.5 million units sold. (source)\n\n\nShigs Amemiya joins SOGrecords as a label manager.\n\n\nFrom a windowless attic studio, SOGrecords doubles output and branches into publishing, booking, and management. Apple launches iTunes store; Beatport opens digital store focused on dance music.\n\n\nYouTube, Spotify, Deezer, and Amazon Music spring up.\n\n\nShigs Amemiya and Tobias Wirz launch iMusician in English, French, and German to give independent artists and labels equal access. Majors start blocking iMD from The Official Swiss Charts.\n\n\niMusician leads a class action \"anti-competition case\" against the IFPI and the Majors in Switzerland. In 2012, we win, with the court forcing the IFPI to open the charts to all independents.\n\n\niMusician jumps from 10,000 to 25,000 members, rolls out YouTube Monetization, launches in Spanish and Italian, and opens an office in Berlin, Germany.\n\n\niMusician launches in Brazil and Portugal, quietly reaches 100,000 members. CD sales hit all-time low with only 46.5 million units sold globally. In the US, streaming takes 80% of digital sales.\n\n\niMusician reaches 200,000 members and launches Instant Mastering.\n\nOur values\n\nWe grow with you\n\nWe know that it\u2019s hard for musicians to find the information and access they need; the music industry creates veils of mystery. But we want to help you move forward. It doesn\u2019t matter if you went to Music School or have an MBA; anyone can have a successful and sustainable music career.\n\nWe walk the walk\n\nWe know that financial sustainability in the music doesn\u2019t happen overnight; dreams are paved with a lot of hard work and consistent steps towards goals, one release at a time. We want to help artists and labels meet their goals by giving them solutions they can use every day and advice they can apply towards their own path. We are solution-oriented, aware of the changes that have happened to the industry, and offer realistic and up-to-date advice.\n\nWe cut the hype\n\nWe know that the music industry uses hype to create illusion, fantasy, dreams, and failure. We lift the veils to give musicians what they need to make a living from their music. Our team is made up of musicians, record labels managers, DJs, tour managers, and more. We use this experience to create services that make it easier for DIY musicians and independent labels can use to build a sustainable business.\n\nWe are a global community\n\nAt iMusician, we believe in the power of a unified global community.

He\u2019s got the muscles to back up his mouth, but deep down he\u2019s a softy. If you\u2019re having trouble with creating a workout routine, Clements would be more than happy to help. He really is a stand-up guy.\n\n\nJohn CleganeJohn CleganeNicknamed, \u201cThe Peninsula\u201d, John Clegane is the guy to go to if you have any male enhancement related questions. He\u2019s not afraid to admit that he uses male enhancement pills, because he knows how outright effective they are. If a man like Clegane can use them without shame, then so can you.\n\nColt PowersColt Powers \u2013 When Colt Powers isn\u2019t dreaming of starring in 80s action movies (Come on, how can you not with that name?), he\u2019s working on his efficiency in the gym. He\u2019s a great guy to workout with, since he knows his stuff, as long as you\u2019re okay with one-liners that don\u2019t even relate to the situation. \u201cHey man\u2026. You need to chill out.\u201d Oh, Colt \u2013 never change.\n\n\nBruce RandolphBruce Randolph \u2013 Bruce is the kind of guy who is gonna let you know if your form is wrong. Now, that might seem kind of pretentious, but he\u2019s really just lookin\u2019 out for you.\u00a0 He\u2019s constantly trying to improve his technique, and he\u2019ll stop at nothing until he\u2019s perfected his workouts.\n\n\nRon SwinsonRon Swinson \u2013 Ron Swinson is the man of mans. He\u2019s the man that every man wants to be. Fully bearded and jacked to the extreme, Swinson could probably rip a tree trunk out of the ground if he really tried. If there was a battle between Swinson and a sabretooth tiger, we\u2019d probably bet on Swinson. He\u2019s the kind of guy that respects nature for what it is, so he only uses all-natural workout supplements.\n\nNick KoneliNick Koneli \u2013 Koneli understands the importance of cardio, and he doesn\u2019t keep quiet about it. When he\u2019s not sprinting, he\u2019s running. When he\u2019s not running, he\u2019s jogging. When he\u2019s not jogging, he\u2019s walking at a brisk pace. It\u2019s incredibly hard to keep up with Mr. Koneli, but he swears by his routine, and once you can get on Koneli\u2019s level, well, that\u2019s how you know you\u2019ve made it to the top.",
