        "text":"Ruby is a Message Oriented Language\n\nRailsGirls Brisbane, 15 Aug 2015\n\nMany people think of Ruby as an Object Oriented Language. It is - and a lovely one at that. But Ruby makes so much more sense if you think of it as a Message Oriented Language. Most of programming in Ruby involves sending messages to objects, and defining how objects should respond to messages. Master this and you\u2019ve almost mastered Ruby.\n\nWe can send a message to an object by using the dot operator, the message name, and an optional payload (typically known as arguments in other languages).\n\n\nobject.send(:message, payload)\n\nSo how do we add 2 & 3 in Ruby? We send the object 2 the message + and the payload 3:\n\n2.send(:+, 3)\n# => 5\n\nHow do we reverse the string RailsGirls? By sending a String object the message reverse:\n\n# => \"slriGslisR\"\n\nAnd to randomly generate 5 numbers between 0 and 100, we send a Range object the message to_a which responds with an Array Object. We then send this object the message sample and the payload 5:\n\n(0..100).send(:to_a).send(:sample, 5)\n# => [75, 89, 76, 62, 55]\n\nSyntactic Sugar\n\nEvery language is optimised for some quality. C is optimised for speed. Java is optimised for bureaucracy. Ruby is optimised for developer happiness.\n\nOne way to make developers happy is by giving them a rich and expressive language. Ruby does this by sprinkling some semantic sugar on top of its message oriented architecture. The first dollop of sugar let\u2019s us stop the tedious .send(:message) syntax and replace it with simply .message.\n\n2.send(:+, 3)\n# => 5\n\n# => 5  \n\n\"Hello, Ruby!\".send(:include?, \"Z\")\n# => false\n\n\"Hello, Ruby!\".include?(\"Z\")\n# => false\n\nNext, we can get rid of parenthesis so long as there is no ambiguity.\n\n2.+ 3\n# => 5  \n\n# => true\n\nFinally, some core objects have additional semantic sugar baked in.\n\n2.send(:+, 3)\n2 + 3\n# => 5\n\n\"I love Ruby\".send(:[], (2..5))\n\"I love Ruby\"[2..5]\n# => \"love\"\n\nMmmm, syntax. Yummy.\n\nEverything in Ruby is an Object. Almost\n\nSpend any time around Rubyists and you\u2019ll here that everything in Ruby is an object. That\u2019s almost true but why it\u2019s almost true becomes clearer when you understand just how Ruby conceives of objects.\n\nThe traditional coneption of an object in computer science is anything that holds state and exhibits behaviour. In Ruby however, an object is anything that responds to a message.\n\nNumbers are objects because they respond to messages.\n\n# => Fixnum\n\nStrings are objects because they respond to messages.\n\n\"Ruby is beautiful\".class\n# => String\n\nBooleans are objects because they respond to messages.\n\n# => TrueClass\n\nNils are objects because they respond to messages.\n\n# => NilClass\n\nObjects are obviously objects because they respond to messages.\n\n# => Class\n\nEven Classes are objects because they respond to messages.\n\n# => Class\n\nYes, the Class class is an object of class Class. Ruby is meta.\n\nResponding to Messages\n\nWhile much of programming in Ruby involves sending messages to objects, a lot also involves the other side of this relationship - defining how objects should respond to messages. The Ruby Core and Standard libraries already provide a bunch of useful functionality. Often however, we need to compose our own. Ruby of course, make this all very simple with the class keyword.\n\nclass MyFirstClass\n\nThat it - we\u2019ve just created a class of object called MyFirstClass. Out of the box, we get a lot of functionality thanks to Ruby\u2019s automatic inheritance from the Object class.\n\n# => [MyFirstClass, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]\n\n# => [:allocate, :new, :superclass, :freeze, :===, :==, :<=>, :<, :<=, :>, :>=, :to_s, :inspect, :included_modules, :include?, :name, :ancestors, :instance_methods, :public_instance_methods, :protected_instance_methods, :private_instance_methods, :constants, :const_get, :const_set, :const_defined?, :const_missing, :class_variables, :remove_class_variable, :class_variable_get, :class_variable_set, :class_variable_defined?, :public_constant, :private_constant, :singleton_class?, :include, :prepend, :module_exec, :class_exec, :module_eval, :class_eval, :method_defined?, :public_method_defined?, :private_method_defined?, :protected_method_defined?, :public_class_method, :private_class_method, :autoload, :autoload?, :instance_method, :public_instance_method, :nil?, :=~, :!~, :eql?, :hash, :class, :singleton_class, :clone, :dup, :taint, :tainted?, :untaint, :untrust, :untrusted?, :trust, :frozen?, :methods, :singleton_methods, :protected_methods, :private_methods, :public_methods, :instance_variables, :instance_variable_get, :instance_variable_set, :instance_variable_defined?, :remove_instance_variable, :instance_of?, :kind_of?, :is_a?, :tap, :send, :public_send, :respond_to?, :extend, :display, :method, :public_method, :singleton_method, :define_singleton_method, :object_id, :to_enum, :enum_for, :equal?, :!, :!=, :instance_eval, :instance_exec, :__send__, :__id__]\n\nTypically though, that isn\u2019t enough. Often, we need to define our own responses to messages which we do with the def keyword.\n\nclass Hipster\n  def ironic?\n\n  def opinion_on(it)\n     \"#{it} is so last year.\"\"\n\nNow we can create instance objects of our Hipster class, send them messages, and watch them respond.\n\nbyron =\n# => #<Hipster:0x007f83539f6130>\n\n# => true\n\nbyron.opinion_on \"Craft beer\"\n# => \"Craft beer is so last year.\"\n\nThat\u2019s largely all there is to Ruby. Just remember that it\u2019s a Message Oriented Language.",

        "text":"2k Members' Deal - 50% OFF on all plans\n\nDeveloper interview: Andr\u00e9 Wunsch\n\nAndr\u00e9 Wunsch is a really talented web designer from Berlin, Germany that works both\u00a0 as a freelance and with agencies, to serve clients in Germany, Austria, Switzerland.\n\n\nHe is a web designer, but also a web developer and SEO: so he knows how to build websites that are not only pleasing to the eye \u2013 but have clean code and good usability.\n\nAndr\u00e9\u2019s sites have not gone unnoticed, and even won some pretty important web design award like the 2017 Red Dot Award.\n\nAndr\u00e9\u00a0 is one of the most proficient users of LiveCanvas from it\u2019s early beta days; some of the sites in our showcase have it\u2019s signature, eg https:\/\/reinhaut.de \u2013 so it felt pretty natural to go and ask him some questions about his profession and his use of our tool.\n\nSo we\u2019re happy to introduce to our readers mr. Andr\u00e9 Wunsch! Let\u2019s get to know him a little better.\n\nHi Andr\u00e9, welcome to the LiveCanvas blog! First question\u2026.how did you get into Web design? Did you have a \u201cclick\u201d moment where you understood this was your way \u2013 or was it a more \u201cprogressive\u201d approach?\n\nHello LiveCanvas Team,\nthank you very much for the opportunity to introduce me on your blog.\n\nTo the first question, I have already dealt with the topic of building websites at a young age. It took a few years until I was working as a webdesigner full-time. I worked in different jobs, but I only felt totally comfortable in the digital and creative field.\n\nWhich is the aspect you like the most of your profession? Which is the most enjoyable part for you?\n\nI think every time it is a new challenge to build great websites. It never gets boring and you can fully live out your creativity, of course it always depends on the customer.\n\nWhich were the experiences \/ courses \/ learning moments that mostly have influenced you and helped your professional growth?\n\nThe daily challenges contribute to my growth. I offer every customer an individual and beautiful solution. We don\u2019t want to create a \u201cpreset\u201d website, because every customer has other ideas and expectations.\n\nWhich other page builder tools did you try using before LiveCanvas? Which of its peculiar features did you enjoy mostly \u00a0of LiveCanvas, convincing you to build some real sites with it, and giving it a go?\n\nBefore I worked with LiveCanvas, I tried various PageBuilders. There were also some good ones, but I thought they were always a bit inflexible and most PageBuilders were overloaded.\n\nI personally like working with Bootstrap, so LiveCanvas was perfect for me!\n\nI don\u2019t know how many times I searched for possible tools for Bootstrap and WordPress *laughing out loud*. Thank you for creating LiveCanvas!\n\nIn LiveCanvas I think it\u2019s great that you can work so freely and flexibly. At the previous projects there were no limits for me, what I imagined could be realized with LiveCanvas without any problems.\n\nAnother great point is that LiveCanvas is so slim and not overloaded. I love this tool!\n\nMany people who work in the digital fields enjoy being free to work from different places and tend to travel a lot. Does this apply to you? Or are you more productive in your own \u201cbat-cave\u201c?\n\nThis is still a dream of mine, which I would like to fulfill someday.\n\nCurrently I only work in Berlin where I am very productive.\nWhen I travel it\u2019s pure recreation for me and I waste no more time with thoughts of work.\n\nWhat do you like to do when you\u2019re not working on a website?\n\nWhen I\u2019m not building websites, I grab my camera and look at the world from different perspectives.\n\nWhen I need a real break, I grab my girlfriend, the backpacks and we start a backpacking tour.\n\nWell, thank you so much for you time Andr\u00e9,\n\nand thanks for your kind words regarding our product \u2013 we put a lot of love into it and it\u2019s very rewarding for us to see talented, performance-conscious webmasters who love to use it!\n\nTo know more about Andr\u00e9, or to get in touch with him, you can visit his portfolio site at https:\/\/andrewunsch.de\/",

        "text":"Delphix Partner Spotlight on tdglobal\n\nGlobal technology consulting firm tdglobal specializes in enterprise software and managed service solutions tailored to digital and data transformation initiatives. We spoke with Chief Operating Officer Wayne Borcher and Director of Data Management Tommy Erlank on how they enable customers to use data as a strategic asset and build their digital ecosystems.\n\nTell us about your primary area of expertise and the types of customers you work with.\u00a0\n\ntdglobal serves customers in almost every industry. Our portfolio of clients include finance, telco, insurance, government, and healthcare customers across Southeast Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa going back as far as 1991.\n\nOur solutions ultimately aim to establish trust in our customers\u2019 data, so they can build on or accelerate their digital transformation journeys. Invariably, digital transformation is not only introducing new technical and\/or financial challenges for our clients, but also highlighting old ones that are becoming stumbling blocks in their digital journeys.\n\nIn what ways do you help customers transform their data practices?\n\nWe spoke about the concept of helping customers trust their data, a challenge that is exponentially growing as the demand for access to data is ever increasing. Not only do customers have a renewed interest in implementing data quality initiatives for the cloud or hybrid cloud environments, but data governance is leading the charge to ensure the business gets the most from their transformation programs.\n\nOf course with these initiatives being top of mind with many of the executives we work with, data security and rapid data delivery play a vital role in making sure the right people get access to the right data at the right time to make critical business decisions, or to drive the success of their transformation projects.\n\nWe also work with all the major public cloud providers to help our customers with their cloud journeys as part of their digital transformation. Our analytics teams focus on real-time streaming analytics with geospatial solutions for telcos and healthcare, an area of our business that is also very dependent on fast access to clean data.\n\nFinally, we partner closely with our customers\u2019 marketing and CRM teams to make better business decisions using intelligent, AI-driven Customer 360 solutions.\n\nThe company also delivers an end-to-end Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) solution. How does it work with SAP Sybase?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInsight for SAP Sybase is one of tdglobal\u2019s subscription-based managed service solutions that combines software and services. It o\ufb00ers subscription licensing for many SAP Sybase products, including Adaptive Service Platform (ASE, IQ, and Replication Server), SQL Anywhere, as well as multiple other systems. In addition, the solution provides licensing, monitoring, and database services.\n\nWe are heavily invested in SAP, and we sell and support software across a wide range of use cases.\n\nInsight is certified and registered on the SAP Application Center for general access to customers. To extend our value offerings to SAP customers, we are working closely with the Delphix team to help our customers build agile SAP infrastructures by providing fast, secure access to data for business-critical projects.\n\nWe help enable SAP-driven organizations to release applications faster, improve quality, and migrate to SAP HANA with less risk. Our combined solution makes high-quality SAP data continuously available across use cases that span development, testing, data delivery, and analytics.\u00a0\n\nHow does Delphix help you better compete in the markets you serve?\u00a0\n\nWe leverage Delphix for our DevOps play as well as for securing lower-level environments.\u00a0 Delphix will help any DevOps project go faster and reduce costs. We add Delphix for provisioning to non-production for dev and test, as well as helping with projects that upgrade to HANA or to the cloud. Delphix adds additional value by providing complete management of heterogeneous sources across the entire enterprise database landscape.\n\nFor instance, one of our banking customers has 50 instances of Sybase, but they are struggling to upgrade the database platforms that support their business applications, such as Capital Markets platforms. They see Sybase as entrenched and don\u2019t have the necessary internal expertise, so our INSIGHT solution helps them there. For complex application upgrades of packaged applications like this, Delphix helps us modernize their DevOps practices by shortening software delivery cycles and securing test environments.\u00a0\n\nHere is another example, with a telco customer. Supporting development and testing for a billing system is not trivial, and the database is a behemoth. Delphix masking secures these critical systems for application teams, and virtualization lowers the cost of non-production environments. Upgrades are a massive project, and many of our customers put two live systems in place as a blue\/green configuration. This doubles up on platform licenses which adds tremendous costs, so eliminating data bottlenecks to help dev\/test move faster really impacts the financials.\n\nOur customers also run their batch jobs for financial close procedures off virtual instances on Delphix. Given the size of the databases, it is not uncommon for a batch job to fail somewhere in the cycle, creating a major bottleneck as tests have to be rerun. Our customers have learned to alleviate this problem by creating four or five virtual clones of the production database, then running the same batch job against all five clones\u2014increasing the odds that at least one of these jobs will succeed.\n\nWhat has changed the way you and your customers work in the analytics space?\n\nThere are two use cases that are a good fit.\n\nOne is operational. Our clients use Delphix to offload from production to an operational data store, where data is virtualized and pushed into smaller, more specialized data marts. These data marts are spun up for data security and governance initiatives, and this is where sensitive data is anonymized with Delphix masking. Once the data is secured, it is ready to push into a data warehouse for use in the analytics pipeline. The customer cleans the data prior to loading into the data warehouse, which saves time and money, and in turn means more people have access to secure data in order to complete their analytics work and make data-driven decisions faster.\n\nThe other use case is with the data warehouse itself. A data warehouse can easily be around 150TB or more. This is so large that to make a clean, secure copy takes three weeks of processing power to provide a quality dataset to development teams. With Delphix, those three weeks turn into just a few hours. They can then provision five copies and give to different dev teams without hurting the efficiency of the live data warehouse.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTell us how the partnership with Delphix aligns with your vision of success.\u00a0\n\nWhilst augmenting our current solutions, we are excited to further our investments in Delphix by extending the platform with our own plugins. The Delphix SDKs allow us to build our own adapters to provide customers and prospects with additional data source options to fit their unique data estate. We don\u2019t want a technical bottleneck in any of our regions across Southeast Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and developing our own extensions ensures a comprehensive solution that meets the needs of a diverse market base. Building these plugins also means we will offer support, upgrades, and maintenance to continue a strong customer relationship.\n\nDelphix is key to making and fulfilling promises to our customer base. Removing the data bottleneck helps customers realize value from our services much faster. Our presales, solution architects, and technical consultants who are involved in implementation are all trained on Delphix. For our customers, we\u2019re able to do the training ourselves or we connect them to the Delphix-provided training packages.\u00a0\n\nThis makes Delphix really strategic to our mix that results in more business for us because the story we have to tell is better when Delphix is part of the overall solution.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\nDelphix Partner Spotlight on Alithya\n\nFor more than two decades, Alithya has provided expertise and innovative solutions in software development, modernization, and quality assurance.

For mobility I have a bootable 128GB USB 3 drive with Linux on it which I use to leech on whatever computer resource is available.\n\nWhat software do you use?\n\nI've been finally able to completely switch to Linux last year. For Haxe development I use vim with the vaxe plugin.\n\nWhere do you get your inspiration?\n\nWorking on Haxe at this moment is very exciting. Every day I think of a possible library \/ use and this inspires me to try, hack and keep helping the Haxe environment to grow.\n\nWhich creatives\/developers\/artists do you admire most?\n\nI'm very fortunate to work with people I admire, both at work as the haxe devs. The Haxe team for sure, I owe a lot of what I know from sneaking in and reading Nicolas' and Hugh's code. As for artists, I really like cinema and I admire a lot Werner Herzog, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Peter Greenaway and many others. I also like horror flicks and monster movies.\n\nWhat contributions are you proud of?\n\nFor sure having done Haxe\/Java and Haxe\/C#. I use them daily at work and I feel very accomplished when I see it being useful for people.\n\nDid your contributions bring you work opportunities?\n\nYes. Though lately I've been looking for more time and less work.\n\nDo you use them in your projects?\n\nYes. Specially Haxe\/Java, I've been using it to process large amounts of data and the results with regards to speed have been great!\n\nHow did you get started with Haxe?\n\nI found Haxe while looking for Flash optimizations so I could work with 3D. I quickly fell in love with it and ended up doing the port of Away3DLite to Haxe at that time. When Flash stopped being popular, I felt very relieved to use Haxe.\n\nWhat problem does Haxe solve for you?\n\nHaxe helps me feel secure that I will be able to solve a problem in the best way as possible. I really like the power that Haxe has to assimilate technologies. Also Haxe macros help me think of new and simplified ways to solve a problem.\n\nWhat tips or resources would you recommend to a new Haxe user?\n\nUse the source, Luke.\n\nWhat Haxe libraries are you impressed by?\n\nStax is a very sweet library. Deltaluca's Nape is also very awesome, both in speed as in features. I like Cocktail a lot and I think it has the potential to be the only UI library we'll ever need. I may be a little biased but I really like the work that proletariat has done with HUGS :)\n\nWhat problem would you like to see solved by a new or existing Haxe library?\n\nI'd really like to have a more extended Standard Library. Actually I'm slowly working on taurine, which I plan to be able to fill that gap. One of the most difficult problems with haxe standard library is to deal with asynchronous \/ synchronous API differences.\n\nWhat is the best use of Haxe you've come across?\n\nI think that NME\/OpenFL is probably one of the best uses and demonstration of the power of Haxe.\n\nWhat do you see for the future for Haxe\/OpenFL?\n\nI hope to see a simplified version of OpenFL written as much as possible in Haxe itself (instead of using the cffi). This should make it much easier to port it and even embed it on other projects.\n\nSell your wwx2014 session!\n\nUnity is currently hands off the best 3D engine for indie game developers. The effort to be able to use Haxe with Unity was what made me start working on Haxe\/C#. This is now a reality.\n\nWhat is the best part of wwx for you?\n\nEven though I love technology I don't really like chatting via the internet. Getting to know the people behind handles and share ideas is really what motivates me.",

        "text":"Interview with Marc Worrell: Zotonic Rethinks the CMS with Erlang\n\nI took a minute from getting ready for my talk at\u00a0Erlang Factory\u00a0(and working on the day job) to talk with\u00a0Marc Worrell, Lead Architect\u00a0of\u00a0Zotonic\u00a0\u2013 a new Content Management System written entirely in Erlang. This is a brief overview of the system focused on the \u2018why\u2019 \u2013 the technical details are well covered on their site, but I wanted to understand the motivations behind a company taking on a project like this. Marc also runs his own programming consultancy,\u00a0WhatWebWhat.\n\nI\u2019m excited to experiment with Zotonic, but I frankly don\u2019t have a downloaded copy of Postgres lying around. I\u2019m planning on getting that installed in order to try it out and will report back.\n\nHere is the interview, as usual, emphasis mine.\n\nEI: Hi Marc, can you tell me the impetus for Zotonic?\n\nMW: I used to be the CTO at Mediamatic. Mediamatic built and maintains the community management system Anymeta. Anymeta grew from a simple library to a full fledged community management system. For that we added more and more interactivity and connectivity. Which brought us in a head-on collision with PHP.\n\nPHP is far from stellar in handling many small requests, can\u2019t keep connections open and gets really slow when your codebase grows. Though we need open connections to user agents, XMPP connectivity and quick turnaround on Ajax requests. All are challenging for PHP. So we ended up adding more and more system services to make PHP perform and have the system support our requirements.\n\nGrowing a site with PHP starts with opcode caches, memcached, a modified memcached with dependency checking, extra servers and then more servers. Finally adding XMPP server and client processes written in Python. A whole lot of extra software.\n\nAnd then we were still rewriting PHP tables into code so that it performed better on application load.\n\nFrustration, especially considering my background with building embedded development platforms. Embedded systems and the programming language C show what you can do with the available CPU power.\n\nAfter I left Mediamatic I started ask myself how to do this better, how to support those multi-core cpus, how to use those gigabytes of memory and how to have all the connectivity a modern website (information hub) needs.\n\nI checked out Ruby on Rails, I checked Django and some other frameworks. They promise a lot. They fall short when you benchmark their efficiency on modern cpus and server systems.\n\nThat is when I rediscovered Erlang. The book from Joe really brought me to the realisation that Erlang could solve most, if not all, the problems I was encountering. And his approach to failure was nothing short of a revelation to me.\n\nThis lay the seed for Zotonic, as there was nothing else.\n\nEI: The Zotonic team seems to have a lot of experience, what brought you together, and what do you do now? Is Zotonic your full-time venture or are you doing something else?\n\nMW: We all know each other from Mediamatic. Tim and Arjan still work for Mediamatic, Peet is a former colleague and now works for Mirabeau. I am currently a freelancer. Zotonic is my tool to deliver great looking web sites that perform well. You could say that it is my full time occupation. Tim and Arjan are part time working on Zotonic.\n\nWe get more and more project requests, so we are happy that we did make the right decision to start Zotonic and make it Open Source as well.\n\nEI: Why Erlang? How does it make a CMS easier if most will be non-distributed\/one-box systems, and Erlang isn\u2019t known for Raw I\/O performance? How are you taking advantage of Erlang\u2019s sweet-spot of easy distributed message passing?\n\nMW: We are now using Erlang\u2019s excellent failure handling and multiprocessing capabilities. I think that the failure handling and with it the possibility to make robust systems is one of the often overlooked features of Erlang, when not the most important.\n\nWe don\u2019t use the distributed nature of Erlang, yet. But that might change quite soon.\n\nThat text processing is essential for web apps is a misconception. Most web apps only parse requests, fetch some data, concatenate a whole lot of text chunks and then output them over a socket back to the user agent. You don\u2019t need text processing for that. In fact on low end machines Erlang is quite capable of saturating a gigabit connection. Informal benchmarks gave more than 6000 page requests per second (famous helloworld templates) on a low end server. That should be enough.\n\nTo achieve this performance we made some rather big changes to Webmachine. Basho will be looking into incorporating those changes into the mainstream Webmachine code.\n\nAnd programming in a functional language is fun\u00a0:-)\n\nEI: NoSQL support? is it important for a CMS? Are there plans to support Riak or Couch or MongoDB?\n\nMW: NoSQL is really the story of the day. A lot of people see it as a means to an end. Some think you need it for performance. That is not true. An external party did some benchmarking on Zotonic and expected the database to be the main bottle neck. It was not, by far.\n\nAs I often say, the best way to achieve high performance is to not hit the database. Add some caching and the current RDBMS products can bring you a long way, especially on modern hardware. When you don\u2019t need millions of objects and 99.99% uptime guarantees then I suggest that you just use a RDBMS. Your data will be safe and the administrators of your customer will be happy that they can access the data easily.\n\nHaving said that, we are looking into Riak and some other distributed stores. We have some projects at hand that require a scale and uptime that will make us move to a distributed system with elegant failure handling. Only with these requirements a distributed store becomes important.\n\nEI: How do you guys use Zotonic yourselves? From an end-user perspective, how does it differ from WordPress or Drupal?\n\nMW: A first impression is important. And the first impression of Zotonic is its speed. I had people asking things like \u201cstop\u2026 did I really see five pages just now?\u201d They are used to the slowness of WordPress and Drupal, at least when not using Google, Yahoo or one of the other big sites.\n\nOver time there will be another big difference: realtime. We are in the process of adding more and more realtime features. They enable realtime communicationa and federation of data. It doesn\u2019t matter where your data (profile, blog etc.) is, it matters that it is up to date and can be published where you want it.\n\nFor ourselves, we are moving all our sites, blogs, and whatnot to Zotonic. It is more fun in Zotonic and we are eager to use the PubSub capabilities Arjan just added.\n\nEI: From the IT-guy perspective, why should he roll out Zotonic?\n\nMW: You need less hardware for more visitors. Let\u2019s give an example.\n\nWe made the site for the New Island Festival, a cultural festival in New York. At some point we were seeing sustained traffic of 2 mbit. What made that traffic impressive was that the site was hosted on a small VPS and only using 5-10% cpu. We have seen other requirements for PHP sites\u00a0:)\n\nEI: What are the largest deployments so far?\n\nMW: The New Island Festival was a nice test bed for the number of visitors. A bit bigger, content-wise, site we just finished is the site for the Mediafonds in the Netherlands. This site has around 25000 pages.\n\nWe are now working on a project with a projected page count of around a million and later we will have a project that requires a ten fold higher page count.\n\nEI: Roadmap \u2013 what are your plans for the future of Zotonic?\n\nMW: We have now scheduled or are planning:\n- redesign of the admin environment.\n- redesign of the access permission system to better support user generated content.\n- extended support of XMPP PubSub, also sharing images and other metadata.\n- realtime tools for server monitoring.\n- support for distributed Zotonic nodes (still with a central store).\n- support for a distributed, fault tolerant data and file store.\n\nAnd many smaller changes that will make the system better for building the websites our customers and programmers love.\n\nEI: MySQL Support? Is it planned?\n\nMW: No, we don\u2019t plan MySQL support. Though it should be do-able with the new binary driver. Right now we are focusing on the distributed version with a k\/v store.\n\nThanks, Marc!\n\nEdit: Only July 21, I took out \u2018destroys WordPress\u2019 from the title; upon reflection, I realized my Erlang zeal got the better of me..\n\nLeave a comment",
