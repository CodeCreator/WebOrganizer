IIASA Interim Report. IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria: IR-07-028\n\n\nDownload (831kB) | Preview\n\n\nLand use and land cover change practices contribute to climate change mitigation initiatives by increasing biotic carbon storage, and by producing biomass for bioenergy, as a substitute for fossil fuels. In this paper we examine opportunities in Slovakia for two land use activities, reforestation and short-rotation forest plantation, using four scenarios. In order to evaluate alternative GHG emission reduction policies, of carbon sequestration supply curves were constructed for both activities, for all regions in the country. Our regionally detailed results apply novel modeling approaches involving spatially explicit analyses of land biophysical and economic productivity that are easily applicable to other transition countries.\n\nThe overall theoretical maximum sequestration potential on agricultural land by reforestation in Slovakia accounts for approximately 10% of national CO2 emissions. More realistic scenarios, focusing on lower quality marginal land have a potential for carbon sequestration of approximately 1.7%-2.4% of total CO2 emissions. In our estimations, potential maximum use of biomass for bio-energy, using all available agricultural land, would be 64% of renewable energy consumption, with reference to average usage during 1997-2002. Realistic potentials of bio-energy generation on lower quality land may cover about 6% of total demand. We conclude by discussing needs to integrate biophysical and economic model estimates of carbon sequestration potential with local and regional information collected through a stakeholder engagement process. Overall, we argue that there is a necessity to embed carbon sequestration activities within regional development plans, and to back up land use and forest policies with adequate economic incentives and public engagement in environmental decisionmaking.\n\nItem Type: Monograph (IIASA Interim Report)\nResearch Programs: Modeling Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes (LUC)\nDepositing User: IIASA Import\nDate Deposited: 15 Jan 2016 08:40\nLast Modified: 29 Oct 2016 19:56\nURI: http:\/\/pure.iiasa.ac.at\/8429\n\nActions (login required)\n\nView Item View Item\n\nInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)\nSchlossplatz 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria\nPhone: (+43 2236) 807 0 Fax:(+43 2236) 71 313",

        "text":"Emergence Of Gravity\n\nIn Dark Matter by Brian Koberlein9 Comments\n\nAs dark matter continues to vex astronomers, new solutions to the\u00a0dark matter question are proposed. Most focus on pinning down the form of dark matter, while others propose modifying gravity to account for the effect. But a third proposal is simply to remove gravity from the equation. What if the effects of gravity aren\u2019t due to some fundamental force, but are rather an emergent effect due to other fundamental interactions?\u00a0A new paper proposes just that, and if correct it could also explain the effects of dark matter.\n\nThe idea of emergent gravity isn\u2019t entirely new. The most popular variation was proposed in 2010, where Erik Verlinde argued that gravity is not a fundamental force, but rather an effect that arises from the entropy of the Universe. Entropy is a property of thermodynamics. It\u2019s often described as the\u00a0unusable part of a system (or the waste heat if you will) and while that\u2019s sometimes a useful description, a better description involves the amount of information contained within a system.\u00a0An ordered system (say, marbles evenly spaced in a grid) is easy to describe because the objects have simple relations to each other. On the other hand, a disordered system (marbles randomly scattered) take more information to describe, because there isn\u2019t a simple pattern to them. Basically, the more information it takes to describe a system, the more entropy it has.\n\nVerlinde\u2019s model uses this connection between thermodynamics (heat, energy, and forces) and information through a mathematical method known as the holographic principle. Since the information contained within a region of space depends upon the arrangement of objects within that region, moving the objects can change the entropy within the region. Verlinde demonstrated that this produces an entropic force that acts like gravity. From the basic idea of information entropy, one can\u00a0derive Einstein\u2019s equations of general relativity exactly.\n\nEntropic gravity is an interesting idea, and it would explain why gravity is so difficult to bring into the fold of quantum physics, but it\u2019s not without its problems. For one, since entropic gravity predicts exactly the same gravitational behavior as general relativity, there\u2019s no experimental way to distinguish it as a better theory. There are also theoretical problems with the model. For example, if you try to describe a gravitationally closed system of masses within the model it only matches experiment if you place weird constraints on the entropy of the system.\n\nBut despite its problems the idea is at least worth exploring, and this latest work adds a new twist by describing the effects of dark matter. In the original formulation, the model\u00a0focused on standard gravity. Specifically, it excluded dark energy. This new paper notes that since the dark energy of a region of space requires additional information to describe, including it in the model changes the entropy of a region of space. The paper then goes on to show how this additional information creates an additional entropic force. One that might account for the effects of dark matter similar to other modified gravity models such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MoND). Thus gravity, dark matter, and dark energy might all be connected through entropy.\n\nWhile this seems like an elegant solution to several cosmological problems, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. For one, this new variation of emergent gravity still has the same theoretical difficulties of the original. Then there\u2019s the fact that modified gravity models fail to explain large scale effects such as the clustering of galaxies, which regular gravity and dark matter explains very well. This new work is still more of an idea and less of a robust theory.\n\nBut even if the model doesn\u2019t work out in the end, it demonstrates how thermodynamics and gravity are deeply connected in ways that aren\u2019t obvious at first glance.\n\nPaper:\u00a0E.

Verlinde.\u00a0On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of NewtonarXiv:1001.0785\u00a0(2010)\n\n\n  1. I have a suspicion that Verlinde is onto something huge. As you say, a lot remains to be sorted out, but if you can explain both dark energy and matter and as a sideline the gravitational behaviour of galaxies and galaxy clusters by a parameter free (almost) theoretical argument based on string theory, I call it a good days work.\n\n  2. How can \u201demergent gravity from entropy\u201d can be related to the gravitational waves recently observed? Wasen\u2019t that observation a evidence for gravity to be a fondamental force, or they are not related\n\n    1. I am no expert\u2026.but I have a theory\u2026the Ligo Scientic corporation states that the cause of gravitational wave is rotation of spherically non-symmetric mass about a fixed axis . for example, a perfectly spherical star spinning about its axis would not produce a gravitational wave but a star with a lump on its surface would emit gravitational waves, now, relating this to entropic energy : a perfectly spherical star would not have a change in entropy when it spins, as the physical appearence of the star taken at any two time instants is exactly the same. thus, there is no entropic force acting & hence there is no gravitational wave. But when a star with a lump rotates, its physical appearence would be same only if the time interval is an integral multiple of its period of rotation. i.e, if at one instant the lump is on right side then after a few instants the lump would be on left side ( for time interval = time period\/2), so that means there is no spherical symmetry when it rotates or even if its stationary. when this star rotates, the entropy of the system is continuously changing because in each instant the position of the lump changes. thus, the entropic energy associated with the star will continually change. if gravity is an emergent force due to change in entropy, then that means, an object that is not spherically symmetrical when rotates will continually radiate gravitational waves due to the continuous change in entropy associated with it. Damn ! that indeed would explain GW. Lol !\n\n  3. Another aspect of Verlinde\u2019s latest paper is that, in addition to entropic and holographic considerations, he treats Spacetime (actually static \u2018space\u2019) like an elastic solid, and addresses the stress-strain relationship using the usual linear approximation. Using similar thermodynamic and holographic considerations, and treating Spacetime as a dynamic elastic solid, one can calculate that the total energy density is the Critical Friedmann value that makes space \u2018flat\u2019, as observed. One can also predict that the energy density of Dark Energy is 2\/3 of the total \u2013 again, in good agreement with observations.\n\n  4. Describing gravity, dark matter, and dark energy in terms of entropy seems to me like relating four dependent variables without knowing what is independent. This would explain the bizarre constraints required for it to work in a closed system. Elegant as it is, I haven\u2019t bought into this approach yet.\n\n  5. Gravity was INVENTED to bolster the lie of the Copernicus globe earth. Even they did not believe gravity was viable.\n\nLeave a Reply",
