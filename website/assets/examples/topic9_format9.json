        "text":"Crowdfunding platforms: what are my options?\n\nCrowdfunding platforms can be pretty confusing, right? There\u2019s lots of them, and they all offer different things. Because of this, it can be difficult to know which crowdfunding platform is right for your startup. But the right information can make a world of difference. In this article, we\u2019ll talk you through 5 different crowdfunding platforms and what you can expect from them: Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Crowdcube, Crowdfunder and Crowd Supply. We\u2019ll cover their pros and cons and how well each crowdfunding platform caters to startups.\n\n\nLogo for crowdfunding platform Kickstarter\n\nKickstarter\u2019s the biggest name in crowdfunding, and the crowdfunding platform behind massive successes like Pebble. The fact it\u2019s so well-known is definitely in its favour \u2013 journalists are more likely to peruse Kickstarter for stories (which means free PR for you) and on top of that, it just gets more traffic. Since its inception back in 2009, there have been\u00a0124,813 successful projects on Kickstarter.\n\nDespite this, it\u2019s not always the best option for a startup. For one, Kickstarter funds specific, creative projects.\u00a0That means there\u2019s got to be an end product or experience in mind:\n\nEverything on Kickstarter must be a project. A project has a clear goal, like making an album, a book, a gadget, or a work of art. A project will eventually be completed, and something will be produced by it.\n\nThis means it\u2019s not often\u00a0suitable for web startups. However, if your startup is working towards a specific project \u2013 for example, if you\u2019re a tech startup who design\u00a03D printers \u2013 you can use Kickstarter.\n\nThere are other things to bear in mind too. Kickstarter use an\u00a0all or nothing\u00a0system of crowdfunding. This means that if you don\u2019t raise your full target, you won\u2019t get anything. That said, this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. If the funds were still released when the target wasn\u2019t met, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019d have enough money to fulfil your promises to your backers anyway. Plus, if you don\u2019t raise enough money, you won\u2019t be charged anything by the platform.\n\nBut what about if you do raise enough? What sort of fees are you looking at for using the platform? Kickstarter take 5% commission from the total raised, as well as payment processing fees. These processing fees vary depending on where you live, but generally are about 3-5%.\n\nSpeaking of location, you will have to check you\u2019re eligible to post a project on Kickstarter. You\u2019re eligible\u00a0to put up a project on Kickstarter if you live in any of these countries:\u00a0US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, France, Spain,\u00a0Italy, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Mexico.\n\n> Read our guide on setting up a Kickstarter campaign.\n\n\n\nLogo for crowdfunding platform Indiegogo\n\nIndiegogo markets itself as a more democratised crowdfunding platform, and this means it\u2019s a bit more flexible than Kickstarter. You can fundraise for pretty much anything, whether it\u2019s an entrepreneurial project or a personal cause. You can also set a longer deadline than Kickstarter allows. Plus, it\u2019s available in all countries where PayPal can be used.\n\nIndiegogo also\u00a0offers different funding options. You can choose fixed funding or flexible funding. Fixed is like Kickstarter\u2019s system \u2013 you only get the money if you raise the full amount. Flexible funding lets you have any money you raise \u2013 but as we said earlier, this isn\u2019t always a good idea if you\u2019ve calculated a specific amount for specific reasons. Flexible funding is better suited for charitable and personal fundraising, where any amount will help.\n\nProjects are also automatically sorted on Indiegogo, while on Kickstarter there\u2019s an element of manual curation from the staff. This, again, is part of their effort to make the crowdfunding system more democratic. They call the algorithm that does this the Gogofactor:\n\nThe gogofactor is an algorithm that helps campaigns achieve greater visibility on\u2014and reach audiences who may find them interesting.\n\nThe gogofactor is influenced by several aspects, including the scope of a campaign\u2019s social engagement (such as Facebook likes and shares), and global reach.\n\nDepending on payment method, Indiegogo\u2019s fees vary between a total of 8-10% (including processing.) These are similar to Kickstarter\u2019s and are pretty standard across the board.\n\nCompared to Kickstarter, Indiegogo has a much smaller audience and much less press coverage. Although Indiegogo\u2019s been around longer, there have been fewer successful projects and they only have about one sixth of the userbase of Kickstarter. This means journalists are less likely to notice an Indiegogo campaign, meaning it can be harder to create a buzz that way. That doesn\u2019t mean you should disregard them though. Their flexibility is a big boon in their favour, especially given that you have more options in what you can fundraise for. This is good for startups, as it means you can use the money to cover some more general set-up costs. You can also set up a campaign without having to wait for Indiegogo to review it.\n\n\nLogo for crowdfunding platform Crowdcube\n\nCrowdcube is a UK based equity crowdfunding platform. This means it works differently to Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which work on a rewards system. A rewards system is where backers receive a something specific\u00a0in exchange for backing the product. Equity crowdfunding means the backer is directly investing in the company in exchange for shares:\n\nCrowdcube is the world\u2019s first and leading investment crowdfunding platform, where a community of like\u00adminded people pool their money and knowledge together to back startup, early and growth stage businesses. Crowdcube gives everyone the opportunity to become \u2018armchair Dragons\u2019, building upon their own investment portfolio and supporting British businesses.\n\nThis is closer to traditional funding methods, such as angel investing and venture capitalism. However, you\u2019re opening it up to the general public \u2013 backers on Crowdcube can invest as little as \u00a310. This does mean you\u2019re losing one of the main benefits of crowdfunding \u2013 the fact that you don\u2019t have to surrender equity. On the other hand, it also means you\u2019ve got more flexibility in how you use the investment and don\u2019t have to worry about rewards. Creating and distributing rewards can be both costly and time-consuming. Plus, if you don\u2019t want hundreds of investors on your share register, they offer a \u2018nominee\u2019 system:\n\nWith a nominee, Crowdcube holds and is the legal owner of the investment on behalf of your investors so you have only one legal shareholder on your share register.\n\nAlternatively, their direct system means everyone who backs you will be a legal shareholder. This has the advantage of building a closer relationship with your backers.\n\nThey\u2019re very well established, owning about 50% of the UK market. Unlike rewards-based systems, their specific focus is on funding startups, which means they\u2019re very fit for purpose. For instance, they\u2019ve got stringent due diligence processes\u00a0built into their platform. As part of this, they offer a lot of guidance\u00a0on using their platform. And they have FSA approval, so are a safe bet.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, like Kickstarter, they offer an\u00a0all or nothing\u00a0model. Money is only taking from investors when the goal is reached. Their success rate is pretty stellar though, with 60% of campaigns successful. In terms of fees, they charge 7% commission on the funds raised, plus Stripe payment processing fees.\n\n> If you\u2019re in the USA, offers a similar service.\u00a0It\u2019s worth noting the USA has stricter rules about accredited investors, so it\u2019s not quite the same as crowdfunding from the general public.\n\nLogo for crowdfunding platform Crowdfunder\n\nThis is another UK-based crowdfunding platform. In many ways, it\u2019s not too different to Kickstarter or Indiegogo. You set up a project asking for backers, in return for rewards. With Crowdfunder, you also have the option to just ask for donations without a reward. They say their funding model is great for startups:\n\n\u201cYou could be a community group, a start-up, a great cause, a charity or an organisation in need of some funding.\u201d\n\nA big perk on Crowdfunder is the fact they have additional funding available. As well as the money you raise from \u2018The Crowd\u2019, you could also be eligible for extra pledges of up to \u00a310,000 from \u2018The Funders\u2019. These Funders tend to be government bodies and banks who are offering grants to support startups. It\u2019s definitely not something be sniffed at!\n\nLike Indiegogo, you have a choice between \u2018all or nothing\u2018 or \u2018keep what you raise\u2018. The same warning applies \u2013 make sure that if you choose to keep what you raise, you\u2019ll still be able to give your backers what you\u2019ve promised them. They have the same fees for both systems \u2013 5% + VAT + payment processing fees.\n\nCrowd Supply\n\nLogo for crowdfunding platform Crowdsupply\n\nCrowd Supply is an another\u00a0crowdfunding platform, but they\u2019re pretty strict about who they allow to use them. They support\u00a0original, useful\u00a0and\u00a0respectful\u00a0hardware. So basically, they cater more for the new gadget side of crowdfunding. But if you fit into this criteria, they\u2019re a fantastic option with some seriously impressive success rates. So far, 58% of projects have been successful. Even more\u00a0impressively, 100% of fully funded projects have been delivered to backers. This is because they take a hands-on approach and help with the fulfilment process, including shipping products out of their own warehouse. This commitment to helping with shipping can really simplify the later stages of a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nThey offer a number of plans, with varying levels of guidance. Their fees vary depending on which you choose:\n\nSo now you\u2019ve picked your platform, it\u2019s time to get your campaign going. Read our ultimate checklist on everything you\u2019ll need to crowdfund your startup.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBecca is the Marketing Executive at... (truncated)",

Always do your homework and you won\u2019t get schooled.\n\nHere\u2019s some great tools that we\u2019ve found and we use from time to time and great real estate investing resources for investors to tap into for quick research on your investment deals.\n\nThe best thing is most of these sites below are completely free!\n\nHere\u2019s a few sites you should get to know:\n\n1. Zillow\n\nZillow is the biggest, baddest real estate website on the block. They are building data on real estate wealth like few other sites.\n\nThe CEO of Zillow, Spencer Rascoff, said their company\u2019s best asset was their \u201cliving database of all homes\u201d.\n\nThe Zestimate tool is off, as a lot of folks have noted. It\u2019s fun to see what the\u00a0computer calculates, but you still gotta know how to analyze the comps and evaluate\u00a0the market for yourself.\n\nSpend a lot of time on Zillow and get to know the intimate details of each property\u00a0sold in your target neighborhoods. Really try to identify the psychology of the\u00a0prices, and seek to understand why the seller and buyer picked that point to settle.\n\nRemember, each sale is like a tiny piece of a moving puzzle that makes up the whole\u00a0market.\n\nZillow is an awesome tool for investors to get to know their markets.\n\n2. Craiglist\n\nCraigslist is an awesome site. There\u2019s huge deals there, if you spend the time on the\u00a0site. People write terrible ads for great properties. Happens every hour of every day\u00a0across\u00a0the USA. Sometimes the best properties only get one terrible ad. So you\u2019ve got\u00a0to scour.\n\n3. LoopNet\n\nLoopNet is the granddaddy of commercial real estate investing.\n\nYou wanna sell a gigantic building to institutional investors, this is the site\u00a0you want to list it on.\n\nSometimes there are great deals on LoopNet, but you\u2019re competing with every other\u00a0investor to find them. If you are a Grade-A investor working with a top broker,\u00a0you\u2019ve got a chance to win the bid and seal the deal. This is not the site for rookies.\n\nLoopNet is a great place to learn about the market and see how the major\u00a0money is moving. You\u2019ll be surprised what you can learn, so start searching through\u00a0the properties for sale and watching where they close.\n\n\nJust like its name suggests, is a big clearinghouse of auctions, \u2014\u00a0foreclosures, REOs, short sales, distressed properties, land, new construction \u2014 you\u00a0name it, they probably sell it.\n\nDefinitely check out the auction calendar, and make a trip to visit some auctions. You never know who you might meet at an auction \u2013 maybe your future\u00a0business partner?\n\n\nThe largest place to search the MLS (multiple listing service), is\u00a0sometimes confusing and often doesn\u2019t seem consistent with what data it displays.\n\nBut it\u2019s got some neat search alerts and other tools that help you get alerted when a\u00a0broker in your neighborhood has added a listing. If you\u2019re serious about investing,\u00a0you probably want to form a good relationship with an excellent Realtor, rather than\u00a0just the website.\n\n6. Walkscore\n\nMost investors overlook \u2013 a big mistake.\n\nWalkscore tells you a ton about any given address. It tells you how a potential renter\u00a0or buyer will evaluate it \u2013 what\u2019s nearby and how long it takes to access.\n\nIt\u2019s also a fantastic tool to target areas that are underpriced for their amenities. If\u00a0an area has a really high walkscore and low prices, chances are good that prices will\u00a0rise in the next few years. There\u2019s big exceptions \u2013 but walkability is a really key\u00a0factor for investments.\n\nThose tools will help you to understand the area market, if you take the\u00a0time to use them. Do your homework, and understand the market before you start\u00a0dumping your hard-earned money into a property.\n\nYou can always give us a call Toll Free 1-833-4Turnkey \u2013 we love to partner up with investors, and we\u2019ve got\u00a0great terms.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to access local investment properties, great!\n\nJoin our Preferred Nationwide Investment\nProperty Buyers List FREE Here >>\n\n\nAbout Luke\n\nLuke has 38 years experience in real estate transactions with a background in Construction, Property Management, Real Estate Brokerage, Mortgage Banking and Corporate Finance.\n\nGet More Real Estate Market Info...

        "text":"Why Gold Continues to Shine\n\nGold has been rallying higher since the start of 2014. In late December 2013, the precious metal was trading as low as $1181.40 an ounce, today the spot price of gold is $1342.50 an ounce. The current pattern on the daily chart of gold futures looks poised to trade into the $1400.00 level.\n\nHere are three reasons why gold should continue to rally in the near term:\n\n1. Gold is once again being viewed as a currency and not as a useless relic. At this time, investors are questioning all of this money printing by the central banks around the world. How long can these central bankers continue to just print money in order to inflate asset prices and boost exports? Think about it, record money printing is taking place by the Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and other central banks around the world. The money printing by the central banks has even helped the virtual currency Bitcoin to gain traction over the past year. Remember, the reason why gold was used as a currency throughout history is because governments could not print it at will, unlike a fiat currency such as the U.S. Dollar or Japanese Yen.\n\n2. The consumer sentiment for gold in 2011 was enormous as almost everyone was bullish, but that is not the case today. Currently, many analysts and financial firms are still extremely bearish on gold since it plunged from its 2011 top. As long as the sentiment remains negative for gold it should continue to hold up and trade nicely higher. When everyone gets bullish on gold again, that is probably the time to jump ship and become less bullish on the precious metal.\n\n3. The current chart pattern on spot gold is bullish. Gold futures (GC J4) are trading sideways around the $1350.00 level. Whenever an equity consolidates and builds a sideways base it is getting poised to trade higher on the chart.\n\nAbout Nicholas Santiago 576 Articles\n\nAffiliation: InTheMoneyStocks.com\n\nNicholas Santiago started trading in 1991.

Google\u2019s decision to scrap ads from the right-hand side of the SERP was the topic of discussion among the digital marketing community, and for good reason.

        "text":"10 Questions to Ask a Debt Settlement Company\n\nThis article contains a list of 10 questions to ask a debt settlement company before you join a debt relief program.\n\nAs you might have noticed from our customer reviews, people either love or hate their debt settlement company. There are two reasons for this.\n\n  \u2022 They chose the wrong debt settlement company for their financial situation\n  \u2022 Or\/and they have unrealistic expectations about the benefits and disadvantages of a debt settlement.\n\nThis article provides a cheat sheet with 10 questions you should ask a potential debt settlement company to make sure it\u2019s a good fit for you. Read this guide for a comprehensive discussion of the pros and cons of a debt settlement.\n\nFree Debt Relief Consultation\n\nThe 10 Questions You Should Absolutely Ask Before Hiring a Debt Settlement Company\n\nIf you are deep in debt and you can only afford to make minimum payments, it makes sense to find out what your debt relief options are. Click here for a free debt settlement consultation. If you decide a debt settlement is a good option for your financial situation, make sure you ask the following questions before committing to a debt settlement company.\u00a0free debt settlement consultation\n\nAre you licensed to licensed to do business in my state?\n\nIf your agent doesn\u2019t know or is evasive about this question, beware. Some states have special restrictions and requirements on the use of debt management strategies. For instance, Alaska and Alabama have no restrictions, but California, Connecticut, Indiana, and Colorado all require firms to place a surety bond and register with the attorney office.\n\nHere is a list of current state regulations on debt management practices.\n\nHow long have you been in business?\n\nAlthough it is perfectly possible a company that started last month will provide excellent service, you may want to let others take the chance first. Look for companies that have been in the debt settlement business for five years or more. You can check this on our review pages. While you\u2019re at it, check their Supermoney and BBB rating.\n\nAre you a member of the American Fair Credit Council or AFCC?\n\nAFCC members agree to follow strict industry standards. Every year, the AFCC and a third-party verification firm audit AFCC members to ensure they are following the highest ethical and quality requirements. It is not a requirement for debt settlement companies to be AFCC members, but you have to ask yourself why a serious company would not want to be part of the largest trade association serving the industry.\n\nFree Debt Relief Consultation\n\nHow much do your services cost?\n\nAlthough prices range depending on the services a company offers and the size of your debt, you want to make sure you get a clear answer. Typically, fees range from 18% to 25% of the enrolled debt balances. If your agent uhms and arrs about how much their services cost or how fees are calculated, proceed with caution.\n\nChoose a debt settlement company that only charges fees when they have settled an account. If you even get the whiff that a company wants to charge you upfront fees before they settle your account, run.\n\nWhere will you deposit my money while I\u2019m waiting for a settlement?\n\nDebt settlement programs generally take 24 to 48 months to complete. During that time, debtors make payments in an escrow account. Once the account has enough money, the debt settlement company uses the cash to negotiate a lump-sum settlement with creditors.\n\nMake sure your debt settlement company deposits your money in a bank that is FDIC insured. The account should be in your name, and you should have absolute control over the money in it. If the company asks you to save the money on your own or to deposit it in their business account for safekeeping, you know what to do. Run.\n\nWill you be making monthly payments to my creditors on my behalf?\n\nThis is a trick question. Debt settlements don\u2019t make payments to creditors. The whole point of the debt settlement method is to save the money you were using to make minimum payments on your debts to save toward a lump-sum payment. If you continue making your payments, creditors have no incentive to accept a settlement. They will happily continue cashing your monthly payments for years or decades.\n\nCan Creditors Sue Me?\n\nThis is another trick question to weed out companies that offer unrealistic assurances to clients. In some cases, creditors have the legal right to sue borrowers who are late on their payments. A debt settlement company worth its salt will try to negotiate with creditors to avoid this from happening, but no reputable company can guarantee this won\u2019t happen.\n\nHow long will it take to settle my first account?\n\nAlthough debt settlement companies cannot guarantee how long it will take a creditor to agree to a settlement, they should provide a rough estimate based on their experience. What you are looking for here is to ensure your company has a clear plan of action.\n\nAs long as you are regular with your monthly payments to the escrow account, you should get your first settlement within four to six months.\n\nCan you stop my creditors or their debt collectors from calling me?\n\nThe answer you want to hear is no. If the agent assures you they will put a stop to creditor calls, hang up. It is impossible to guarantee this.\n\nWill debt settlement hurt my credit?\n\nAgain, this is a reality check to separate serious debt relief specialists from scammers.\n\nThe right answer is yes. All debt settlement programs have a negative impact on your credit. Any company that claims it can guarantee creditors will not report missed payments to the credit bureaus is trying to scam you.\n\nNow you know the questions that separate legitimate debt settlement companies from the scammers that give the business a bad name, you are ready to start checking companies. Supermoney has done part of the job by filtering the leading companies based on the factors mentioned above.
