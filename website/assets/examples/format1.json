Occasionally, hyperemesis gravidarum requires hospitalization to prevent dehydration, and sometimes parenteral nutrition is required. Crohn's disease may be associated with exacerbations in the second and third trimesters.

Successful pregnancy requires important physiologic adaptations, such as a marked increase in cardiac output. Medical problems that interfere with the physiologic adaptations of pregnancy increase the risk for poor pregnancy outcome; conversely, in some instances pregnancy may adversely impact an underlying medical disorder. ...\n\n    pdf22p socolanong 25-04-2012 29 3 \u00a0\u00a0Download\n\n  \u2022 Ectopic pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy in which the implantation of the embryo occurs out- side the uterine cavity, most frequently in one of the two fallopian tubes or, more rarely, in the abdo-minal cavity or the cervix .\n\n    pdf8p thaodien102 06-11-2015 17 2 \u00a0\u00a0Download\n\n  \u2022 More than seven hundred thousand teenagers a year get pregnant in the United States.

Two of the most important prerequisites are that the condition should be accurately defi ned and that there should be measurable outcomes of interest. Another requirement is that there must be some systematic way of data collection or surveillance that will allow the measurement of the outcomes of interest and associated risk factors. The epidemiologic evaluation of critical illness associated with pregnancy has met with mixed success on all of these counts....\n\n    pdf760p socolanong 23-04-2012 59 12 \u00a0\u00a0Download\n\n  \u2022 A study in Herat province concludes that the extraordinarily high number of deaths of women during pregnancy and childbirth are largely preventable. They are a direct consequence of the very young marriage age for women and girls (according to UNIFEM, 54% of girls under the age of 18 are married),12 poor health and nutrition, too-frequent childbearing, and virtually no access to gynecological and obstetrical services.\n\n    pdf34p le_minh_nha 18-12-2012 39 8 \u00a0\u00a0Download\n\n  \u2022 Current practice guidelines for ventilatory management advocate protective lung strategies to prevent volutrauma, barotrauma, atelectrauma and biotrauma (3-5).

The methods include oral contraceptives (the Pill) as well as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) such as intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants (e.g., Implanon), or injectables (e.g., Depo-Provera). LARCs are particularly important because they are the most effective in preventing unintended pregnancies and have lower failure rates.\n\n    pdf12p connicquy 20-12-2012 13 4 \u00a0\u00a0Download\n\n  \u2022 Ensuring universal access to SRH services and information is essential for achieving many, if not all, of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially those on maternal health, child survival, HIV and AIDS and gender equality [5]. Most maternal deaths can be prevented if there is skilled attendance at birth to cope with potentially fatal complications. Access to safe and effective family planning services and contraception empowers women to have more control over when to have children and lessens the incidence of unsafe abortions.\n\n    pdf5p ut_hai_can 25-12-2012 23 4 \u00a0\u00a0Download\n\n  \u2022 The need for A Bird in the Bush: Failed Domestic Policies of the George W. Bush Administration was sparked by what many informed and responsible Americans have seen as serious blunders committed by President George W. Bush during his first term of office. Especially troublesome is the 2005 Inaugural Address. This second inaugural address illustrates how \u201cBush II\u201d is derailing the purpose of America as a nation. (It is analyzed in the introduction.) Bush II could not perform this derailing all on his own.

Fortunately, most of the risk occurs to a minority of patients. Thus, it is prudent to identify those at risk and attempt to prevent the morbidity and mortality. Some factors contributing to risk are quite obvious, but others are very subtle. Thus, care must be taken in definitions, screening programs, and application of the tools available for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n    pdf50p lananhanh123 27-08-2011 41 4 \u00a0\u00a0Download\n\n  \u2022 The medical model emphasises health care and remedial treatment. Greater importance needs now to be attached to primary prevention and health promotion and with which there is a heightened need for people to accept their personal responsibility and individual accountability. Traditional approaches to health have not encompassed sufficiently primary prevention. New models are needed for positive health. These models require a reassessment of value systems in society that enables improved understanding of the WHO slogan: \u2018health is our real wealth\u2019. ...\n\n    pdf300p ti_du_hoang 02-08-2012 35 4 \u00a0\u00a0Download\n\n  \u2022 For comparing Aussiedler incidence and mortality with the German\/Saarland population, indirect standardizati...

Project Y Theatre experiments with the world premiere of Charles Mee\u2019s LIFE, a series of striking moments where characters must face the limits of love, security, and meaning.\n\nHERE Arts Center\nAug 31 \u2013 Sept 2, 2017\n\nwritten by Charles Mee\ndirected by Joey Rizzolo\nwith Hilary Asare, Meg Bashwiner, Jill Beckman, Shelton Lindsay, Nessa Norich, T\n\nGet Tix and Info\n\nWe invite you to join us as we explore LIFE! Project Y will be creating a digital collage in tandem with the live performance! And we want YOU to participate\u2026\n\nClick here to learn how!\n\nAbout the Play\n\nCharles (Chuck) Mee writes plays that, instead of following one developing story, are an accumulation of \u201cimages and music and other events\u201d in contrasting, vivid scenes that make up a theatrical collage. Mee wants to \u201cto invite people to let their minds roam over the material\u2013not only the material that\u2019s onstage, but the material that these other things will make them think about. \u2026 People have to find their own way through and arrive at their own conclusions. This is a democratic process, a participatory process.\u201d\n\nThis collage is also like sampling as Mee incorporates found texts and imagery, particularly visual art references. Mee has said, \u201cI think of those borrowed texts as historical documents, taken from the culture. People are karaokeing, in a way.\u201d\n\nMee\u2019s collages also come from an impulse to capture the complexity and the beauty of life. For years Mee has been quoting Nietzsche and arguing that \u201cpeople make up stories to reassure themselves. The experience of our lives is not a story, it\u2019s a collection of vivid moments. \u2026That\u2019s what our lives are made of. That\u2019s the truth of our lives.\u201d This is the heart of\u00a0Life. And in its juxtaposing collage of scenes, it asks what can we really know, given the impermanence of love, the slipperiness of security, and the evasiveness of meaning? And how should that affect our lives?\n\nThe answers to those questions are yours to decide. And, in the meanwhile, here are words spoken early in the play to keep in mind:\n\nWell, I think what we can say now\nmore than that\nis that everyone\nmeaningless or not\nis a work of art.\nAnd therefore an extraordinary\n\nVisit to learn more.\n\nThis production is a part of [email\u00a0protected]: a curated rental program, which provides artists with subsidized space and equipment, as well as technical support.\n\nProject Y Theatre is supported by The Dramatists Guild, NYSCA, NY Department of Cultural Affairs, The Puffin Foundation, ART\/NY Nancy Quinn Fund, ART\/NY Creative Space Grant.\n\n(Featured Content, News) (No Comments \u00bb)\n\n\u201cNothing Beyond the Light Matters\u201d by Dan McCoy (a Queer Plays Reading)\n\nPosted by MB - April 20, 2017\n\n\n\nJoin us for the next play in our Queer Plays Reading Series this Sunday at 7:30 for a reading of Project Y Playwrights Group member, Daniel McCoy\u2019s newest play, \u201cNothing Beyond the Light Matters.\u201d\n\nNothing Beyond the Light Matters\n\nPlaywright: Daniel McCoy\nDirector: Michole Biancosino\nBrian Silliman\nT. Thompson\nAlex Jacob Wilson\n\n\nIt\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve at Fantasy Now, a porn shop in Southeast Portland. Nolan, a born-again Christian, meets Isaac, a punk anarchist. With the ball about to drop, two lonely souls grapple with spending their last few minutes on Earth together, and discover that the end of the world\u2019s not what it used to be.\n\n\nMcCoy, Daniel headshot\n\n\nDaniel McCoy is a playwright and performer based in New York City whose recent plays include Nothing Beyond the Light Matters, Dick Pix, Perfect Teeth, Cleave and Epimythium. His work has been produced and developed at Primary Stages, Theaterlab, Simple Machine Theatre in Boston, Source Theatre Festival in Washington D.C., the New York International Fringe Festival and many other venues. He is a current member of the Project Y Play Group, IATI Theatre Cimientos 2017, and a regular director for the Writopia Lab Worldwide Plays Festival.\n\nAs an ensemble member of the New York Neo-Futurists, Daniel can be seen writing and performing regularly in The Neo Show (formerly known as Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind), in which he has world-premiered more than 150 very short plays.

Hill) and In the Line by Chiori Miyagawa (directed by Kristin Horton and choreographed by Sonoko Kawahara). Both plays were commissioned by Project Y Theatre Company and written as a response to the November 2016 election. Together they will receive full productions as part of the Women in Theatre Festival, June 1-24th 2017 at The A.R.T.\/New York Theatres.\n\n\nIn Test, by Crystal Skillman, an English teacher in a struggling high school readies her junior students for the most important test of their lives. But when a symbol of hate appears in her classroom, she and two students on either side of the recent election, find their lives forever changed.\n\n\nChiori Miyagawa\u2019s\u00a0In the Line revolves around a woman who drops something while standing in a long line of people. She looks for the lost object as the line transforms into other lines \u2013 people waiting to vote, to buy the newest Nintendo, to get into the hottest restaurant \u2013 as she struggles to keep her original place.\u00a0 When she finally arrives at the front of this line that has shifted time and space, what she finds is a surprise. It is a magical exploration of loss, long lines, and letting go.\n\n\nThe Hrosthvitha Project will feature two nights of staged readings of new commissioned short plays. These adaptations will reclaim a piece of women\u2019s theatre history by highlighting the first female and first German language playwright, Hrostvitha of Gandersham, while also making her work relevant and resonant to a modern audience through fresh adaptations by playwrights Caridad Svich, Pia Wilson, Julienne Hairston, Michole Biancosino, Lia Romeo, Stacie Lents, and Erin Mallon.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Jody Christopherson\n\nCrystal Skillman.
