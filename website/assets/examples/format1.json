Project Y Theatre experiments with the world premiere of Charles Mee\u2019s LIFE, a series of striking moments where characters must face the limits of love, security, and meaning.\n\nHERE Arts Center\nAug 31 \u2013 Sept 2, 2017\n\nwritten by Charles Mee\ndirected by Joey Rizzolo\nwith Hilary Asare, Meg Bashwiner, Jill Beckman, Shelton Lindsay, Nessa Norich, T\n\nGet Tix and Info\n\nWe invite you to join us as we explore LIFE! Project Y will be creating a digital collage in tandem with the live performance! And we want YOU to participate\u2026\n\nClick here to learn how!\n\nAbout the Play\n\nCharles (Chuck) Mee writes plays that, instead of following one developing story, are an accumulation of \u201cimages and music and other events\u201d in contrasting, vivid scenes that make up a theatrical collage. Mee wants to \u201cto invite people to let their minds roam over the material\u2013not only the material that\u2019s onstage, but the material that these other things will make them think about. \u2026 People have to find their own way through and arrive at their own conclusions. This is a democratic process, a participatory process.\u201d\n\nThis collage is also like sampling as Mee incorporates found texts and imagery, particularly visual art references. Mee has said, \u201cI think of those borrowed texts as historical documents, taken from the culture. People are karaokeing, in a way.\u201d\n\nMee\u2019s collages also come from an impulse to capture the complexity and the beauty of life. For years Mee has been quoting Nietzsche and arguing that \u201cpeople make up stories to reassure themselves. The experience of our lives is not a story, it\u2019s a collection of vivid moments. \u2026That\u2019s what our lives are made of. That\u2019s the truth of our lives.\u201d This is the heart of\u00a0Life. And in its juxtaposing collage of scenes, it asks what can we really know, given the impermanence of love, the slipperiness of security, and the evasiveness of meaning? And how should that affect our lives?\n\nThe answers to those questions are yours to decide. And, in the meanwhile, here are words spoken early in the play to keep in mind:\n\nWell, I think what we can say now\nmore than that\nis that everyone\nmeaningless or not\nis a work of art.\nAnd therefore an extraordinary\n\nVisit to learn more.\n\nThis production is a part of [email\u00a0protected]: a curated rental program, which provides artists with subsidized space and equipment, as well as technical support.\n\nProject Y Theatre is supported by The Dramatists Guild, NYSCA, NY Department of Cultural Affairs, The Puffin Foundation, ART\/NY Nancy Quinn Fund, ART\/NY Creative Space Grant.\n\n(Featured Content, News) (No Comments \u00bb)\n\n\u201cNothing Beyond the Light Matters\u201d by Dan McCoy (a Queer Plays Reading)\n\nPosted by MB - April 20, 2017\n\n\n\nJoin us for the next play in our Queer Plays Reading Series this Sunday at 7:30 for a reading of Project Y Playwrights Group member, Daniel McCoy\u2019s newest play, \u201cNothing Beyond the Light Matters.\u201d\n\nNothing Beyond the Light Matters\n\nPlaywright: Daniel McCoy\nDirector: Michole Biancosino\nBrian Silliman\nT.

Hill) and In the Line by Chiori Miyagawa (directed by Kristin Horton and choreographed by Sonoko Kawahara). Both plays were commissioned by Project Y Theatre Company and written as a response to the November 2016 election. Together they will receive full productions as part of the Women in Theatre Festival, June 1-24th 2017 at The A.R.T.\/New York Theatres.\n\n\nIn Test, by Crystal Skillman, an English teacher in a struggling high school readies her junior students for the most important test of their lives. But when a symbol of hate appears in her classroom, she and two students on either side of the recent election, find their lives forever changed.\n\n\nChiori Miyagawa\u2019s\u00a0In the Line revolves around a woman who drops something while standing in a long line of people. She looks for the lost object as the line transforms into other lines \u2013 people waiting to vote, to buy the newest Nintendo, to get into the hottest restaurant \u2013 as she struggles to keep her original place.\u00a0 When she finally arrives at the front of this line that has shifted time and space, what she finds is a surprise. It is a magical exploration of loss, long lines, and letting go.\n\n\nThe Hrosthvitha Project will feature two nights of staged readings of new commissioned short plays. These adaptations will reclaim a piece of women\u2019s theatre history by highlighting the first female and first German language playwright, Hrostvitha of Gandersham, while also making her work relevant and resonant to a modern audience through fresh adaptations by playwrights Caridad Svich, Pia Wilson, Julienne Hairston, Michole Biancosino, Lia Romeo, Stacie Lents, and Erin Mallon.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Jody Christopherson\n\nCrystal Skillman.
