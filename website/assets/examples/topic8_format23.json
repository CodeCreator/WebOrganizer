        "text":"Advanced Dermatology\n\nAdvanced Dermatology\u2019s\u00a0new \u201cmulti-action skin care line\u201d is our clear #1 recommendation.\n\n\u2013 Breakthrough ingredients to reduce the look of wrinkles including forehead wrinkles, laugh lines, crows feet, under eye wrinkles, lip lines and neck wrinkles.\n\u2013 Advanced ingredients help lift and contour your\u00a0cheeks, jawline, and neck for a\u00a0more youthful appearance.\n\u2013 Perfect if you hate the feeling of foundation on your skin and want to naturally achieve clear, flawless\u00a0looking skin.\n\u2013 Helps improve the appearance of dark spots, discolorations, blotchiness, and redness.\n\u2013 Look more rested. Targets the signs of aging and fatigue around the eyes.\n\u2013 It helps visibly minimize the appearance of pores and improves skin texture too.\n\u2013 Here\u2019s what the fuss is about: Most of the time, the skin care products you buy over the counter is going to give you results\u2026 for like, maybe a few hours, and then nothing. It\u2019s almost like you were better off just not using the product in the first place.\u00a0Ever noticed that before?\u00a0That\u2019s because most companies add silicone, which makes the product feel smoother and adds a short-term lift for your skin.\u00a0But once that silicone washes off your face, the product is basically useless.\n\u2013 If you find a product that is silicone based you have two options: 1. Buy it. Just know that it\u2019s going to make you look great for a few hours in the morning and then you\u2019ll be back to square one by lunch. 2. Run as far and fast as you can from anything silicone based and instead search for products that offer long-term\u00a0results.\n\u2013 Advanced Dermatology features a\u00a0breakthrough pro-collagen and elastin formula to give you significantly better results that won\u2019t wash off like those silicone based products.\n\u2013 But Advanced Dermatology has also been designed\u00a0to naturally support\u00a0hyaluronic acid production.\u00a0It might sound scary, but hyaluronic acid is actually the stuff in your skin that kicks wrinkles to the curb. Without it you\u2019d shrivel up in the sun like a raisin.\n\u2013 It\u2019s worth\u00a0noting:\u00a0most skin care products are made of only 5 or 10% anti aging ingredients, meaning that most of what you get is probably either water or silicone.\u00a0That\u2019s why if you\u2019ve ever felt like every product you try just doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t blame it on your skin.\u00a0You wanna pay $95 for a bottle of water?\u00a0If you\u2019re like most people, you probably paid something near $100 for that useless bottle of gunk.\nAdvanced Dermatology isn\u2019t even close to that much. And it\u2019s way better. \u00a0This is an awesome skin care line for the price.\n\u2013 The most advanced\u00a0formulations we have come\u00a0across\u00a0\u00a0We calculated the cost of each\u00a0ingredient,\u00a0this skin care program is easily\u00a0worth several hundred dollars. It contains\u00a0over 30 cutting edge ingredients to fight visible aging and damage. Just one of these ingredients is\u00a0a special Rose Stem Cell that is one of the most expensive anti-aging ingredients on\u00a0the planet. This is why Advanced Dermatology represents excellent value for money.\n\u2013 30 day money back guarantee. If you don\u2019t see dramatic results,\u00a0send it back for a refund.\n\u2013 We highly recommended the Advanced Dermatology skin care line.\n\u2013 Complimentary shipping when you order through their website.\n\n\u2013 Product packaging is a bit too clinical.\n\u2013 Products smell too clinical.\n\nMore about Advanced Dermatology\nAdvanced Dermatology is a breakthrough skin care line\u00a0designed to visibly reduce wrinkles and firm your skin.\u00a0\n\nAdvanced Dermatology contains an absurdly impressive list of ingredients, including multiple obscenely high-tech peptides, growth factors and 30 more\u00a0powerful ingredients \u2013 in high concentrations.\n\nThe truth is, high concentrations of anti-aging\u00a0ingredients are needed to achieve\u00a0youthful firmness. And yet, most skin care products contain small concentrations of the right ingredients.\u00a0Why, then, does Advanced Dermatology contain such high concentrations in comparison?\n\nTo answer this question, you need to take a closer look at how leading cosmetic manufacturers work.\n\nThe fact is, cosmetic manufacturers spend more on marketing than product development. For example, half of the money you pay for a product you buy from a department store goes to the store. Another twenty percent is spent on marketing related costs. Sadly, in most cases, less then one percent is spent on the formulation itself.\n\nIt is outrageous.\n\nTo complicate matters further, most cosmetic manufacturers use active ingredients in trace amounts, due to the high cost. Instead, they utilize specific silicons\u00a0to enhance the way the product looks and feels. But silicone based ingredients only offer short-term cosmetics effects and offer no tangible anti-aging benefits.\n\nTo achieve real results, skin care products need a strong concentration of active ingredients.\u00a0Suppose that, a cosmetic manufacturer took that money and spent it on what is inside, how effective would the product be?\u00a0In our experience, it is what is inside that counts the most.\n\nAdvanced Dermatology, for example, spends the majority of the money you pay for the product on the ingredients inside the product. You won\u2019t find their products in department stores and they certainly don\u2019t spend money on marketing. The result? First, let\u2019s take a look at how Advanced Dermatology works.\n\nHere\u2019s how Advanced Dermatology works\nIt\u2019s important to understand how Advanced Dermatology works.\u00a0This is the type of product where you need to embrace the science.\n\nSo, youthful skin has an abundance of collagen and elastin to keep the skin smooth, firm and plump.\n\nBut, in your 20\u2019s, collagen decreases, elastin breaks down, and cells don\u2019t turn over.\u00a0By age 30, your skin loses half its collagen.\u00a0Once collagen breaks down, the skin loses firmness and elasticity. Resulting in wrinkles, crow\u2019s feet, loss of firmness and dullness.\u00a0At the same time, the layer of skin beneath dermis begins to thin.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way though.\n\nTo combat this, Advanced Dermatology\u00a0incorporates a\u00a0breakthrough formula that works in the skin\u2019s deepest layers to naturally boost collagen production.\n\nIn case you had any doubt, Advanced Dermatology offers a 30 day money back guarantee.\n\nClick here to visit Advanced Dermatology\u2019s website.\n\n\n  1. Cheryl\n\n    I was sceptical at first but WOW! I have now been using Advanced Dermatology for a year now and my skin looks amazing for a 64 year old. I have always taken care of my skin, but I can\u2019t say enough good things about Advanced Dermatology. No gimmicks here, just true results. I give it a 10 of 10. Thanks so much for a really great product.\n\n  2. Jenny\n\n    I\u2019m almost in my 50\u2019s and I have been using this product (advanced dermatology) for about 3 months now and I\u2019m convinced that it really works. However, as I continue using the product, I found that it\u2019s really good so I have decided to order again. The fact that the company does not pay for a celebrity to advertise their product only means that the effectivity of their product is their own advertisement. You cannot buy this product anywhere but only through their website maybe because they dont want it to be adulterated or faked. I hope this review helps you in your decision to give it a try. See it for yourself.\n\n  3. Eleanor\n\n    I originally purchased this from my aesthetician sometime ago. If you haven\u2019t used professional products you might be disappointed initially. I am not talking about high end products from department stores or even skin care products from a spa. I am referring to products from a plastic surgeon or dermatologist.\n\n    First, Advanced Dermatology products aren\u2019t silky and they don\u2019t have any fragrance. I have done a lot of research on their formulations and every ingredient is all about long term anti aging. I can see a number of reviews are saying the same thing. When you look at non professional products most ingredients are things like silicons, thickeners and conditions\u2026 nice to apply but thats all. So if you apply a professional product to your face it wont feel as amazing as the other products because they don\u2019t contain those types of nasty ingredients. Think of their products more like treatments that offer long term benefits.\n\n    Second, the formulas are in airless containers because they contain many active ingredients. Any product in a jar or lotion pump is less effective because most active ingredients don\u2019t survive long when they have been exposed to air. This is the reason Advanced Dermatology products are in airless containers. Make sure any product that you use is in an airless container.\n\n    Third, I recently started buying these products online instead. It looks like the pricing online is more affordable. I don\u2019t understand how this works but they refer to it as an online exclusive for new clients.\n\n    Finally, this is a great product without any doubt. I can definitely see an improvement overall with my skin. To give you some background, I am 60. I have pale skin that is slightly blotchy. Since my 20\u2019s I noticed my laugh lines mainly in pictures but eventually it was pretty obvious when I looked in the mirror. This was being caused because my skin was getting thin. Advanced Dermatology really did make a difference. My skin feels like it has been renewed. It has also improved the pigmentation so I no longer need to use foundation. I can feel the plumpness. Ladies, I love it and highly recommend it!\n\n  4. Rebecca\n\n    I have tried many expensive skin care brands but they don\u2019t work as well as this. I have noticed a big improvement within a few days. It works great for smoothing lines and evening out the complexion.\n\n    I give it 5 out of 5.\n\n    It is a little expensive but worth it.\n\n    I have been getting a lot of compliments from friends and family.\n\n  5. Karrie\n\n    I started using Advanced Dermatology not even a week ago and can already tell a difference! I am 31 years old with newly problematic skin (yay). I honestly could tell a difference within a couple of days. It doesn\u2019t take much of any of the products so... (truncated)",

        "text":"Nails: Hard Candy`s Break Up\n\n4 years ago\n\nThe polish featured here is Hard Candy`s nail polish in the shade \"Break Up\" - a semi-clear, cloudy base with larger pieces of hexagonal opalescent glitter.\n\nI picked this polish up at Walmart, and when I saw it, I was immediately drawn to it. I initially thought that it would have the same effect as Sally Hansen`s Hidden Treasure polish, but after wearing it, it is not the same! Hidden Treasure is a flakies polish whereas Break Up is just hexagonal glitters. The only similarity is that both polishes reflect off shades of gold, yellow\/orange and blue. It`s quite pretty!\n\nI wore this polish alone with Seche Base underneath. To be honest, this polish is quite difficult to apply with! The glitter applies very unevenly because of the uneven distribution. It takes several coats for the polishes to look more evenly distributed on the nails. I think I applied 4 coats to get it to look like that! The removal polish is quite difficult as well. It takes awhile for the glitters to come off, even with using the foil method.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this polish - but only if you can put up with it! Haha. I think it is quite a unique-looking nail polish and I`m sure it will look gorgeous as a topcoat over darker polishes.\n\nSource link:\n\nFollow Luuux\n\nRelated Posts\n\nTrending Beauty",

        "text":"Mini Review: NYX Lingerie Liquid Lipstick is More Like Granny Panties\n\nI just purchased one of the most disappointing name-brand products that I have ever encountered in my life.\n\nWhile\u00a0I was out shopping with my family, we swung by CVS. I walked through the cosmetics section to see if I saw anything that I had been wanting to try, and I saw the NYX Lingerie Liquid Lipstick. I had heard some positive reviews about it but I hadn\u2019t really done any extensive research on it. I decided to get it because it was pretty cheap ($7.90) and because I have the Soft Matte Lip Cream, another matte liquid lipstick by NYX that I absolutely adore, and I figured that the formulas were probably pretty similar.img_0351\n\nThe packaging was very pretty and the lipstick inside of the glossy tube appeared to be a beigy-pinkish-mauve, which was exactly the color I had been wanting. When I got home, I opened the tube and saw the first sign that this product was going to be less than satisfactory. The doefoot applicator had been oddly flattened and matted from the lipstick and made application more difficult. I shrugged it off and hoped that the lipstick itself would be better than the applicator, but unfortunately I was incorrect. The formula was sticky and nearly impossible to take off, and it was drying, flaky, patchy, and pretty much every other adjective that you would hope for your liquid lipstick to not be. After I had applied it, it looked like I had put glue on my lips and rubbed some off. Also, the color was much lighter than I had thought that it would be.img_0367\n\nIf you want a drugstore liquid lipstick, I would just spend the extra two dollars and get the NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream instead of this tacky glue in a bottle that just screams \u201cI\u2019m a middle school student who just discovered makeup.\u201d This product is called Lingerie but I think Granny Panties would be a much more suitable title.\n\nLeave a Reply",
