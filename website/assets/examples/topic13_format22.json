This can be a daunting task but not impossible. Hispanic research is very rewarding and to help you get started there are a few resources you should be aware of to help guide you on your way.\n\nIt is not necessary that you be fluent in Spanish in order to have success in your research. You do however have to take the time learn about the genealogical process. A basic knowledge of the history and geography of Mexico will also prove useful. Learning to recognize key Spanish genealogical words and phrases will also serve you well as you begin your genealogical adventure. The following resources will be of assistance to you as you begin your journey in Hispanic research.\n\n\nResearch resources\n\nIf you are brand new to family history research, it would be advisable to start with a free online introductory class from BYU Independent Study. FamilySearch Wiki: Patterned after Wikipedia this online library is community based where everyone can share something to assist in genealogical research. There are many articles on basic genealogical research and several that are specific to research in Argentina.\n\nBrigham Young University research outline for Argentina available in PDF form is a collection of articles and useful resources for those conducting genealogical research in Argentina.\n\nYou may want to consider the following book that has been designed for both beginning and intermediate researchers in all Hispanic countries. Finding Your Hispanic Roots by George R. Ryskamp (Baltimore: MD, 1997), FHL INTL Book 946 D27r.\n\nLanguage resources\n\n\nDeciphering the records is crucial to having success in Hispanic research. The following resources will help you to read your document and translate it correctly.\n\nThe Spanish Genealogical Word List contains a list of many of the most common words you might find in Spanish records. If you don\u2019t find the word you\u2019re looking for in the word list, you should consult a Spanish-English dictionary. Cassell's Spanish-English, English-Spanish Dictionary. New York: Macmillan Publishers, 1978. (FHL book 463.21 C272c 1978.)\n\nWebsites like Google Translate are also good sources for translating records from Spanish to English. Please beware that any word for word translation prepared by a computer program is likely to have some errors!\n\n\nReading Spanish handwriting can be a challenge for a beginner but with practice your speed and ability to read the records will improve. The following resources will provide you with instruction and tips to help you read Spanish handwritten records.\n\nReading Spanish Handwritten Records is a series of three classes you can view online. In lesson 1 you will learn about the Spanish alphabet. In lesson 2 you learn to recognize names, key words, and dates. In lesson 3 you will explore reading various types of Spanish records.\n\nThe Script Tutorial website sponsored by the Center for Family History and Genealogy at Brigham Young University contains exercises, samples, abbreviations, and lists of names and surnames to guide you as you learn to read Spanish handwriting.\n\nNeed extra help?\n\nIf you get stuck and can\u2019t read a document or you\u2019re not sure where to go next in your research, you can ask for help through these resources.\n\nHispanic Genealogy Research community on Facebook is a page sponsored by FamilySearch and here you may also post a question or upload an image of a document for further assistance.

Even when they teamed up to defeat the same enemy, they always kept a watchful eye on each other. Their fight has been a bitter game of words. The rest of the world stands by in wait while these two powerful forces know they control the fate of the world, yet are unwilling to jeopardize their positions of power on the planets greatest stage. From volatile\u00a0rhetoric to a space race and then the more dangerous race of all - nuclear weapons - these two countries are like resentful cousins who happen to be bitter rivals. They work together when necessary, but otherwise they face each other with a grim mug-mouth.\u00a0\n\nThe Soviet Union didn't exist until 1922, but do you know how long it took the United States to recognize them? If you do, you know how quickly this rivalry began. After World War II, do you know how the Soviets took care of the rest of Eastern Europe? Do you know how the Korean War affected the rivalry between the U.S. and Soviet Union? Or what 1960 event caused tension between the two countries?\n\nWhile tensions between the United States and Russia are at a historic high, it was the 70-year existence of the Soviet Union and the reciprocated bitterness with America that kept the world on constant notice.\n\nTake this quiz to see how much you know about the turmoil of the U.S. and Soviet relations!\u00a0\n\nAbout HowStuffWorks\n\nHow much do you know about how car engines work?

If Legacy thinks the county is incorrect it will let you know.\n\n1) You turn this feature on in Options > Customize > 2. Data Entry.\nOption 2.1 - check the box for Verify USA Counties in Place Names\n\nI keep this ON because this option does two things. It will tell you if you have entered a county that never existed in that state (possibly a simple spelling error or you totally have the wrong name) and it will also tell you if you are entering a county that didn't exist when your event occurred. For example, if I were to enter a death that occurred in Lamar County, Mississippi in 1850 I will get an error message because Lamar wasn't formed until 1904.\n\n2) See the screenshot for information about what the error message can tell you.\n\n\n3) Check your current data by going to Reports > Other Reports > USA County Verification. You can then see if there are any locations in your file that you still need to address. You might have overridden the error message because you weren't sure about the location and you told yourself that you would look into it. If you forgot, it will show up on this report.\n\nMaking sure your locations are accurate is the first step in getting your genealogy database organized. Give it a try and you\u2019ll be on your way to clean data. Any questions? Head for the Facebook Legacy User Group (info below).\n\n\nFind tech tips every day in the\u00a0Facebook Legacy User Group. The group is free and is available to anyone with a Facebook account.\n\nFor video tech tips checkout the\u00a0Legacy Quick Tips page.\u00a0 These short videos will make it easy for you to learn all sort of fun and interesting ways to look at your genealogy research.\n\nMichele Simmons Lewis is part of the technical support team at Millennia, the makers of the Legacy Family Tree software program. With over 20 years of research experience, Michele\u2019s passion is helping new genealogists get started on the right foot through her writings, classes and lectures. She is the former staff genealogist and weekly columnist for the McDuffie Mirror and now authors\u00a0Ancestoring, a blog geared toward the beginner\/intermediate researcher.\n\n\nFeed You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post.\n\nso, when using the USA County Verification Feature when entering data -\n-when the county existed long time ago, but NO longer a county\/changed to a different county name - which do you enter? both? which first? how should you enter\/specify which is which?\n\nYou should always enter the location as it was at the time the event took place. Here is an article that Jim Terry wrote on how you can record both :)\n\nHere's the problem I have ... when I run the county verification tool I get several errors, such as \"Saint Louis, St. Louis (City), Missouri, United States\nThere was never a county by the name of St. Louis (City) in the state of Missouri.\" ... yet when I open the Geo Location Database and search for St. Louis, Missouri the Geo Location database lists the county as \"St Louis (city)\" (and that's the ONLY option I can select). So ... the county verification tool tells me it's wrong, but the geo location database only gives me that county to select. Which one is correct? How can the software provide the location, and then tell me it's wrong?\n\nWhy does legacy not recognize Maine counties as part of Massachusetts pre-1820?\n\nI need an example. Which county in Maine?\n\nThe reason the County Verifier is rejecting it is because of (City). It is true that there is no county in the state of Missouri named \"St. Louis (City)\"\n\nSt. Louis is an independent city. you can record it a couple of ways.\n\nSt. Louis [independent city], , Missouri, United States\nSt. Louis, , Missouri, United States\n\nThe both examples the county is left blank because in this case there is no county. You can add \"independent city\" in square brackets if you want to make it clear that there is no county. When a writer adds something in square brackets that is a signal to the reader that whatever is inside those square brackets is something the writer has added for clarity's sake.\n\nI need an example. Which county in Maine?\n\nCumberland, Hancock, Kennebec, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Somerset, Washington, and York Counties all were part of Massachusetts, United States of America.\nYork was part of Massachusetts Bay Colony, England, from formation until 1686 when it became part of Dominion of New England, England. In 1689 it reverted to Mass. Bay Col., England. York then was part of Mass. Bay Col., Great Britain, from 1707-independence, Lincoln and Cumberland Counties were part of same from 1760-independence. (I'm not sure if independence is 1776 or 1783). All three were then part of Massachusetts, United States of America through 1820. Any of the other counties (see list above) formed before 1820 were also part of Massachusetts.\n\nI am going to email you directly. I did some research and tests on this and I want to explain it all (not enough room here).\n\nIs there any way others can see your response to Jon about Maine counties before 1820?\nAlso, how do we enter any colonial location?\n\nI just wanted to outline the testing for Jon that I had done and what I found. I didn't want to take up that much space here :) I did find that the Maine counties prior to 1820 (and they did exist but in a different state) are causing the County Verifier to say that the county didn't exist (either in ME or MA). I sent everything through to Sherry who is the tech that handles the County Verifier.\n\nColonial locations are interesting because locations were very fluid. Names changed and boundaries changed. I put together a text file of some of the dates and locations and I put it in the Files section on our Legacy Users Group Facebook page. You can join here and then you will have access to the files. It isn't a comprehensive list but it will get you started. Also, if anyone has any further information or additions they can contact me.\n\nThe comments to this entry are closed.",

There are general sites providing on-line instruction in genealogy that can be downloaded and studied at your leisure. Some are available at no cost. The FamilyTreeMaker website ( has an excellent beginners course, and much advanced material that is useful no matter what ethnic group you are researching. FTM also has millions of names in their indexes, some of which are free, and some requiring membership or a payment. I am most familiar with FTM because I use their genealogy programs, however, other sites with similar websites, like (, will also be useful to you.\n\nSites exist for most ethnic groups. Of special interest to those researching Lebanese families is Another appealing site is featuring an interactive map of Lebanon. Do a search on \"Lebanese (or Syrian) Genealogy\" and you will find many sites sure to increase your knowledge of these countries.\n\nNumerous on-line genealogy newsletters are available. Genealogy Today ( and D' ( are two of the best, providing free information, updates, instructional articles and more, with special sites for Italian or German researchers. Cyndis List ( hosts thousands of genealogical websites, many of which will be useful, both for general research methodology and specific ethnic interests.\n\nA Final Caveat\n\nInformation and records found on the Internet should be considered secondary sources, and followed up at the primary source, to make certain the information is accurate. Double-check information you find on the 'Net - before you add it to your family tree -- just as you would information from other secondary sources. Research is only as good as the person doing it, and mistakes happen. Sloppy research happens too.

        "text":"Special Topics\nSlide Show\n\nArchaeologists empty each container and collect its contents, mostly sand\nand bits of sea creatures or shells. We use bucket flotation to separate\norganic remains from heavier inorganic components.\n\nBucket Flotation Procedures to Recover Archaeobotanical Remains\nBy Cheryl Ward, Ph.D.\n\nWhat kinds of plant remains can be recovered from waterlogged archaeological sediments? Leaves, wood, charcoal, fibers, rope, textiles, seeds, dung, nuts, charred beans and grains in addition to small artifacts such as beads, weights, shot and jewelry?A general rule of thumb in working with waterlogged material is that black, brown or golden yellow small objects (1-20 mm long usually) are likely to be plant remains. These can be flat, round, squarish, oval or even easily recognizable nuts or fruit stones. All provide clues to the archaeobotanist and are equally important.\n\nThe most important thing for the flotation worker to remember as the process is conducted is that the seeds and other plant remains are extremely soft and fragile. Any pressure put on the seeds could cause them to break into unrecognizable fragments. The best way to prevent this is to keep your hands away from all the organic material-use water to move the flot (material recovered during flotation) as much as possible.\n\nThe outline below is intended as a rough guide to safe and efficient recovery of waterlogged plant remains from typical shipwreck deposits, e.g. from ceramic containers. Usually, ceramic objects will be full of a mixture of sand, pulverized bits of shell and sea life, wood from the ship, and a selection of plant remains from the container's original contents (perhaps) and the dispersed organic components of the cargo and ship. This process has been used more than 10,000 times by Institute of Nautical Archaeology staff and produces a wide range of archaeobotanical material in terms of species and size\n\nThe dark bits of seeds and other plant remains are soft and waterlogged.\n\nIf the sample size is larger than two liters, or if it includes large foreign objects (shells, sherds, etc.) the whole recovery process will be hastened if you use a set of graduated sieves to cull these large bits. With a screen size of 7-10 mm, all the small plant material will pass through without being damaged as you pour the sample-containing-water from the object through the sieves into your bucket.\n\nCheck for brown and black lumps and bits on the screens-these are probably plant remains and should be put into a labeled container for plant remains unless they are clearly shell\/stone\/artifactual material and require other disposition. Use jeweler's tweezers for this-not your fingers-as the remains will be soft and squishy. It doesn't matter if you can identify these as plant remains or not, incidentally. That will be done later by a specialist who will always be glad to have too much rather than too little to work with.\n\n2) Doing the flotation. This process relies on density. Waterlogged plant remains usually don't float; the floation process causes them to be briefly suspended in water so that they can be separated from the heavier bits of shell\/sand\/etc.\n\nEquipment you will need: two buckets, a pair of nested 1mm sieves, sieves with larger screen sizes, a basin, labels, jars, paintbrush, jeweler's tweezers, water and a place to dump used water and sediment.\n\na) Prepare your receiving bucket by placing the sieves over it. Put water and a waterproof label that will fit into your sample jar into the basin.\n\nb) Fill a \"pouring\" bucket 3\/4ths full of clean water. Add about a liter of your sample to it, using your hand slowly and gently to make the transfer.\n\nc) Using your hand, begin to swirl the water and sediment in the bucket. Don't scrape the bottom or the sides to prevent damage to the seeds, but try to get all the sediment moving. Create a vortex (like when you let water out of a sink or tub).\n\nd) Once the vortex is moving quickly, rapidly pull your hand out, lift the bucket, and pour off the water through the sieves. Try not to get the sediment from the bottom of the bucket into the sieves, but do try to encourage dark bits to get there.\n\ne) Take each sieve individually and submerge its base in the water-filled basin. Try to get the flot into as small an area as possible by gently lifting\/rotating\/submersing the sieve, then turn the sieve over and tap its edges against the basin so the flot falls into the basin. Use water, not your fingers, to push any remaining flot off the sieve. You may have to do it a few times. A squeeze bottle can provide gentle assistance as well.\n\nf) Pour the water from the receiving bucket back into your pouring bucket. Replace the sieves over the empty bucket. Process the same portion of the sample again, and as many times as needed until the sieves no longer catch dark, organic matter.\n\ng) Dump the floated sample onto a series of large sieves and wash thoroughly, check for large plant remains and artifacts, then discard sample.\n\nh) Repeat until the entire sample has been processed.\n\ni) Take the flot-holding basin and slowly pour off the water through nested sieves, leaving the flot and a little water in the basin. Empty the remaining flot, its label and water into a jar. Use water to move the flot, or a small paintbrush, lightly manipulated. You've worked hard to get your sample-don't squash it now. You can let the sample settle, pour off excess water, add more flot, etc. You'll probably do best if you conduct this whole step over a large, clean, dry basin. That way, if anything spills, its is a relatively simple matter to clean it up and you haven't lost any plant remains between the slats of the dock or onto the beach.\n\nj) Storage. If the sample includes resin of any sort, don't add alcohol to the water. We have not had problems with mold or rot, but a 5% solution of alcohol and fresh water will keep any bacteria at bay. Samples should be stored in cool, dry conditions with labels inside and outside their containers. Make sure the lid fits tightly and\/or put a piece of plastic wrap between the jar and its lid to reduce evaporation.",

Keep in mind that whenever we find the mention of a community, we simply add it to our list so that we can go back and do further research. While this has proven a good way of finding communities, it has created more questions than answers. If you can, we would appreciate your help in answering these accumulating questions.\n\nWhere appropriate, please include the GPS coordinates. The easiest way to find the latitude and longitude is to visit our Interactive Map for\u00a0Oakwood.\n\nWe usually switch the map to 'Satellite' mode and zoom-in as needed. You can then move the Map Marker to the desired location (you'll see a cross-hair as you move the Marker). When you release the Marker, the Latitude\/Longitude for the Marker will be found just below the map and to the right. Just copy\/paste those numbers into your note.\n\nThe first point that we would like to make is that our data contains errors. Some of the errors result from our methodologies and others occur while entering our findings. That said, the majority of the errors come from our reference documents, even documents that should be definitive. The problem is identifying the errors. As you read through our pages about\u00a0Oakwood and find errors, please let us know - we want to be accurate.\n\nThe last point that we want to make is that we do our updates in blocks and with over\u00a0160,000 communities in our Gazetteer, it can be months between updates. We just wanted to warn you that if you sent us a note today, it may be days or months before the correction actually appears on our Gazetteer. While this seems to be a long time, please remember that it's just my wife and myself doing the work.\n\nOur Wishlist For Oakwood ...\n\nIn the case of\u00a0Oakwood, we are searching for the following information.\n\n  \u2022 While we have added\u00a0Oakwood to our Gazetteer, we don't have any information about how large it might be or even if it still exists. Is it a cluster of houses and buildings or is the community scattered throughout the area. If it's gone, have all traces of\u00a0Oakwood been erased or is there some kind of indication of where it was located?\n  \u2022 If gone, we use three broad categories to describe its status:\n  \u2022 The community is Historic and there is little to no evidence that can be found at its location.\n  \u2022 A Ghost Town has left some evidence that it existed, but is without residents. At a minimum, there should be foundations or a cemetery. We also use Ghost Town with Ruins to describe when things like buildings or artifacts such as abandoned equipment still remain - in other words, the classic movie Ghost Town.\n  \u2022 We use Shadow Town to describe a community that still has residents, but which had a much larger presence in the past. Like the Ghost Town with Ruins, we use Shadow Town with Ruins when abandoned buildings and\/or artifacts from the communities past can still be found.\n  \u2022 Just a reminder: Ghost and Shadow Towns are frequently located on private property and the owner's rights need to be respected. Always be careful, ruins can have hidden dangers.\n  \u2022 We don't have any estimates of current or past population information for\u00a0Oakwood. If you have it, we need the year with the estimated population (ie- 1870: 20 people; 1880: 68 people; etc).\n  \u2022 How do the people of\u00a0Oakwood refer to themselves (also known as a Denomyn)?<1> For example, a person from Alabama is called a Alabamian. In the same way, how would a resident of\u00a0Oakwood be called?\n  \u2022 Do you know when the community was founded or settled?\n  \u2022 What is the story behind the name of\u00a0Oakwood (also known as a Toponym)?\n  \u2022 Many communities are founded with one name and then eventually change to something else.
