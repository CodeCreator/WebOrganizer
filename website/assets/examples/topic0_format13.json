Already heralded as a wicked invention at the Oscars and favored as a sweet smelling smoke at the Golden Globes, ePuffer thought they were prepared for what would happen next.\n\nTheir stand was nestled snuggly against Sapphire, the largest gentlemen\u2019s club in the world, which ePuffer agree played a part in their astonishing success.\n\nAs entrepreneurs and journalists wandered around the show trying the alcoholic cocktails on offer, their attention inevitably lead to the glamorous booth of Sapphire which sported many sensual half naked girls. After a feast for the eyes and suitably lubricated with alcohol, they moved onto ePuffer for a health conscious cigar to accompany them round the rest of the show.\n\nIn fact the electronic cigars ( in particular the Disposable ECIGAR D1500) were so popular due to the price, flavor, the ease of use, the craving killer and the super sexy appearance that ePuffer sold out in just four hours with two days left to go!\n\nPeople adored being able to linger for longer as they smoked the ePuffer indoors, enjoying the combination of electronic cigarettes and alcohol without producing damaging smoke.\n\nNow many bars, clubs and restaurants have signed up to use ePuffer in their own establishments as they saw first-hand how this way to smoke brought more people to their place. These, and any other, who sign up will benefit from a listing on the ePuffer website so clubbers and diners know where they can go and enjoy an ePuffer cigar indoors.\n\nShawn, the founder of ePuffer is obviously delighted with the results, he says, \u201cWe had to Fedex overnight more products from New York in order to meet demand. People truly enjoyed their eCigar, we\u2019ve made many connections and signed many bars and restaurants as our brand is all about innovation, quality and presentation. Our product will draw more customers to their business, and from our site we will post their info on our website, so any customer in the area who wants to smoke ePuffer inside will choose them over many others.\u201d\n\nAbout ePuffer Inc.\n(\u201ce-cigarette\u201c\/ \u201ce-cigar \u201c\/ \u201cepipe\u201d) is an alternative to smoked tobacco products, such as cigarettes, cigars, or pipes. It is a battery-powered device that provides inhaled doses of nicotine by delivering a vaporized nicotine solution. In addition to nicotine delivery, this vapor also provides a flavor and physical sensation similar to that of inhaled tobacco smoke, while no tobacco, smoke, or combustion is actually involved in its operation.\n\nFor more information please visit: www.ePuffer.com",

After it made me orgasm, I wanted to snuggle up to the Doc Johnson iVibe Select iWand and slip into a beautiful slumber. Had this take on the wand vibrator finally made me understand why some people fall in love with inanimate objects?\u201d\n\nThe article also notes that the iWand is perfect for both singles and couples, \u201cregardless of the gender of your partner\u201d, and that the vibe is easily rechargeable with no clunky wall outlet required.\n\nSaint Thomas ends the article with these final thoughts: \u201cBe prepared: You may have to open up your partnership to a triad to make room for this sex toy. I\u2019m single, but with my [iWand] to get me off and my girlfriends there for emotional support, I basically have all my sexual and emotional needs met this cuffing season\u2014and I don\u2019t even have to meet anyone\u2019s family over the holidays. I believe that this sex toy can change the way we date. From now on, if I\u2019m going to let you into my bed, you\u2019d better have a wonderful personality and be at least as impressive as this vibrator.\u201d\n\nDoc Johnson\u2019s VP of Sales and Marketing, Scott Watkins, said, \u201cGlamour is one of the most popular publications in the world, and a trusted name for women and couples looking to heat up their sex lives. The regular press coverage that our iVibe Select vibes have been receiving (including multiple inclusions in Cosmopolitan and Glamour) have exponentially increased our website traffic\u2014and retailers should prepare for increased demand of our newest iVibe Select vibrators as this especially viral-worthy article continues to gain traction leading up to the holiday (and Valentine\u2019s Day) season.\u201d\n\nClick here to read the full article, \u201cWith This Warming Vibrator, Winter Won\u2019t Be the Only Thing Coming,\u201d on the Glamour website.\n\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment Login",
