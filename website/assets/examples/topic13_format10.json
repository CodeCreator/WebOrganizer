        "text":"01\/25\/2013 08:18 EST | Updated 03\/27\/2013 05:12 EDT\n\nMontreal mummies come to life through facial reconstruction\n\nThe mummies at McGill University's Redpath museum have been on display for more than 100 years. But for the first time, a team of scientists has taken a closer look at the faces behind the bandages.\n\nA team of scientists at the Montreal Neurological Institute used CT scans to create 3D reconstructions of the mummies' faces.\n\nThe facial reconstructions of the three mummies \u2014 a young man, a young woman, and an older white-haired woman, were unveiled on Friday at the Redpath Museum.\n\nOne of the project's most interesting discoveries was evidence of the earliest dental surgery ever performed.\n\nAndrew Wade, a postdoctoral fellow in anthropology at Western University, said researchers saw linen packing on one of the mummies' teeth meant to treat a cavity.\n\n\"It was really exciting because that was a first,\" Wade said.\n\nVictoria Lywood, a forensic artist at John Abbott College, worked with the 3D scans to reconstruct the mummies' faces.\n\n\"I could see the faces on different levels, how they looked without the bandages. It was stunning,\" Lywood said.\n\nResearchers expect the anthropological analyses of the scans will help provide insight into how these people lived and died. Their data will provide information on demographics, social statuses and medical ailments.\n\nLywood said she was surprised to see the mummies did not look like the typical Cleopatra-style Egyptian.\n\n\"These were just ordinary Egyptians,\" she said.\n\nFor months, Lywood worked on the three reconstructed faces out of her home.\n\n\"It gets a little creepy at my place \u2026 Sometimes I have to get up and turn them around,\" she said.\n\nThe mummies, which are estimated to have been first entombed nearly 2,000 years ago, were first scanned in April 2011 at the Montreal Neurological Institute. The high-resolution 3D images were then analysed and used as a basis to create the reconstructions that are now on display.",

As of Tuesday, when the most recent one was installed, eight such patches exist, and the long-planned trail is complete.\n\nMore than 43 states from Oregon to Maine have rural areas dotted with patches. The idea came to New Milford when former Mayor Patricia Murphy \u2014 an avid quilter \u2014 applied for a state Economic Development Grant in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to bring attention to our agricultural history,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWhen you see the patches, they suggest that there is a history beyond everybody\u2019s hustle and bustle. They\u2019re big enough to give you pause.\u201d\n\nThe town was awarded $7,700 by the state\u2019s tourism office in 2014, and Murphy enlisted the help of locals to get the project done.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy to organize, she said. The town needed to enlist barn owners, working with them to design and install the patches.\n\nSusan Bailey, whose family has farmed in Connecticut for four generations, was the first resident to put one up, on a Harris Hill Farm barn in 2015.\n\n\u201cEvery quilt tells a story,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cIt has kind of taken off across the country, and it was our way of tying into the past.\u201d\n\nBailey\u2019s patch, four colorful cows fixed on a red barn wall, symbolizes her family\u2019s history of dairy farming. Although their farm is no longer active, several barns on the trail are, and Bailey hopes the displays will bring traffic to local farm stands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping more people take part in local agriculture,\u201d she said.\n\nVolunteers and town officials are working on a web page and brochure for visitors who would like to tour the town patch by patch. They estimate a formal trail map will be published in September.\n\nOn Smyrski Farm, on Weantinoge Heritage Land Trust, maple leaves recall the area\u2019s two centuries of making sugar.\n\nBehind Town Hall, Murphy\u2019s design sits on a red barn that historians say likely housed tobacco in the early 1900s, when New Milford\u2019s cash crop was Havana seedleaf.\n\nOut of more than 4,000 designs in a quilt-patch encyclopedia, Murphy picked a blue, green and red one for its name, Mayor\u2019s Garden.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all blacktop back there,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be nice to have a garden.\u201d; 203-731-3411; @bglytton",

In less than an hour the English Parliamentarian army, under the command of Oliver Cromwell, defeated the Scottish Covenanting army who supported the claims of Charles II to the Scottish throne.\u00a0\n\nAlthough the exact figures are not known, it is thought that around 1,700 Scottish soldiers died of malnutrition, disease and cold after being marched over 100 miles from the South East of Scotland to Durham, in North East England, where they were imprisoned in Durham Cathedral and Castle, by then disused for several years. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat happened to their bodies has been a mystery for almost 400 years, but the Durham University researchers believe they have begun to solve the puzzle. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn November 2013, during construction of a new caf\u00e9 for the University\u2019s Palace Green Library, on the City\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage Site, human remains were uncovered by Durham University archaeologists who were present throughout the building work. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWoman assembling the bonesNORTH NEWS\n\nThe delicate process of assembling the bones\n\nWhen we had the results of the first radiocarbon dating tests we had a very broad date range and were not in a position to draw a definitive conclusion\n\nDr Andrew Millard\n\nThe jumbled skeletons of at least 17 and up to 28 individuals were subsequently excavated from two burial pits (a 29th individual was not exhumed).\n\nSince then the researchers have been carrying out a wide range of tests to try and establish their identities.\u00a0\n\nExperts initially considered that most of the evidence was consistent with the bodies being those of the Scottish soldiers but could not draw a firm conclusion from research conducted in 2014 because initial radiocarbon dating analysis indicated a slightly earlier date of death than the Dunbar battle. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHowever, further radiocarbon dating analysis of four additional samples, which were carefully selected to ensure a more precise result, in combination with the fact that some of the prisoners had smoked clay pipes - known to be in common use in Scotland after 1620 - has concluded that the date of death was between 1625 and 1660.\u00a0\n\nWhen these dates are combined with the nature of the graves; the results of earlier scientific and observational tests that established the adult skeletons were all male; the fact that the skeletons were predominantly aged between 13-25 years old; and the skeletons were of likely Scottish origin according to isotopic analyses, all this points to their identification as the prisoners from the Dunbar battle. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSkeletons of 17th Century Scottish soldiers found in mass graves\n\nA team of experts from Archaeological Services Durham University \u2013 the University\u2019s commercial archaeology consultancy unit - and academics from the departments of Archaeology and Earth Sciences, worked together to excavate and analyse the skeletons.\u00a0\n\nThe excavation and research were funded by Durham University.\u00a0\n\nDr Andrew Millard, senior lecturer with Durham University\u2019s Department of Archaeology, said: \u201cProving a theory in archaeology involves assembling lots of different types of evidence and piecing the jigsaw together so that we can make an informed assessment. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen we had the results of the first radiocarbon dating tests we had a very broad date range and were not in a position to draw a definitive conclusion as to the identity of the skeletons, which is why we carried out further tests. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cTaking into account the range of detailed scientific evidence we have now, alongside historical evidence from the time, the identification of the bodies as the Scottish soldiers from the Battle of Dunbar is the only plausible explanation.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe battle left anywhere between 300 and 5,000 dead. Modern calculations suggest that an estimated 6,000 Scottish soldiers were taken prisoner with about 1,000 of those who were sick and wounded then released to go home. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nJaw and teeth from a skeletonNORTH NEWS\n\nThe remains of a 17th Century skeleton\n\nAbout 1,000 of the men are believed to have died en route to Durham from a combination of hunger, exhaustion and gastric problems \u2013 probably dysentery. Others were executed, while some escaped. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAround 3,000 Scottish soldiers in total were then imprisoned in Durham Cathedral and Castle, at a time when the Cathedral was empty and abandoned, its Dean and Chapter having been evicted and worship suppressed by order of Oliver Cromwell, as was the case with all English Cathedrals at that time. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAn estimated 1,700 prisoners from the battle died and were buried in Durham and experts say that there are potentially many more burials nearby. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nRichard Annis, senior archaeologist, Archaeological Services Durham University, said: \u201cThis is an extremely significant find, particularly because it sheds new light on a 365-year old mystery of what happened to the bodies of the soldiers who died. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cTheir burial was a military operation: the dead bodies were tipped into two pits, possibly over a period of days. They were at the far end of what would have been the Durham Castle grounds, as far as possible from the Castle itself - they were out of sight, out of mind. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt is quite possible that there are more mass graves under what are now University buildings that would have been open ground in the early to mid-16th Century.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Durham University team, with Durham Cathedral, will be working with partners and interested parties to determine what will happen to the remains of the Scottish soldiers, and an appropriate commemoration. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nBones laid out on a tableNORTH NEWS\n\nThe test results have revealed the staggering age of the bones\n\nThese discussions are likely to include the Church of Scotland, since the prisoners would have been predominantly Scottish Presbyterians. Remembrance prayers will be said at Durham Cathedral tomorrow (Thursday, September 3),\u00a0\n\nthe anniversary of the Battle of Dunbar. Canon Rosalind Brown, of Durham Cathedral, said: \u201cThere is a plaque at Durham Cathedral in commemoration of the Scottish soldiers, which was dedicated in November 2011 on St Andrew\u2019s Day.\n\nThe discovery of the bodies and the conclusion that they are some of the Scottish soldiers is of great significance.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Cathedral will work closely with all interested parties to determine the most appropriate course of action for the burial of the soldiers in a manner appropriate to their Christian tradition.\n\n\"We are particularly mindful of descendants of the Scottish soldiers and hope and pray that this new information can bring solace.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf considered appropriate, there could be further research work to determine further biographical details and discover more about the lives the soldiers led prior to their involvement in the Battle of Dunbar, although this will require additional funding.\n\nThe bodies will eventually need to be reburied according to the terms of the exhumation licence issued by the Ministry of Justice.",

Discovered around mid-July of this year by ATV'ers driving along the coastline, the grouping of sod houses became exposed from violent fall storms last year.\n\nAfter reports started pouring in to various organizations of a sod house with exposed wood and many artifacts lying on the beach, the necessary actions were put into place to prepare a proper archaeological dig.\n\nThrough collaboration between Ukpeagvik I\u00f1upiat Corporation (UIC), UIC Science, the North Slope Borough, and UMIAQ LLC, the dig at Walakpa received enough funding to begin excavation in mid-August. While the first two weeks involved mostly removal of top layers of sod, the next month was devoted to clearing out and deciphering the many layers of the sod structure that balances precariously above the coast of the Arctic Ocean.\n\nJensen has lived in Alaska for over two decades, and specializes in Arctic archaeology.?As lead scientist at UIC Science LLC in Barrow and with more than 35 years of archaeological experience, Jensen is very familiar with excavations in harsh climates. Due to very brief summers and early freeze-up, excavating sites in the Arctic requires dedicated and expeditious work.\n\n\"Arctic archaeology is pretty labor intensive and expensive,\" she says.\n\nThanks to a RAPID grant from the National Science Foundation, Jensen will be able to devote part of this winter to lab work, seeking carbon dating of artifacts found at the site. Most of this will be done by comparing caribou bone to ivory artifacts such as simple ivory harpoons and spear tips.\n\nFaced with many obstacles such as rainy weather, high tides, procuring ATV's, and enough able bodies to excavate, the excavation moved forward through all of the difficulties and digging began at the end of July. After setting up a tent for equipment and staking off the area, layer by layer was revealed until a wooden floor was exposed and several pieces of driftwood were removed in order to check their rings for carbon dating to establish an approximate date of the site.\n\nWhile the current estimated age of the sod house places it possibly as early as 500 A.D., this particular area has been inhabited by I\u00f1upiat people for at least 3,500 years. In 1968, Dennis Stanford led a partial excavation of a group of sod homes in the same area, albeit further back on the tundra and away from the beach.\n\nThis summer, Jensen and her crew were able to establish that the area they were working on is a midden, or garbage pit. While a garbage pit may not sound very important or appealing, this kind of well-preserved ancient find provides an extraordinarily valuable snapshot into the history of I\u00f1upiat people. While oral and written history is important, archaeology provides a very unique perspective on lessons we may not otherwise learn.\n\n\"There are some things that they don't teach in school,\" Jensen said. \"Some things you can learn from archaeology that don't really get passed on in stories because they're so routine.\"\n\nLooking forward to next summer, Dr. Jensen is considering ways to expedite the process at the fragile and exposed site. Some ideas for making more headway on excavation are camping at the site and getting field workers to come in from places outside of Alaska. Students coming to Barrow for field school will no doubt leave with incredible insight on the importance of the subsistence way of lifestyle in the Arctic. Setting up an exchange like this may be possible through working with Ilisagvik College in Barrow and getting grants to get students out in the field.\n\nThe dig at Walakpa is protected by state and federal law and by the Archaeological Resources Protection Act. At the close of the season, the archaeologists were careful to protect the site for next summer.\n\nSteps to ensure that the site remains uncompromised until next summer involved waiting for the ground to freeze up, laying down a layer of insulation, covering it with a tarp, securing the tarp with stakes and rocks and building a makeshift barricade against potentially violent sea storms.\n\nWhile the threat of Mother Nature wiping out the site this fall is real, and archeologists and those interested in the valuable information the site contains can only hope that it will remain intact so that further insight into the history of I\u00f1upiat people may be gained.\n\n\nCopyright 2017 The Arctic Sounder is a publication of Alaska Media, LLC.
