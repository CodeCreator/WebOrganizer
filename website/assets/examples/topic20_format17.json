However, for this sort of situation on a UNIX system, generally all you would have to do is restore the filesystem backup and boot ASE. On Windows, to restore registry entries, I'd guess that you might have to reinstall the ASE software. You can presumably download from SAP the same patch you were running on before this event and run the installer after restoring the file system and tell it to install in the same place. This would likely restore all the registry entries created by an initial install.\n\nTry that and see if you can at least get ASE booted, we can then try working out what needs to be done to resolve any finer-detailed issues.\n\n\n10 |10000 characters needed characters left characters exceeded\nTilman Model-Bosch\nMar 09 at 08:06 AM\n\nI think you can install a completely new SAP system using SAPINST. Make sure DB layout is exactly the same as the original one.\n\nOnce it is up an running replace the new device files of ASE with those of the file system backup.\n\nHopt this helps\n\n\n10 |10000 characters needed characters left characters exceeded",

The graph below works well in showing how many are eligible for a survey (green) vs. how many were actually mailed a survey (orange).\n\n\nThe customer would like me to add a bar to this graph to show the number of people who were eligible for a survey but were not mailed one (thus, I\u2019d be adding a bar to show the difference between the green and the orange bars already present).\n\nGreen bar: COUNT ({Eligible})\n\nOrange bar: This is simply a sum of the column containing either a 0 (no survery mailed) or 1 (survey mailed) : SUM ({MAILED})\n\nThe report has parameters for Country, Date, City (in that order) and is set for all countries.\n\nOK, so the basic core logic is very simple since I just need a formula to show : COUNT ({Eligible}) - SUM ({MAILED}). The trick is to getting this formula to group on the graph in a way that corresponds to each month.\n\nAs a 1st step in this process, I made a formula in an attempt to show just the Count of customers that are Eligible for that month. Since I already have a green bar showing the count of customers each month, I was hoping in my experiment here that my formula would also show the exact same count of eligible customers for each month. Here is the formula\n\nCOUNT({Command.ELIGIBLE},{Command.EVENTDATE}, \"monthly\")\n\nI get results on my graph as shown below but the count of customers only includes the count from the 1st city for each month (instead of the entire country for that month). I am not sure what to do since the formula does not appear to accept multiple groupings.\n\n\nAnyway\u2026 I hope I am making sense and that you might have some suggestions for me. What I want to do seems so simple (calculate the difference between the green and orange bars) so that I can add a bar to the graph showing the customers who were eligible for a survey but did not receive one (seems simple but struggling to achieve) Many Thanks!\n\na1.jpg (161.7 kB)\na2.jpg (181.7 kB)\n10 |10000 characters needed characters left characters exceeded\n* Please Login or Register to Answer, Follow or Comment.\n\n1 Answer\n\nBest Answer\navatar image\nFormer Member Oct 24, 2017 at 02:34 PM\n\nNever mind....I was able to figure it out.\n\n10 |10000 characters needed characters left characters exceeded",
