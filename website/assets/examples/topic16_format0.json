        "text":"\u201cThis sense of unrootedness and disorientation may stem largely from an aesthetic dissonance between Fassbinder and Genet [whose novel Querelle de Brest was adapted by Fassbinder], both in terms of agenda and the times in which they were working. Genet\u2019s novels allow the reader no ironic distance (though they employ irony in its various forms); even when they are explicitly self-referential they are intended to envelop the reader, to overwhelm him\/her with perverse beauty and extravagant wordplay. In Genet\u2019s Querelle [...], homosexuality is equated with crime and perversion not so much, as Fassbinder scholar Wallace Watson claims, because Genet was \u2018homophobic\u2019, but because Genet was writing within a tradition of transgressive literature in which depravity and degradation are presented as potentially transcendent, even utopian [...]. As such, even while it\u2019s important to acknowledge the political underpinnings of much of his writing, Genet\u2019s novels were very much about transgression and homosexuality.\n\nBy contrast, Fassbinder\u2019s \u2018gay\u2019 films that predate his Querelle are never about homosexuality; they merely focus on gay characters. These characters are no more or less moral, no more or less perverse, than their heterosexual counterparts in the same or other films. When his characters seek transcendence or wax utopian, he nearly always maintains an ironic distance and signals well in advance of actual events that their attempts to transcend are doomed by their own near-sightedness, or inarticulateness, or selfishness. Similarly, his films seldom reward the violence of his characters. He does not present physical violence as ecstatic: while his characters sometimes find a kind of ecstasy in their own masochism, they neither transcend the limits of their personalities nor succeed in transforming themselves. For Fassbinder, these self-destructive desires are entrapping, not liberating. Perhaps most significantly, Fassbinder\u2019s plays and films share a consistent distrust of anything that smacks of utopianism, which he seems to equate again and again with fascism.\u201d\n\nFrank Episale1\n\n\nThroughout the film the figure of Querelle remains unaltered. He does not seem to suffer from the pressure of events, nor does he bow down to the demands of social life: in the brothel, at the police station, on the boat, facing his superior, he always appears in a pair of cloth trousers, his torso in a tight vest that sets off his muscles. Feline and sure of himself, Querelle\u2019s poses glorify his body. Querelle carries his body erect, statue\u2010like, never slouching or bending, no matter what the circumstances. This permanent refusal to bow to the demands of the system is a sign of an identity that escapes any normalization. But once again in Fassbinder, the cost of resistance to outside determination \u2013 the cost of otherness \u2013 is solitude. In fact, Querelle is a being entirely apart; he is on the margins of a community whose rules he rejects. Murder and betrayal underpin his identity and guarantee his total separation from the group and its codes.\n\nClaire Kaiser2\n\n\nQuerelle produces a queer male community that appears to be organized around sameness yet is not, its group irreducible to a single identity. Scarcely characters, or even gay characters, these male figures seem to embody tensions and charges that move in a number of different directions at once, directions not adequately covered by categories of sex. (According to Genet\u2019s biographer, Edmund White, Querelle de Brest was \u2018a violent story of homosexual love among heterosexual men.\u2019) Fassbinder, who consistently minimized the importance of identity politics even while dramatically staging the obstacles experienced by people of those very identities, averred of Querelle: \u2018It is not a film about murder and homosexuality. It\u2019s a film about someone trying, with all the means that are possible in society, to find his identity.\u2019\u201d\n\nCaryl Flinn3\n\n\nEach man kills the thing he loves\u2026\nSome do it with a bitter look\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss\nThe brave man with a sword.\n\nEach man kills the thing he loves\u2026\nSome kill their love when they are young,\nAnd some when they are old;\nSome strangle with the bands of Lust,\nSome with the hands of Gold.\n\nOscar Wilde\u2019s \u2018The Ballad of Reading Gaol\u2019 which is set to music in Querelle\n\n\nMore than just being adept at artful provocations of the right and left (sometimes simultaneously), the particular transgressive nature of [Jean] Genet\u2019s writing \u2013 inverting identities, or featuring those that get stuck halfway \u2013 shaped Fassbinder\u2019s work just as much as Sirk\u2019s use of space.\n\nViolet Lucca4\n\n  \u2022 1.

Meaning and narrative : a phenomenological enquiry, with reference to psychotherapy. (Unpublished Doctoral thesis, City University London)\n\n\nThe thesis is grounded in Heideggerian phenomenology. It examines the existentiale of meaning in Heidegger's ontology of Dasein of the 1920s and proposes that the concept of narrative can clarify our understanding of meaning in human life. Narrative theory in turn is critically examined and the importance of the difference between the spoken and written word is elucidated. It is demonstrated that the theoretical understanding of narrative has been distorted by the acceptance of literary narrative as paradigmatic. The primordial form of narrative is shown to be oral. A commentary on Heidegger's analysis of boredom is undertaken and it is shown that the essential structure of narrative is given by the ecstatic temporality of Dasein that is not bored. The event of non-boring oral storytelling is analysed in detail and shown to be a particular existentiell modification of Dasein as being-with. In this event Dasein is called to its own authenticity and transposed into the Da of the story. In the final chapter links are made to the theory and practice of psychotherapy and of performance. The existentiell transformation of Dasein in a well-told oral storytelling event is shown to be the therapeutic essence of psychotherapeutic dialogue. Insight on its own is not curative; psychotherapeutic change is dependent on the way in which a patient is able to tell their story. Only by taking up authentic possibilities is the client's authentic future freed. Similarly in public performances of theatre or storytelling the mysterious phenomena of audiences being transported, uplifted and unified are revealed to be instances of the same existentiell transformation. We conclude by indicating the significance of our findings for philosophy and narrative theory and highlighting the importance of the untranscribable meaning of oral discourse.\n\nPublication Type: Thesis (Doctoral)\nSubjects: H Social Sciences > HM Sociology\nDepartments: School of Arts & Social Sciences > Sociology\nPDF - Accepted Version\nDownload (17MB) | Preview\n\n\n\nDownloads per month over past year\n\nView more statistics\n\nActions (login required)\n\nAdmin Login Admin Login",

        "text":"[Report] The 25th Tokyo Colloquium of Cognitive Philosophy (TCCP)\n\n14 April, 2011 TSUTSUI Haruka\n\nThe speaker of the 25th TCCP was Iv\u00e1n Dar\u00edo Gonz\u00e1lez-Cabrera (The University of Tokyo). The title of his presentation was \"Explaining morality: The 'is-ought' problem and the naturalistic fallacy\".\n\nThere are two famous arguments against moral naturalism: the Humean 'is-ought' distinction and Moore's naturalistic fallacy. Gonz\u00e1lez-Cabrera offers counter-arguments to them from the viewpoint of evolutionary ethics.\n\nFirst, Hume's Law prohibits inference from factual premises (\"is\") to prescriptive conclusion (\"ought\"), which implies that ethical claims cannot be justified within the naturalistic framework. Gonz\u00e1lez-Cabrera employs A. Gewirth's argument and claims that the derivation of \"ought\" from \"is\" is not controversial if there is a goal related to a proposed \"ought\" statement.\n\nSecond, Moore's naturalistic fallacy shows that the question \"what is (moral) good?\" cannot be answered by an appeal to non-moral properties. Gonz\u00e1lez-Cabrera points out that Moore's analytic project overlooks multiplicity of our common-sense notion of moral goodness. The question \"what is (moral) good?\" can be answered in a naturalistic way if it is interpreted not as \"what is the common-sense notion of 'good'?\" but as \"how we should make a theoretical notion of goodness?\"\n\nThese two points are connected by evolutionary ethics. It explicates morality as a product of natural selection. Here, cooperation plays a role as the goal of moral \"ought\" because of its contribution to survival and reproduction. Evolutionary ethics is an effective naturalist theory which satisfies the requirement for a theory about what is moral goodness.\n\nEvolutionary ethics indeed lends a powerful support for moral naturalism. An important question would be how thoroughly it can account for our moral practice, especially in aspects which are unique to human cooperative behavior.\n\n(Haruka TSUTSUI)\n\n  \u2022 HOME>\n    \u2022 Blog>\n      \u2022 [Report] The 25th Tokyo Colloquium of Cognitive Philosophy (TCCP)\n\/\/Page Top",

        "text":"LeFavour, \"Acting 'Natural': Vanity Fair and the Unmasking of Anglo-American Sentiment\"\n\nSullen Fires Across the Atlantic:\nEssays in Transatlantic Romanticism\n\nActing \"Natural\": Vanity Fair and\nthe Unmasking of Anglo-American Sentiment\n\nCree LeFavour, New York University\n\n  1. A popular hit in the United States, W.M. Thackeray\u2019s Vanity Fair is useful for underlining how one of the staples of the sentimental novel\u2014the training of the mind and \"heart\" that Thackeray so mercilessly mocks as artificial\u2014is itself implicated in so many mid-nineteenth century Americans\u2019 expression of anxiety over female novel-reading. In this context, Becky Sharp\u2019s \"naturalness\" and her explicit rejection of books and female self-improvement at once invite a reconsideration of the naivet\u00e9 and simplicity critics have often assumed in their discussions of American domestic fiction, while at the same time drawing attention to the contentious debates over the moral status of novels themselves and the kind of cultural work they did.\n\n  2. I have chosen Vanity Fair as an example of a popular British reprint during this period because Thackeray\u2019s cynical manipulation of the sentimental genre invites analysis of the period\u2019s dominant historiography that posits a literary landscape dominated by American sentimental fiction. Vanity Fair\u2019s strong presence in the American market invites the dissolution of the monochromatic sentimentality that critics still too often expect of American women\u2019s novels at mid-century, while Thackeray\u2019s novel\u2019s popularity in the U.S. provides an opportunity to examine what critics, and presumably readers, valued about novels and why. In other words, I use Becky Sharp to approach the problem of how British reprints alter the popular American literary market precisely because she is such an overtly anti-sentimental character. Becky raises the question of the place of feminine individualism in literature, or, as Gillian Brown writes, \"the alignment of the individualistic self and its representations with anti-sentimentalism\" (Brown 136). The traditional identification in American literary history of popular literature with a tame, feminized domesticity, and of individualism and the integrity of self with more \"literary,\" masculine works of fiction, is nicely spliced by a figure such as Becky. Because she is so self-interested, a reading of her in the American context invites an analysis of the relation between her authenticity or \"naturalness\" as represented by Thackeray and her status as a popular, if reviled, female figure in a wider spectrum of reading. In turn, the value of Thackeray\u2019s narrative being perceived as \"true to life\" or \"realistic\" by antebellum American critics is placed in opposition to the troubled representation of authenticity in American sentimental culture.\n\n  3. Put very simply, it is the struggles with natural passion and raw impulses, and the training of the mind and \"heart,\" that is at the center of much of this period\u2019s \"sentimental\" writing, just as the same struggle with passions\u2014in which the battle is lost\u2014predominates the widely read sensation and subversive fiction that David Reynolds has identified in Beneath the American Renaissance. Vanity Fair\u2019s explicit rejection of female self-improvement in this context invites a reconsideration of the naivet\u00e9 and simplicity critics have often assumed in their discussions of American domestic fiction. Indeed, sustaining the construct of an enclosed body of \"domestic\" or \"sentimental\" fiction that comprised the whole of American women\u2019s reading has long since been shown to be untenable. And yet, the idea that popular female reading was quite explicitly defined in terms of British reprints throughout the 1850s remains untested.\n\n  4. Reprinted in the United States by Harper & Brothers in 1848, the first volume of Vanity Fair was issued on July 29, with volume two on August 19 of the same year. For this first American edition, illustrated by the author, one hundred pounds was probably paid for proofs. Later that year, Harper issued a one-volume edition, which sold for $1 in paper and $1.25 in cloth (Dzwonkoski 195). In the absence of a copyright agreement with England, under the period\u2019s \"courtesy of the trade\" agreements, Harper\u2019s payment should have secured their sole right to publish Vanity Fair in the American market. As was frequently the case, this \"courtesy\" was not entirely respected. In fact, even in the relatively civilized publishing atmosphere of the late 1840s, it did not take long for other editions of Vanity Fair to appear, each priced at $1. The first is advertised from the Cincinnati firm H.B. Pearson in 1854, and the other is from the New York publisher, Bunnel and Price, available no later than 1854 (Tidball 7; Vose 124). In addition, the German firm Tauchnitz did not adhere to what it regarded as an American practical agreement, even though Tauchnitz did publish its books in the United States. The three-volume Tauchnitz edition of Vanity Fair was advertised in the book industry trade paper of the day, The Publisher\u2019s Circular and Weekly Gazette in 1857 at 40 cents a volume, along with the works of Dickens and Bront\u00eb (Publisher\u2019s Circular 27).\n\n  5. Harper\u2019s right to exclusive publication of Vanity Fair was not maintained, and yet Harper\u2019s market share of the reprint business was high and, despite the presence of two or more small competitors, it is apparent that Harper itself did a brisk business in printing and reprinting Vanity Fair throughout the 1850s, including multiple printings dated 1848, 1857, and 1860 (Union Catalog 512-3). This does not mean that Harper only issued the novel in these years. Rather, it means Harper issued the novel with a new title page in these years, reusing the initial printing\u2019s 1848 title-page plate in subsequent printings for reissue through 1857. It is impossible to say, therefore, how many times Harper published Vanity Fair during these years. Vanity Fair was issued again and again by Harper over the course of the 1850s but because the general dating practices of the period are inconsistent, finding a complete count of either various publishers\u2019 editions or Harper copies of Vanity Fair is not possible.\n\n  6. In the absence of absolute numbers, reconstructing Vanity Fair\u2019s rank in the marketplace argues for a brief analysis of that marketplace during this period as well as an assessment of the novel\u2019s critical and cultural impact in print. The novel\u2019s sales in the United States arose in no small part out of American readers\u2019 long dependence on British fiction, which in turn was in part a result of market conditions.\n\n  7. Thackeray, whose fame as a novelist was made on both sides of the Atlantic by Vanity Fair, did not simply achieve fleeting recognition but became an important cultural referent in a nation preoccupied with propriety, sincerity, and the moral dangers exemplified by Bunyan\u2019s and Thackeray\u2019s Vanity Fair. High rates of literacy in the United States compared to England helped to create a healthy publishing industry that was largely dependent on reprinting British books. As I have argued, this fact forms the foundation of debates over the passage of an international copyright law, with laborers\u2019 concerns, and concerns about sustaining the industry from top to bottom, providing the most consistent and compelling reasons for opposing passage of what might seem (and certainly seemed to Dickens) to be a just and fair law. But Thackeray and Dickens both benefited enormously from the reprinting of their books in the United States: they were paid for advance sheets, rights to serial reproduction, and later their American tours were money-making ventures.\n\n  8. As might be expected of such a widely read work, Vanity Fair was frequently referenced and reviewed, but it was given decidedly mixed notices from critics. Not only was the novel noted in short and long reviews when first published, it was discussed again and again as critics surveyed Thackeray\u2019s work as a whole during his lecture tours and compared it with his subsequent novels, including Pendennis, The Virginians, and The Newcomes (Flamm 56-9). These often contradictory reviews document the novel\u2019s visibility and presence in the American market, which I will discuss at greater length below, and they provide an opening into the values and priorities of the era\u2019s reviewers. While these values are certainly not identical to readers\u2019 values, some correspondence can be claimed where dominant themes can be recognized and shown to be widely shared. I want to underline two points: first, the emphasis on and appreciation of \"realism\" and second, the predominant interest in the morality or immorality of Becky Sharp and her perceived effect on readers.\n\n  9. These two points may seem disparate, but they are in fact linked by the still somewhat tenuous positioning of novels in the culture. Because morality is frequently characterized by critics and commentators as an intrinsic quality of a text that cannot be separated from that text\u2019s social effects, these effects are perceived as ineffective in the absence of \"realism.\" What I mean by this is what must be called \"literary\" standards cannot be separated from moral judgment. Given the still-contingent status of novels as a legitimate form of culture, their perceived role in shaping female morality and decorum, the positive social effects of novel reading were linked to certain standards of verisimilitude and were not seen to occur at all in overwrought, implausible, or absurd narratives. Realism, then, was cause for praise, as a reviewer notes in an article titled \"Novels of the Season\" in The North American Review (October 1848):\n\n    Of all the novels on our list, Vanity Fair is the only one in which the author is content to represent actual life. His page swarms with personages whom we recognize at once as genuine. It is also noticeable, that Thackeray alone preserves himself from the illusi... (truncated)",

But can I relive those days? Is it possible to step back into those times when there was no time for remembering what normal life was like, those days when we adapted to chaos and struggled for survival...?

'This is my new manuscript' he explained. 'But why did you take it for this walk?' 'You must understand that this briefcase is the most important thing to me,' he said. 'I cannot risk losing it. It is the manuscript that must be saved. It is more important than I am.'\nLisa Fittko, \"The Story of Old Benjamin,\" (Benjamin, 1982, 5\/2, 1187)\nAnd always in the name of the salvation of the trace, here of the manuscript to be saved, at the instant of death, during the Second World War, the following, which Michel Lisse has also brought to my attention:\"Whatever happens, the manuscript must be saved. It is more important than my own person.\" (Walter Benjamin to Lisa Fittko, cited by Bernard Witte, Walter Benjamin: Une Biographe, trans.

His papers were not in order. He lacked the requisite exit visa from France\u2014a visa that had become essential only that day. He presents his papers and the border guards reject them. He is forced to spend the night at a local hotel, where, later that night, he dies. His death was, perhaps, from natural causes. It was, perhaps, a suicide. It was, perhaps, as a very few conjecture, murder.\n\n[2] As Momme Brodersen, his biographer, tells us, in a letter dated 26 May 1939 the German Embassy in Paris had been informed that the Gestapo's request for Walter Benjamin's expatriation had been granted (Brodersen, 1996, 240). Thereafter Benjamin had essentially been on the run, joining an ever-growing flow of stateless persons or apatrides who were fleeing to the West\u2014not quickly, but in an achingly slow relation to the German advance. Rumors were rife, and as the numbers swelled, the various authorities demanded more and more papers of these refugees. Doors opened and closed, opened and closed, and then closed for good.

[iii]\n\n[3] In Port-Bou, Benjamin reached the end of the line. He made four phone calls (we know not to whom). He wrote one last letter, which was destroyed and then reconstructed from memory. And that night, he died. Among the objects in his possession was a black leather briefcase. This briefcase has since gone missing. Its whereabouts remain unknown. There was for a few years a grave, it is said, but this grave went missing also. Now there is a monument that you may visit.\n\n[4] In 1980, by chance, it came to light that there had been, perhaps, a manuscript in the briefcase, a manuscript that Benjamin is said to have said was \"more important\" than his \"own person.\" But already, on September 26, 1940, this manuscript had gone missing. There is no mention of it in the official records that such hotel deaths occasion. It remains missing to this day.\n\n[5] Understandably, the news that there had been and perhaps that there remains, still, a manuscript, that this briefcase had been, all along, as it turns out, a thoroughly competent briefcase, a briefcase that could still, perhaps, under the right circumstances, and with a little luck or a lot of archival digging, be opened, and the manuscript retrieved, has caused much excitement. Benjamin's editors have inquired into its whereabouts. All manner of writers have ventured to Port-Bou in search of it or of something. When they get there and find nothing, draw a blank, they set about supplementing its absence with their own texts. Benjamin's briefcase becomes something to write with or on, their blocked mourning becomes instead a botched or partial mimesis that delivers, posthumously, after the fact, the manuscript that is said to have been, and which might still be, but which is not yet\u2014a manuscript which History, so it seems, has rejected, thrown away, and whose rejection Benjamin's readers, all of us, if we got really lucky, might be able to undo.\n\n[6] My aim in this essay is to present what I call an \"invent\/story\" of this manuscript's emergence as a lure or relay in the production of Benjaminiana or Benjamin-themed texts and objects. In what follows, I aim to discern the various lineaments that make up its figural presence as a salvific lure, a manuscript, forever rejected, but by this rejection, funding forever the possibility of its posthumous return, its acceptance, and by that acceptance, some order of recuperation or redemption that will derive a stable meaning from Benjamin's death, from your death, my death, from death itself.\n\n[7] As inventory, my essay proceeds by counting and listing variously mediatized or backed performances of this story and the way each stages these fragments or anekdota (stories and writing not intended for publication but which, nevertheless, come to light in uncanny places). My hope is to render each fragment with an eye to the specificities of its staging\u2014and so to offer what, along with Richard Burt, I have learned to call a close\/d reading, a reading content to trace the surfaces of Walter Benjamin's briefcase, to allow it to remain closed, and thereby resist the narratives of restitution and revelation that it sets in motion. An inventory seems an appropriate genre with which to present this case of reception\u2014a genre specific to the parceling out of a dead person's belongings in a probate settlement or to the experimental aesthetics of the avant garde writer, Georges Perec, who once upon a time, in 1974, kept an inventory of all the things he had \"ingurgitated\" that year. [iv]\n\n[8] As invention or storying, my essay tries also to reckon with the economy of reference at work always in reading and so to communicate the intoxicating flavor of the figural briefcase \/ manuscript \/ life figure as it winks in and out of Being. It's a quality that, like Maurice Blanchot's narrator in \"The Instant of My Death,\" I do \"not know quite how to translate.\" For the temporality of this briefcase and the manuscript it is said to contain (maybe, or still) occupies an analogous \"instant\" to that of the young man's almost death by firing squad in Blanchot's story. The narrator describes it as a \"feeling of lightness that I do not know how to translate\" (Derrida, 2000, 7-9)\u2014a moment that oscillates: \"freed from life? the infinite opening up? Neither happiness, nor unhappiness.\" \"I am alive. No you are dead\" (Derrida, 2000, 8-9).\n\n[9] Threatened all the time with its annihilation by the discovery of the manuscript that either, by its newness (Wow!) or its anti-climactic familiarity (What? That old thing again?), settles the score, the briefcase\/manuscript dyad hovers between pure figurality and a potentially catastrophic phenomenalization. By its absence, the briefcase's dimensions, its status as a device for storage, transport, and retrieval, creates the possibility, all this while, of an unknowable, unfathomable future, and with it redemption. That said, the moment of phenomenalization, coded as it is by a high stakes game of revelation, will, in the event that it occurs, pull the figure apart, returning the briefcase to the status of a mere container, and reuniting (as if come Judgment Day) the manuscript with Benjamin's corpus. The briefcase\/manuscript\/life articulation is quite \"literally\" virtual. The impression it leaves in the archive is hardly any impression at all.\n\n1. The Posthumous Impression: Walter Benjamin \/ Benjamin Walter\n\n[10] It begins then, always and again, with a briefcase, or with the mention of a briefcase and its relation to a manuscript\u2014a manuscript that will be said to be more important than a man's life. But this briefcase, as it was archived, as its material existence in the object word was recorded, did not belong to Walter Benjamin, but instead to his posthumous double, the \"Benjamin Walter\" who died, as the official record shows, at 10.00pm on September 26, 1940 in his room at the hotel, Fonda de Francia, in Port-Bou, Spain. \"Benjamin\" is a popular Catalan first name. And so, following his death, it was assumed that Dr. Walter Benjamin was, in fact, not Dr. Walter Benjamin at all, but, instead, the Christian, Dr. Benjamin Walter, whose body was buried accordingly in a Catholic graveyard.\n\n[11] On September 25, Walter Benjamin had crossed the border with a small group of refugees by an old smuggler's path, only to discover as Brodersen tells us, that \"their transit visas for Spain, which had been valid until then, had been made null and void overnight on the orders of the government, and that all...

Condoravdi\n\nDissertation Abstract:\n\nWhy can I tell you that I 'ran for five minutes' but not that I '*ran to\nthe store for five minutes'? Why can you say that there are 'five pounds\nof books' in this package if it contains several books, but not '*five\npounds of book' if it contains only one? What keeps you from using '*sixty\ndegrees of water' to tell me the temperature of the water in your pool when\nyou can use 'sixty inches of water' to tell me its height? And what goes\nwrong when I complain that '*all the ants in my kitchen are numerous'?\n\nThe constraints on these constructions involve concepts that are generally\nstudied separately: aspect, plural and mass reference, measurement, and\ndistributivity. This work provides a unified perspective on these domains,\nconnects them formally within the framework of mereological semantics, and\nuses this connection to transfer insights across unrelated bodies of\nliterature. A generalized notion of distributivity is proposed and\nformalized as a parametrized higher-order property called stratified\nreference: a predicate that holds of a certain entity or event is required\nto also hold of its parts along a certain dimension and down to a certain\ngranularity. The dimension parameter is a thematic role in the case of\n'each' and 'all', a measure function in the case of pseudopartitives, and\ntime or space in the case of 'for'-adverbials. The granularity parameter\ninvolves pure atoms in the case of 'each', pure and impure atoms in the\ncase of 'all', and very small amounts of space, time, or matter in the\ncases of pseudopartitives and 'for'-adverbials. Stratified reference is\nused to formulate a single constraint that explains each of the judgments\nabove. The constraint is exploited to improve on existing characterizations\nof distributivity, atelicity, and monotonicity of measurement.\n\nThe framework results in a new take on the minimal-parts problem that\noccurs in the study of atelic predicates and mass terms. It scales up\nsuccessfully from temporal to spatial aspect, and it explains why\npseudopartitives and other distributive constructions are sensitive to the\ndifference between intensive and extensive measure functions. It provides a\nfresh view on atomic and cover-based theories of quantificational\ndistributivity. The framework is also used to account for the scopal\nbehavior of 'all' and of 'for'-adverbials with respect to cumulative\nquantification and dependent plurals. Together with a novel theory of\ncollective predication, the framework also provides an account of the\ndifferences between such predicates as 'be numerous' and 'gather' as they\ninteract with 'all'.\n\nRead more issues|LINGUIST home page|Top of issue\n\nPage Updated: 10-Dec-2010\n\nSupported in part by the National Science Foundation \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 About LINGUIST \u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0 Contact Us \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ILIT Logo\nWhile the LINGUIST List makes every effort to ensure the linguistic relevance of sites listed on its pages, it cannot vouch for their contents.",
