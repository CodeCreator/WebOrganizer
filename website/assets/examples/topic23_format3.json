Wildlife is generally more active in mornings and early evenings than in the afternoon.\n\nSpring, summer and fall are good times to take advantage of the Refuge\u2019s excellent viewing opportunities. The months of May and June are especially prime times to see a lot of wildlife activity including young Canada goose goslings scurrying to follow their mothers.\n\nOften the best bet is to drive along the Wildlife Observation Route around the Salt Meadow Unit; there you should see a variety of waterfowl, waterbirds and shorebirds. You may hike on all refuge roads that are open to vehicle travel. Driving the roads that encircle the refuge provides broad vistas of habitat and good chances to see wildlife. Map\n\nYour car is an excellent observation and photographic blind. Staying in your car will often avoid scaring wildlife and provide you with better viewing opportunities.\n\nUse binoculars and spotting scopes to bring animals \u201ccloser\u201d to you without disturbing them.\n\nBinoculars, camera, insect repellant, bird identification books, water and a lunch will contribute to a pleasant visit.\n\nHiking is permitted on all roads open to vehicle travel. General hiking is permitted July 1 - January 20 in areas of the refuge marked on the map as seasonally open.\u00a0\nThe accessible walking trail is open March 15 - September 20.\n\nPlease respect the property rights of others. Permission should be obtained from adjacent landowners before crossing private land to enter open portions of the refuge.\n\nCross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing\nThose who choose to enjoy the refuge in this manner are welcome. Use areas and dates are the same as those for hiking.\n\nVehicles and Parking\nUse of any motorized vehicles and bicycles is permitted only on the roads and trails shown on the map in this brochure. You may park at any road\u2019s edge in a manner that does not obstruct traffic or in designated parking areas. Refuge roads may be snowed in December to mid-March.\n\nBoating for waterfowl hunting is permitted only in those areas shown as open to boating on the map in this brochure. Motorized and non-motorized boats may be used September 20 - January 15.\n\nThe Canoe Trail is open July 1 - September 20 for non-motorized boats only.\n\nPets must be leashed, except dogs used for hunting during waterfowl or upland hunts. Hunting dogs must be under the owner's control at all times.\n\nIndividuals may possess, carry and transport concealed, loaded and operable firearms on the refuge in accordance with all provisions of state and local law. Persons may only use (discharge) firearms in accordance with refuge regulations (50 CFR 27.42 and specific refuge regulations in 50 CFR Part 32). Target shooting and sighting-in weapons are not permitted.\n\nProhibited Activities\nNo camping, overnight parking, fires, fireworks or collecting objects of antiquity, including Native American artifacts.\n\nArea Services\nThe Bear Lake Valley has numerous services and accommodations available to visitors within a short driving distance.

Please contact the in Mexico City if you require further information.\n\nIf you\u2019re visiting Mexico as a tourist you don\u2019t need a visa, but you do need a tourist card, which you can get on arrival by completing an immigration form available at border crossings or on-board flights to Mexico.\n\nIf you\u2019re crossing the border into Mexico from the US (by land), there won\u2019t be an immigration officer at the port of entry, but you\u2019ll need to identify the nearest immigration office and clear your immigration status before you continue your journey into Mexico. The immigration office can usually be found close to the border area, and customs officials at the border should be able to tell you where to find it. If you fail to clear immigration at this point, it is often more complicated to do so once you have left the border area.\n\nYou need a tourist card to leave the country. If you lose your tourist card, you can get it replaced at the immigration office at any international airport in Mexico. The cost of a replacement is $295 Mexican Pesos, which is payable at a bank - the immigration office will provide you with a payment form.\n\nThere have been reports of bogus immigration officers operating within international airports. You should always refuse offers of help and head directly to the immigration office.\n\nTravelling to Mexico with minors\n\nIn Mexico, all minors travelling alone or with a third party of legal age (not parent or guardian) must demonstrate they have their parents or guardians\u2019 permission to leave Mexico. As of 27 January 2014, a Departure of Minors Form (SAM) must be completed for said\u00a0purpose.\n\nThe Mexican Immigration Institute will make\u00a0the Departure of Minors Form (SAM) available at their website It must be\u00a0filled in online and validated by the Immigration Authority at the relevant airport or point of departure.\n\nOnce completed online, the SAM form must be printed in triplicate - one for the minor, one for the airline\/transport company, and one for the Immigration Authority. The SAM form is obligatory for minors with dual nationality (one being Mexican) or for foreign minors who are temporary or permanent residents of Mexico.\n\nPhotocopies of the following must also be provided:\n\n  1. Minor\u2019s passport and birth certificate.\n  2. Parents or guardians\u2019 official IDs.\n  3. Official ID of the person travelling with the minor (if applicable).\n\nThe SAM form is valid for 6 months from the date of issue but can only be used once. If you plan multiple departures and arrivals you will need a SAM for every departure.\n\nPlease note that this regulation DOES NOT apply to visitors, or to minors travelling with one or both parents or guardians.\n\nThe Departure of Minors Form can be found at\u00a0from 27 January 2014.\n\n\nTime spent in Canada, Mexico and adjacent islands counts towards the maximum of 90 days stay in the U.S.A allowed under the U.S.A visa waiver program.\n\nNew Zealanders travelling to the U.S.A for business or pleasure may be eligible for visa-free travel under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) if certain conditions are met. These include, staying less than 90 days, travelling via a commercial carrier and with a return ticket, travelling on a machine readable passport, having an approved electronic travel authorization (ESTA), and having no criminal convictions.\n\nIf transiting the U.S.A. to a destination in Canada, Mexico or the adjacent islands, you may re-enter the U.S.A. on the return journey using any mode of transport, as long as the total visit, including\u00a0periods of time spent in transit and in Canada, Mexico or the adjacent islands, does not exceed 90 days. If the total time spent in these areas does exceed 90 days,\u00a0you would need to apply for a\u00a0B-1\/B-2 Visitor Visa, or a C-1 Transit Visa before leaving New Zealand.\n\nTo apply for the B1\/B2 or C1 visa please contact the U.S. Consulate General in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nFurther information on visas and how to apply can also be found at the U.S.A Embassy in New Zealand website:\n\nOf interest\n\nUnited Nations Handbook 2014-15\n\nUnited Nations Handbook\n\nThe UN Handbook is a comprehensive guide to the UN system and how it works.\u00a0 Read more\n\nPrime Minister's media release |\n\nNew Zealand wins Security Council seat\n\nNew Zealand has secured a place on the UN Security Council for 2015-16.
