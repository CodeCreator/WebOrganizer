Red Bull is an adaptation of the Thai energy drink Krating Daeng, which translates as \"Red Bull\". Based on market share, it is the most popular energy drink in the world. The company was founded by Thai national Chaleo Yoovidhya and Austrian national Dietrich Mateschitz. Red Bull's slogan is \"it gives you wings\" and the product is aggressively marketed through advertising, tournament sponsorship sports team ownerships (Red Bull Racing, Red Bull Salzburg, Red Bull NewYork) and celebrity endorsements. In 2009 it was discovered that RedBull Cola exported from Austria contained trace amounts of cocaine. Mateschitz adapted the product to Western tastes by diluting it, lowering the caffeine content, and adding carbonation. Red Bull essentially invented the functional energy\u00b4 beverage category in Western markets, named thus because the beverages were meant to be consumed for energy, not enjoyment purposes. Both the Thai version and Mateschitz\u2019s version of Red Bull contained the following energy-enhancing ingredients: caffeine, taurine, and glucuronolactone. These three ingredients, along with a variety of sugars and vitamins, contributed to the following properties claimed by Red Bull: Improves physical endurance, Stimulates metabolism and helps eliminates waste substances, Improves overall feeling of well-being, Improves reaction speed and concentration, Increases mental alertness. Red Bull did not define a specific demographic or psychographic segment as its target market. Rather, the company sought to reach a broad range of consumers based on their need for a stimulating drink. By not defining a narrow consumer target, Red Bull ensured that it could grow into numerous market segments. In mature markets, Red Bull achieved its highest penetration in the 14\u00b119 age range, followed by the 20\u00b129 range. On Product review, Red Bull is a sweet, caffeinated drink aimed to give consumers the high energy kick. Available only in rather expensive 250ml cans, 350ml bottles, with 4 packs and only two flavours (original or sugar-free). It contains caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, and B vitamins. Founded in 1984 by Austrian businessman Dietrich Mateschitz, Red Bull has become the world\u2019s leading energy drink, a staple in many young and active people\u2019s lives. For Competitors, big global companies such as Coca Cola and Pepsi have introduced their own energy drink versions to their product base. Mother (by Coca Cola), Amp (Pepsi), V, Battery, Red Eye and Bennu being just some in the ever-growing energy drink market. Competition also presents itself in original sports drinks, such as Gatorade (Pepsi) and Powerade (Coca Cola). Furthermore, premixed alcoholic drinks like the Smirnoff range form part of the competition. Red Bull has becoming hugely successful and operates within the global soft drink market place. Within the soft drink industry its niche is the energy drink market, of which Mateschitz was largely responsible for creating. Red Bull currently is the leading energy drink across the entire globe. It holds 70% of the market worldwide. Once the drink was passed by health ministries, Red Bull entered the Austrian market, soon thereafter then moved into Germany, United Kingdom and the USA by 1997.\n\nQuestion 1 (a)\nWhat created Red Bull\u2019s success? Where is the core franchise and benefit? Has the product\u2019s positioning changed over time?\n\nThe launch of Red Bull has been the most successful beverage launch of the last decade. It\u00b4s success is due to partnering a quality product with well-thought out original communication strategy. Which resulted in establishes Red Bull, not as fashion phenomenon, but as premium brand with continues growth. Red Bull\u00b4s real product benefits justified a premium price. It is by far the most expensive non-alcoholic drink on the market. Red Bull is 3 to 6 times more expensive than Coke.

This film was an eye opener for most people but being that I am a sixth generation farmer I understand how the seed, meat, and poultry corporations work. This film discussed the problems with the food industry today, and what we need to do to change the future of how our food is made and processed. In the first section of this documentary they talked about the food industry as a whole and how most of the food industry is ran by four or five big industries.\n\nThis should not be how it is ran as off right now and today these companies are monopolies and run unsafe facilities not for just the people that work there but how the production process is ran. This documentary also covered the meat is being produced in unsafe and unnatural way. While feeding cattle corn is a great way to make them larger quicker, it still is not the right way to feed cattle because feeding them too much corn can cause them to die because of a disease called e-coli.\n\nWhen cattle get this disease it sometimes is not caught and the cow gets slaughtered and ends up on our dinner plate and then we receive the disease by eating the meat. This needs to change cows need to be fed grass and hay, and should not be on a corn only diet. This film also covered the poultry industry and how poultry is being grown at a very fast rate and how the chicken houses are not safe or very sanitary. The poultry houses are sealed with no sunlight. Chickens in these houses are bigger and grown at a faster rate which often leads to death and disease.\n\nDon't use plagiarized sources.

During this section they discussed how farmers were getting the short end of the stick with trying to battle with Monsanto, which is the largest seed producing company in America. It is bad that farmers only have one place to go for seed for crops and after Monsanto buys all the other seed companies in America where do farmers turn when they don\u2019t have the funds to keep running. Those farmers turn to banks for loans to buy the seed from this company and hopes that it will produce. If that seed doesn\u2019t produce a good crop farmers go bankrupt.\n\nThis documentary doesn\u2019t state but shows what America\u2019s food industry is turning into and is heading to a monopoly industry. The food industry is failing as a whole and America should take it back by growing and raising our own food. We should rely less on foods that are highly processed, and put more back to farmers to make a new food industry. Without farmers America would fail. It\u2019s like my Father always says \u201cfarmers built this country, and only a farmer can rebuild it\u201d. We need to change what we are doing to our food, in the end we are only hurting ourselves by producing poor food quality.\n\nRemember.

Given the current low price of milk, a lot of producers have decided to process their milk into products with a higher added-value, including butter. However, all milks are not suitable to be transformed into butter. It would thus be useful to be able to predict milk processing properties.\n\nObjectives. The aim of this paper was to study the ability of milk to be processed into butter using infrared spectrophotometry.\n\nMethod. A normalized protocol for the production of butter was developed. Milk samples (n\u00a0=\u00a0110) collected between 2013 and 2016 were analyzed by near and medium infrared spectrometry (315 spectra). Butter samples were also analyzed by visible-near infrared spectrometry (220 spectra). Composition of the products was subsequently assessed using validated prediction equations. Principal components analyses were performed to discriminate samples.\n\nResults. Butter properties seemed to be influenced by seasons and feedings. Water content and color parameters could be predicted on the basis of butter infrared spectra.\n\nConclusions. It was possible to correlate butter characteristics with milk properties. However, it was not possible to predict butter characteristics on the basis of milk near infrared spectra. It could be interesting to try predictions from milk medium infrared spectra.\n\nKeywords : cow milk,\u00a0chemicophysical properties,\u00a0analytical chemistry,\u00a0butter,\u00a0infrared spectrophotometry\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1Milk is not always consumed as such. Indeed, milk can be transformed into various dairy products, including cheese, milk powder and butter (Holroyd, 2013). Butter is a one of the oldest dairy products worldwide (El-Hajjaji et al., 2019). Butter must be composed of at least 80% of milk fat, and of less than 16% of water (Codex Alimentarius, 2018). Conventional methods for analyzing the chemical composition of butter are slow, expensive, and require highly qualified workers (Hermida et al., 2001; Dvorak et al., 2016). Spectroscopic techniques are now widely used in the field of food control. They are often associated with chemometrics, defined by Massart et al. (1997) as a chemical discipline using mathematical and statistical methods to provide maximum chemical information by analyzing chemical data. Infrared (IR) spectrometry is widely used to predict the major components of milk and dairy products (Hermida et al., 2001; Fagan et al., 2009; Abbas et al., 2012; Baeten et al., 2014). Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopies are useful tools for quality control in the food industry (Karoui & De Baerdemaeker, 2007). Those are indeed faster than conventional methods, and require little or no sample pre-treatments (Hermida et al., 2001).\n\n2The dairy sector has faced a lot of changes since 1984, when milk quotas were established by the European Union (EU) in order to limit milk surplus. As a result, the total number of dairy farmers has dramatically decreased, falling from 47,000 in 1984 to 7,000 in 2018 in Belgium (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration belge de l\u2019Industrie laiti\u00e8re, 2019). Nevertheless, in March 2015, EU removed milk quotas. This evolution led to an increase in milk production and hence to a decrease in milk prices. In Belgium, 6,995 dairy farms are currently identified, with a milk production of around 4 billion liters per year (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration belge de l\u2019Industrie Laiti\u00e8re, 2019). An alternative for some farmers is to transform milk into dairy products with a higher added-value (Agence wallonne pour la Promotion d\u2019une Agriculture de Qualit\u00e9, 2021). This enables farmers to answer the price decrease by diversifying their sources of income and by favoring local food networks. More than 480 Walloon farmers and 260 Flemish farmers currently transform their milk into butter, yoghurts and cheeses (La Spina, 2016). For the year 2018, butter production in Belgium was 103.5 million kg, including industrial and artisanal butter (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration belge de l\u2019Industrie laiti\u00e8re, 2019). Annual data related to artisanal butter manufacture are not available.\n\n3On-farm transformation is not so easy. It requires technical qualification, as well as time and a thorough feasibility study (La Spina, 2016). It is known that milk processing depends on several factors, including animal age, lactation number and stage, season, diet composition, milk chemical composition and breed (Dal Zotto et al., 2008). In this context, it would be useful for farmers to predict when milk would not be suitable for butter manufacture. The development of easy and fast methods to analyze dairy products would also be of interest. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the processing of Walloon milk into butter, in order to identify the influence of milk properties on the processing and on the final butter characteristics using IR spectrometry techniques.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Milk samples\n\n4A total of 110 milk samples were collected from 10 farms in three Belgian provinces, namely Namur, Brabant Wallon and Hainaut, between 2013 and 2016 (Table\u00a01). The entire milk given by one cow during one milking was collected for 107 of these samples. The three remaining samples were taken from milk tank. Different breeds were considered, namely (a) Holstein (n\u00a0=\u00a089), (b) Jersey (n\u00a0= 12), (c) Holstein\u00a0x Jersey (Kiwi, n\u00a0= 6), (e) Brown Swiss (n\u00a0= 1), (f) dual purpose Belgian Blue (n\u00a0= 1) and (g) Kiwi\u00a0x Maine Anjou (n\u00a0= 1). Milk was collected separately during morning (65 samples) and evening (42 samples) milkings. Information about feedings is presented in table\u00a02. Milk was transported to the laboratory within 3\u00a0h in a 34\u00a0l plastic drum with screw lid closure (CurTec, Rijen, Netherlands) and directly transformed into butter.\n\nImage 100000000000030700000269B0FBE7EB0CD2917B.jpg\n\n2.2. Milk analyses\n\n5Before butter manufacture, each milk sample was characterized. Milk pH was measured using pH meter 340i (WTW, Weilheim, Germany) with electrode LoT406-M6-DXK-S7\/25 (Mettler Toledo, Colombus, OH, USA). Dornic acidity was analyzed in duplicate: 10\u00a0ml of milk were titrated by NaOH (0.111\u00a0M) in the presence of phenolphthalein. Dornic acidity was expressed in tenths of NaOH milliliters. The day of sampling, an aliquot of milk was mixed with 75\u00a0\u00b5L of a blend of Bronopol and methylene blue at the laboratory for further IR analyses. NIR spectra of milk were also obtained using FT-NIR spectrometer MPA (Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany). Milk samples were transferred to the Comit\u00e9 du Lait (Battice, Belgium) for MIR analyses, using MIR MilkoScan FT6000 (FOSS, Hiller\u00d8d, Denmark). Mean analysis period was seven 7. On the basis of MIR spectra, the Comit\u00e9 du Lait laboratory provided the total nitrogen content and prediction equations, developed by Soyeurt et al. (2009; 2011), were used to determine milk composition. Predicted components included: minerals (Na, Ca, P, Mg) and fat (saturated fat, SFA; mono-unsaturated fatty acids, MUFA; poly-unsaturated fatty acids, PUFA; short-chain fatty acids, SCFA; medium-chain fatty acids, MCFA; long-chain fatty acids, LCFA).\n\n2.3. Butter manufacture\n\n6Each milk sample was used to manufacture butter in duplicate, following the process described in figure\u00a01. Milk was heated to 39\u00a0\u00b0C and skimmed using cream separator Model 125 (Elecrem, Fresnes, France). Cream collected from a milk sample was divided in order to manufacture two butter batches. Creams were heated to 82\u00a0\u00b0C before being directly dipped into iced water, in order to quickly drop the temperature to 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Creams were then seeded with Flora Danica MSP (CHR Hansen, H\u00d8... (truncated)",

        "text":"The Difference Between Chinese Cusine and the Western Countres\n\nTopics: Nutrition, Culture, American Chinese cuisine Pages: 19 (7085 words) Published: April 27, 2013\n\nThis thesis explores the differences between Chinese and Western dietary culture. In the complex world culture spin, the dietary culture plays an extremely important role in the world culture. The differences between Chinese and Western culture created the differences between Chinese and Western dietary culture. Different countries have their own dietary cultural. Traditional Chinese culture is agricultural culture and land culture, while traditional western culture is animal husbandry culture and ocean culture. These two kinds of cultures reflect diverse life styles in which food is the most representative aspect. In variously cultural contexts, whether it is in concept, objects, kitchen ware, or tableware, these differences are obvious. But as development of the communication and integration of the international, Chinese and western dietary culture will be developed in common communication. This will play a significant role to promote the communication of culture in the world.\n\n\nDiet is not only the premise of social development, but also the paramount material base for human to survive with good health condition. In the early stage of barbarism, like other animals, looking for food to survive is just the instinct for human beings. But when man began to use fire to cook food and they entered the age of civilization, especially the time of cooking with the pottery, the food became the creation made by the human own wisdom and their technology. Then there is the essential difference in diet between human beings and animals that the diet has its cultural nature. Thus the history of human diet is to be this kind of history that human adapt to nature, conquer and reform nature to survive and develop in the nature, and the human dietary culture gradually comes into being in the course of this progress. As an important part of human culture, the dietary culture has a generalized meaning and a narrowed meaning. This thesis discuss the dietary culture in this narrow sense which is the total of material wealth and spirit wealth created and accumulated in the long-term progress of food consumption, and it is the knowledge about what to eat, how to eat and why to eat, including dietary object, dietary tableware and so on.\n\nChina has profound cultural heritage of dietary culture and diet play a foremost role in people\u2019s daily life so that dietary culture take a huge proportion in Chinese culture. Facing the dietary culture from other countries, we should accept or reject them based on ourselves condition. We can\u2019t only chase for enjoyment in taste, because it is harmful to our physical health if we eat too much foreign food which is belong to the high calories food. However, it is obvious that we shouldn\u2019t aimlessly reject all the new objects. Under the influence of entering the WTO and globalization, the international connection has become closer and closer so that the collision and fusion in the dietary culture always happen between Chinese and westerners. Granted, it takes a long time for two different cultures to merge and coexist and there must be an aspect that both sides can\u2019t adapt to each other. If this phenomenon occurs, we should try our best to understand, respect and tolerate another culture in right manner.\n\nA new kind of concept called Fusion Food has another name that is Global Cuisine and it has been popular in the fashionable diet circle in international cities, such as Paris, New York, London, Sydney. Now it is starting to come into China. The connotation of this Fusion Food is to merge the raw material, condiment and cooking skills together in a creative way from countries all over the world. Besides, it introduces the exoticism to the native diet by takes doctrine to discard the dross and select the essential. It is a cooking revolution flagged with fusion. Through the fusion of gourmet food, the thing it brings is not just the food, is more like the enjoyment of a variety...\nContinue Reading\n\nPlease join StudyMode to read the full document\n\nYou May Also Find These Documents Helpful\n\n  \u2022 Essay about The Differences and Reasons of Food Habit between Chinese and Western\n  \u2022 Essay about difference between Chinese and western medium\n  \u2022 The Differences Between Chinese and Western Food Essay\n  \u2022 Differences Between Chinese and Western Education Essay\n  \u2022 The Differences Between Chinese and Western Advertisement Essay\n  \u2022 On Differences Between Chinese and Western Dietary Cultures Essay\n  \u2022 Essay about Aesthetic Differences Between Chinese and Western Poetry\n  \u2022 Chinese and American Education Differences Essay\n\nBecome a StudyMode Member\n\nSign Up - It's Free",

        "text":"Toward a typology of food security in developing countries\n\nThe recent global food and financial crises have reversed the last decade\u2019s progress in reducing hunger and poverty. This paper conducts a factor and sequential typology analysis to identify groups of countries categorized according to five measures of food security\u2014consumption, production, imports, distribution, and agricultural potential\u2014by using indicators from 175 countries. The analysis first identifies five distinct food security groups, characterized by food intake, and then further splits these groups based on the various measures of food production, trade security, and agricultural potential. The results suggest that the general category of \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d is extremely heterogeneous and is not particularly useful if the focus is on issues of food security. The results also indicate that different responses are needed by different types of food-insecure countries to address the food and financial\u00a0crises.\n\nYu, Bingxin\nYou, Liangzhi\nFan, Shenggen\nPublished date:\u00a0\nInternational Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)\nSeries number:\u00a0\nPDF file:",

It is something which takes place occasionally. This may be taken to suggest that eating out in the Nordic countries is primarily a leisure activity. However, while this is an accurate portrayal of Denmark and Norway, eating out in Finland and Sweden is somewhat more common and linked to work-life. This difference probably reflects contrasting historical-institutional paths: in Finland and Sweden a food culture emphasizing cooked lunches and dedicated public policies supporting the provisioning of lunches outside the home may have promoted eating out.Multivariate analysis revealed that eating out declines with age. An urbanization effect exists, as residence in a capital city increases the propensity to eat out. There were socio-economic differences in all countries. We hypothesized that education and status would not significantly explain eating out activity after people's gastronomic interest had been controlled for. However, education was statistically significant in Sweden and Norway, and surprisingly status was negatively associated with eating out in Sweden. As expected, eating out was positively associated with income, and it was more frequent among the higher salariat and the self-employed (although not in Norway).\n\nOriginal languageEnglish\nStateAccepted\/In press - 17 Jun 2017\n\n    Research areas\n\n  \u2022 Cross-country comparison, Eating out, Nordic countries, Questionnaire study, Social stratification, Status\n\nID: 180942611",

        "text":"Food security and food self sufficiency in Bhutan\n\nNicholas Minot, Nidup Pelijor\n\nFood security is defined as \u201cthe access for all people at all times to enough food for a health, active life\u201d (FAO, 1996). In contrast, food self-sufficiency is defined as being able to meet consumption needs (particularly for staple food crops) from own production rather than by buying or importing. There is a long-standing debate on whether food self-sufficiency is a useful strategy to achieve food security. Supporters of this proposition argue that relying on the market for to meet food needs is a risky strategy because of volatility in food prices and possible interruption in supplies. The opposing view is that it is costly for a household (or country) to focus on food self-sufficiency rather than producing according to its comparative advantage and purchasing some of its food requirements from the market. This debate is reflected in the evolution of food policy in Bhutan. Early Five-Year Plans (FYPs) called for self-sufficiency in staple foods, while more recent FYPs focus on the goal of food security. This paper examines three questions related to food security and food self-sufficiency in Bhutan.",
