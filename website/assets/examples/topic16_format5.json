        "text":"New York Times Bestselling Author Kay Hooper\nPurchase Kay's Books\n\nAbout Kay\nThe World of Bishop\nFor Writers\nFAQs - For Readers\nQuestions from readers ...\n\nI often receive questions from readers, and after a time a pattern emerges, giving me a fairly good idea what sort of questions most of you have. So I hope you find this area interesting and informative. And if I don't answer your question here, be sure to write and tell me what you'd like to know so that I may include the information here in future updates.\n\nWill there be a third Thief book?\nYes \u2014 though I can't give you a firm publication date as yet. Despite my best efforts, I just had too much on my plate these last couple of years (career stuff, family stuff, building my dream house) to give Quinn the attention I feel he deserves. However, there WILL be a third Thief book, and quite likely more, since he appears to have much to say and many adventures ahead of him and Morgan. Please do keep an eye on the website, and as soon as I have firm publication dates, cover art and cover copy, the info will be posted.\n\nWill the Bishop\/Special Crimes Unit series continue?\nYes, absolutely. I'll continue to publish the series in trilogies, each set with a keyword in the title and the covers, hopefully, linked together with some visual element such as the spiderweb in the Fear trilogy, and the black-gloved hand in the Evil trilogy.\n\nAre you going to reissue more of your old (classic!) romances?\nYes. That's also being worked-out as I write this (the author seldom has complete control of such things, though I'm trying!), so please do keep an eye on the site for updates.\n\nWill you write the sequel to Summer of the Unicorn?\nIf I had to say one way or the other right now, I'd have to say no \u2014 simply because it isn't in the plans at present. However, I get many requests for other fantasy\/romance novels such as Unicorn and The Wizard of Seattle, and I would like to write more along those lines someday. So you never know. Again, please do check back, and I'll update the website as I have new information to offer.\n\nHow about the Lane Montana mysteries?\nSame there. I have no plans at present to continue that series, but I would like to revisit Lane at some point. Never say never.\n\nWill you ever include a bulletin board or blog on your site?\nNot likely. I know many authors happily blog or set up a board where their readers can post comments, but the truth is that I feel my writing time is better spent writing my books. I'll always do my best to be responsive to readers, but I've never been inclined to write in a journal even just for myself, and see no reason to turn to public journaling (blogging) now. As for a board on the site, that also can cause more problems than provide benefits, for you and for me. So I think we'll keep the site as-is for now.\n\nThough suggestions are always welcome!\n\nWhere do you get your ideas?\nThe number one most-asked question. And the most difficult to answer, because of the nature of what writers do. We use our imaginations literally every waking moment; I see or hear something, and my plot-trained conscious mind begins to spin a possible story. So the short answer is that I get my ideas everywhere \u2014 but mostly from inside my head. I read a great deal, I watch TV and movies, I talk to people. And out of that wealth of information come my ideas.\n\nWhat's your work routine?\nI don't really have one. When and how long I work is dependent on where I am in a book or project. Early on, I may spend a great deal of time thinking and musing about an idea without turning on the computer once. Writing down bits and pieces of ideas, snatches of dialogue, character descriptions. When I have begun the actual physical work of writing, the early chapters tend to go slowly as I feel my way through the story \"seeding\" plot and character points that will develop along the way. Once I've reached the halfway point in a story, the plot is firmly set, the characters \"alive\" in the sense that I now know them very well and understand why they do the things they do. The remainder of the book tends to be written much faster, and I work longer hours. It isn't uncommon in the final chapters of a book for me to work ten or twelve hour stretches for several days at a time.\n\nHow long does it take you to write a book?\nIt varies. In the old days of series romance, it wasn't unusual for me to complete a book in three or four weeks. These days, writing longer and much more complicated thrillers, it tends to take several months between the beginning of a book and its completion.\n\nDo you ever go on book tours?\nIf my publisher asks me to. Publishers vary in their beliefs and experiences as to what sells books best; my publisher tends not to send its authors out on the road very often. In all honesty, I believe my time is better spent here working. Not being an extrovert I'm afraid travel takes a great deal out of me. But there are trips from time to time, book signings and the rare speaking engagement; I will do my best to have information here at my site (in the online newsletter) whenever such a trip is planned.\n\nDo you read all the reader mail you receive?\nYou bet I do. And I answer myself \u2014 which is why I'm constantly behind and why my online mailbox is usually full. If you don't receive a reply within a reasonable time (two or three weeks, maybe), please do write again \u2014 I never mind repeated queries.\n\nQuestions from Aspiring Writers?

        "text":"FAQ: How do I get my book\u00a0published?\n\nThis is my most Frequently Asked Question by far.\n\nSo you\u2019ve written and\/or illustrated your amazing children\u2019s book. Now you want to get it published. You have two options available: traditional publishing and self-publishing \u2026 plus a third option that you should avoid.\n\nBefore we get into these options further, ask yourself what you\u2019re aiming to do with your book:\n\n  \u2022 Do you just want one copy that you can read to your kids?\n  \u2022 Or a couple of copies that you can share with family and friends?\n  \u2022 Or do you\u00a0think your story really has legs, and\u00a0could\u00a0sell\u00a0competitively in\u00a0bookstores?\n\nIf you just want\u00a0one or a couple of copies for personal use, then definitely self-publish \u2013 but go with a website like Blurb. You upload your content, they print copies and post them back to you, and you keep copyright. Easy, done, sorted.\n\nIf you truly believe that your work is of a publishable standard, then I recommend going for traditional mainstream publishing through a publishing company, or if you have the stamina for it, go for self-publishing.\n\nI\u2019ll explain these two options below, plus a third option that you need to avoid.\n\nOption 1: traditional, mainstream publishing\n\nThis is where a publishing company helps you to edit their work, organises printing, marketing and distribution, and pays you an advance and royalties.\n\nThere are two main pathways to mainstream publication.\n\nPlease note that these two pathways are not mutually exclusive, and can be happening at the same time.\n\nPathway A: The Slush Pile\n\nYou send your work to several publishers. Your manuscript is added to the \u2018slush pile\u2019, a collection of every unread manuscript sent by you and everyone else hoping to be published by that company. Don\u2019t be discouraged though; publishers do go through their slush piles bit by bit, and people do actually get their manuscripts discovered this way. Because of the slush pile though it can take many months for a publisher to respond to your submission query (and these days a number of publishers are saying, \u2018if you don\u2019t hear back from us in x number of months, assume that your submission was not accepted\u2019).\n\nSO You wait for responses. You get rejected many times. You keep writing\/illustrating in the meantime, still practicing your craft. Then hopefully, eventually, your work is good enough to be published, and a publisher notices your work and offers to publish it.\n\nPathway B: Professional organisations\n\n2: You join an organisation like the Society of Children\u2019s Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI) and\/or the Australian Society of Authors (ASA). You go to events where you get to meet editors and publishers and you book some critique sessions. You get face-to-face feedback, and advice for how to improve your work. You go away and practice some more. Then hopefully, eventually, your work is good enough to be published, and a publisher notices your work and offers to publish it.\n\nThe place of illustrators in mainstream publishing\n\nNote that:\n\n  \u2022 usually, the publisher picks the illustrator.\n  \u2022 most of the time the writer and the illustrator DO NOT collaborate before submitting to a publisher.\n\nI explain the reasons for this in another post called \u2018How do I find an illustrator for my book?\u2019\n\nIf you want to be a children\u2019s book writer, you absolutely must know how the illustrator\u2019s role intertwines with yours. So please do read this post plus the points about illustrators in the next section.\n\nSending submissions to publishers\n\nBefore you send anything to any publisher, visit your local bookshop and have a look at the children\u2019s book section. Make a stack of books that seem like the ones you would like to make. See who publishes them, then check out the publishers\u2019 websites and see if they accept submissions. Note what you would need to submit, and stick to the submission guidelines. Some want hard copies, some only accept digital copies. Some only accept submissions on certain days of the week, and some at certain times of the year. Do your homework and follow the guidelines on each publisher\u2019s website.\n\nIf you\u2019re a writer only, then generally you\u2019ll be asked to send a copy of your manuscript in a certain format, maybe with a cover letter.\n\nIf you\u2019re an illustrator only, then generally you\u2019ll be asked to send a sample or samples of your best work, again with a cover letter.\n\nIf you\u2019re a writer AND an illustrator, then generally you\u2019ll be asked to submit a copy of the manuscript, plus a black and white storyboard and\/or a dummy book, plus two or three samples of what the finished artwork might look like.\n\nIf you\u2019re a writer and you\u2019ve already collaborated with an illustrator:\nthis is not generally how mainstream publishing works. Sometimes you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019ve written a manuscript and you asked your partner\/sibling\/aunty\/friend\/neighbour\/random acquaintance to do some illustrations \u2013 now you\u2019re going to submit all your work together. That\u2019s great. However. This puts you in an unusual position. You may find that a publisher loves the words of the story but not the illustrations.\u00a0OR they love the illustrations but not the words.\u00a0OR\u00a0 they may see potential in both the words and the illustrations, but they think the words need to be edited and the plot needs to be changed a bit, in which case the illustrations might also need to change. So if you\u2019ve collaborated with an illustrator before submitting to a publisher, be prepared for these possibilities.\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t complete final illustrations for an entire book before submitting to a publisher. That\u2019s a lot of work to put in, and the publisher might want you to change everything.\n\nCopyright, Advances and Royalties\n\nin traditional publishing arrangements, illustrators retain copyright over their illustrations, and writers retain copyright over their text. They share royalties from the books: 5% of RRP each (the rest goes to booksellers, distributors, printers and publishers). Royalty statements are sent every 6 months; payments are sent at this time as well, providing you\u2019ve made some sales.\n\nThe writer and illustrator also receive an advance payment when they sign the publishing contract \u2013 this is an advance of expected royalties. So if the advance is $1000, then you have to sell enough books to earn that advance back before you can get any more royalties. If you don\u2019t sell enough books to earn the advance back, you still get to keep the full advance. The publishers assume all financial risk and responsibility in this model; they take care of printing, marketing and distribution.\n\nFor advice on publishing contracts, buy the book \u2018Australian Book Contracts\u2018 from the Australian Society of Authors. Also, check out their model publishing agreement template; it\u2019s free for ASA members or $11 for non-members. The ASA also offers a contract assessment service for ASA members or state writers\u2019 centre members.\n\nFor advice on the legal and business issues related to writing, buy the book \u2018Between The Lines\u2018 from the Australian Society of Authors.\n\nFor more information on traditional publishing:\n\nRead the Australian Society of Authors\u2019 advice on how to get published.\n\nCheck out this post I wrote called 6 books to help you make better picture books.\n\nOption 2: self-publishing\n\nSelf-publishing is a whole other ball game. You literally take on the role of the traditional publisher, which means you get complete control over the project but also the entire financial risk. You need to organise your own design and printing, plus your own marketing and distribution to bookstores (online and\/or bricks-and-mortar).\n\nI know of only a few successful children\u2019s book writers and illustrators who self-publish; they all do it full time and approach it like a business, so it\u2019s possible for them to make a decent living from it. They are exceptions to the rule.\n\nThe main services out there for self-publishing are Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), which allows you to create ebooks for Amazon Kindle readers; Amazon Createspace, which is a print-on-demand service; or Ingram Spark, which allows you to make both e-books and print-on-demand books. I\u2019ve never used these myself, but my self-publishing colleagues do; it\u2019s up to you to excerise due diligence and do your research before entering into any commercial agreements with these websites.\n\nThe role of illustrators in self-publishing\n\nYou and the illustrator need to work out whether you want to share the financial risk or whether the illustrator wants to be paid up front.\n\nI cover this in more detail in another post called \u2018How do I find an illustrator for my book?\u2019\n\nIf you\u2019re considering self-publishing your writing and enlisting an illustrator, please do read that post before you get started down that road.\n\nFor more info on self-publishing:\n\nCheck out the Australian Society of Authors\u2019 free advice on self-publishing.\n\nThe ASA also has a paper available called Introduction to Digital Self-Publishing; it\u2019s free for ASA members or $11 for non-members.\n\nAlso check out WritingWA\u2019s free resources for self-publishers.\n\nJoin the facebook group For Love or Money, a support group for independent authors. You can ask questions and find advice. It was set up by author S.K. Quinn, and her book The Indie Author\u2019s Survival Guide is a must-read for anyone heading down the self-publishing road.\n\nOption 3 (which is not an option): vanity publishing\n\nOption 3 is where a company tries to look like a mainstream traditional publisher but is really a glorified and very expensive self-publishing service. In our industry it\u2019s called \u2018vanity publishing\u2019.\n\nVanity publishers are the ones that offer to help you publish your book for a fee \u2013 usually a VERY LARGE and UPFRONT fee. They may want to retain copyright. They may not show you a contract until after you\u2019ve paid. Vanity publishers make their money off the exorbitant fees they charge you and not off the book sales; thus they have little to no interest in marketing ... (truncated)",

        "text":"Characteristics of Postmodernism\n\nQUESTION: What are the characteristics of Postmodernism?\n\n\nWhen listing the chracteristics of postmodernism, it is important to remember that postmodernists do not place their philosophy in a defined box or category. Their beliefs and practices are personal rather than being identifiable with a particular establishment or special interest group. The following principles appear elemental to postmodernists:\n  \u2022 There is no absolute truth - Postmodernists believe that the notion of truth is a contrived illusion, misused by people and special interest groups to gain power over others.\n\n  \u2022 Truth and error are synonymous - Facts, postmodernists claim, are too limiting to determine anything. Changing erratically, what is fact today can be false tomorrow.\n\n  \u2022 Self-conceptualization and rationalization - Traditional logic and objectivity are spurned by postmodernists. Preferring to rely on opinions rather than embrace facts, postmodernist spurn the scientific method.\n\n  \u2022 Traditional authority is false and corrupt - Postmodernists speak out against the constraints of religious morals and secular authority. They wage intellectual revolution to voice their concerns about traditional establishment.\n\n  \u2022 Ownership - They claim that collective ownership would most fairly administrate goods and services.\n\n  \u2022 Disillusionment with modernism - Postmodernists rue the unfulfilled promises of science, technology, government, and religion.\n\n  \u2022 Morality is personal - Believing ethics to be relative, postmodernists subject morality to personal opinion. They define morality as each person\u2019s private code of ethics without the need to follow traditional values and rules.\n\n  \u2022 Globalization \u2013 Many postmodernists claim that national boundaries are a hindrance to human communication. Nationalism, they believe, causes wars. Therefore, postmodernists often propose internationalism and uniting separate countries.\n\n  \u2022 All religions are valid - Valuing inclusive faiths, postmodernists gravitate towards New Age religion. They denounce the exclusive claims of Jesus Christ as being the only way to God.\n\n  \u2022 Liberal ethics - Postmodernists defend the cause of feminists and homosexuals.\n\n  \u2022 Pro-environmentalism - Defending \u201cMother Earth,\u201d postmodernists blame Western society for its destruction.\nPostmodernism - Learn More!",
