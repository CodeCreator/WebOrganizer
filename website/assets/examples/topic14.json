        "text":"3 Interior Design Tips Anyone Can Use\n\nWant to make your home look nicer but don't know where to start? Use these three tips to make your Fort Lauderdale, FL home look like it was treated by a professional.\n\n  \u2022 Don't skimp on color. Fear of color makes many home decorators choose a pallet of neutral colors that don't leave much to draw the eye. Include a few spots of bright color throughout your room for a more pulled-together look.\n\n  \u2022 Show who you are. Don't feel that your decor has to look like something out of a magazine. Be true to yourself and your family for a uniquely attractive aesthetic that is pretty as well as useful.\n\n  \u2022 Switch it up frequently. Don't get bored with your decor! Every few months, spend some time rearranging furniture and accessories for a fresh look.\n\n\nLuxe Home Staging and Design, Inc offer interior design services for homes and businesses in the Fort Lauderdale, FL area.

Pin it Submit to reddit add to Wists\n\u00ab on: January 26, 2014 12:55:49 PM \u00bb\n\nAeons & aeons ago I made a stick vase\/lantern. It still makes me smile Smiley when I look at it. But it's all on its own one side of the landing whilst the other side looks bare Sad.\n\nI don't have sufficient prunings to make another similar one, so I had to think of something else. Undecided\n\nWell, I use a lot of string in the garden, maybe one of those string vase things would be appropriate. So I tried it. Wink Easy enough to do, especially because I chose a very straight sided jar.\n\nIt's nice, but doesn't feel finished yet. It needs some ornamentation, but I haven't decided what yet. Maybe something to bring outside in?\n\nLook twice, buy once.
