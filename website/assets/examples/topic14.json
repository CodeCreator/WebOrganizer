        "text":"Jump to content\n\nSIAI Marchetti, Planet Models, 1\/72\n\nRecommended Posts\n\nAfter holding\u00a0off the request to build a model for a friend for a long time, he still persuaded me, not only for one, but for 2. Both are Marchetti's\u00a0in 1\/72 and 1\/48. This is the construction of the 1\/72 version.\n\nThe SIAI-Marchetti SF.260 is an Italian\u00a0light aircraft, used for performing aerobatics and as a military trainer. The aircraft was designed by Stelio Frati for the Aviamilano company in 1963-'64, and the first prototype flew\u00a0 July 15y as the F.260. Before it entered production the design was sold to SIAI Marchetti.\n\n\nIn 1969 the Belgian airforce bought 32 aircraft which were located at Goetsenhoven Airbase and after closure of the base were relocated to Beauvechain airbase. The aircraft was used as a trainer and for the stuntteam the red devils.\n\n\nThe kit is from Planet Models:\n\n\nand the layout he wants\n\n\nThe kit only has a few parts:\n\n\n\nBiggest disadvantage is the hull being cast solid... which makes it very, very tailheavy...\n\n\nso I started by cutting the hull in two and drilled out (regular drill, I know, a Dremel would be more handy for this...) as far as I dared\n\n\n\n\nthe extra hole was an accident... superglue and sprue will solve this\n\nThe other side was also hollowed out:\n\n\n\nstill lokking pretty thick, but it is only 1mm in reality.\n\nNext up I rejoined the hull parts sanded these smooth and added the rudder and elevators. Then I drilled some holes in the nose to add some fishing lead. One large horizontal hole and a few vertical ones.\u00a0\u00a0Allas ... still not enough it seems, close, but not completely...\n\n\n\nnext session is closing up the rear bulkhead and the interior\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, just a longshot, camo colors are olive green and stone, but it seems some aircraft have a third color. Could it be complete vietnam camo on this bird? Other qiestion are about the interior. Were these early versions, before the overhaul and lightgrey interior equiped with a complete black interior and instrument panel? Not a lot of info and pictures are available from those days, and pictures show mostly the interior after the upgrade (complete lightgrey interior), and sometimes completely black or black with a lightgrey instrument panel... questions, still a lot of questions...\n\n\n  \u2022 Like 2\nLink to post\nShare on other sites\n\nI\u2019m watching this very closely, as I\u2019ve done three dogfighting sessions\u00a0in one of Air Combat USA\u2019s\u00a0SF260s\u00a0and have this kit in my stash, planning on building it to match the aircraft I flew.\n\n- Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Like 2\nLink to post\nShare on other sites\n\nA bit of progress:\n\nThe backseat was completely smooth, so I used a scriber to add some detail\n\n\n\nNext I've cut up some paper to make the backwall. To make it some more solid, I've drenched it with thin CA. Next it was sanded smooth and painted. There's no PE in this kit, so I've made the seatbelts from prepainted paper.\n\n\n\nThe 1\/48 has some bars on the frontseat for the passengers. Made these from some copperwire\n\n\n\n\nAnd all mounted into the interior:\n\n\n\n\nand just a complete overview to give a comparison of\u00a0the size and the lead jigsaw:\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Like 3\nLink to post\nShare on other sites\nOn 8\/1\/2020 at 3:07 PM, Silenoz said:\n\nBy the way, just a longshot, camo colors are olive green and stone, but it seems some aircraft have a third color. Could it be complete vietnam camo on this bird?\n\nI could be mistaken, but the same colour scheme as used on the F-104s?\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Thanks 1\nLink to post\nShare on other sites\n\nCreate an account or sign in to comment\n\nYou need to be a member in order to leave a comment\n\nCreate an account\n\nSign up for a new account in our community.

        "text":"Usually the pocket square needs very little attending to. But just like everything else, your Creative Corgis pocket square might need some tender love and care from time to time.\n\nFor a quick and effective refreshing, steam it and let it cool on a flat surface. You can also iron it with the lowest temperature on the iron and a thin towel between for extra security. Try to avoid ironing on the edges. Since they have hand-rolled hems and stitched by hand they might crease and fold when ironed directly on top with a lot of pressure. Again, once ironed, leave it to cool down for a few minutes. All fabrics are more prone to creases when warm and humid.\n\nTo get a stain on a favourite piece of clothing is always a bummer, but the key to successful removal is time! Tend to your stain as soon as possible since the longer it sits, the harder it will be to remove.\n\nWhen looking dapper, one often adds a little perfume. A good tip is to put on your perfume before putting on your clothes and placing your square since the scent might stain on sensitive fabrics such as silk.\u00a0\n\nWine stains are sometimes inevitable, but not hopeless to remove! First action is to dab a little carbonated water on the stain. Make sure not to be too rough, so hydrate on a towel and gently pat your stained square with it.\n\nAfter a long week at the office or a late night of dancing, the best spa for both you and your pocket square is airing outdoors for a while.\n\nTry to avoid handling your square with greasy fingers. If due to a few cocktails and a late night greasy snack, this is unmanageable and you end up with stains, do not fret! Baby wipes or makeup remover wipes can get you a long way in dissolving the grease.\n\nGot chewing gum on your pocket square? Simply put your pocket square in the freezer and gently break off the chewing gum once it has stiffened. But please, if this happens to you, send us an e-mail and tell us your back story. It surely most be tremendous!\n\nIf you end up with stains you have no idea where they came from, put on a brave face and go to your trusted dry cleaner. It does not hurt if you flip a coin in a fountain on your way there. And if not even they can remove it, embrace it and consider it a part of life and a sign of good times. Fun and exciting days are sometimes a bit messy.\n\nFollow us for news!",

Benjamin Moore\u2019s vibrant Cool Aqua pairs well with headboard, in a Link Textiles fabric, along with pops of crisp white. to finish the look, Mindel settled on custom bedding by E. Braun & Co., Oluce lamps from MSK Illuminations, and Design Within Reach nightstands.\nI love this product! I purchased it, because we have a really tall wall on our staircase. That wall has been very empty and needing something to make it look more inviting. I ordered this product on July 14, and received it July 28. I was impressed immediately by the thickness of the decal it does not look like a sticker, but more like a carving that has been placed on the wall. Secondly the shine and smoothness of the pieces is amazing quality, and gives a nice look to the overall appearance. It should be noted that the decal is several hundred pieces, but it comes with a template to and numbered pieces to show you where to pace them. I did however go a little rogue and made my own design after I made the initial tree. The decal is made to create more of a square look ... full review\nOk, we saved the best for last.

A few fell off the wall so I cut an additional piece from the pad of tape that came with it for added security and they have stayed put. Otherwise, you can further secure with the mainstream 3m wall adhesive, etc.\nThere's a certain ethereal feel to attics because of the unique architectural lines.
