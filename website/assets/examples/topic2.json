Here if the user changes some thing in the template and publish it, then everything will be changed in all the site because everything is shared among the sites but i don't want that. I have to change only one template in one of the site and second site shouldn't be changed. How can i achieve this. \u00a0 \u00a0\n  2.

Please also note to properly select the widget you would like to apply the template to by selecting it from the\u00a0This template is applied to... dropdown list.\n\n    Please refer to the following documentation article for more details on creating new widget templates.\n\n    Sabrie Nedzhip\n    Do you want to have your say in the Sitefinity development roadmap?

This will probably involve running a command such as this:\n$ . ~legion\/setup.sh\n$ source ~legion\/setup.csh\nThe exact syntax will depend on what kind of shell you are using and where your Legion files are installed (i.e., the value of ~legion will depend on your individual Legion net). Consult your system administrator for more information.\n\nAbout object permissions\nIf your system administrator has enabled Legion security, the objects that you create while logged in cannot be used by any other users. If you wish to share your objects you will need to give other users permission to read, write, or execute objects.\n\nFor our purposes, \"read\" methods are defined as methods that obtain but do not modify an object's state, \"write\" methods are methods that modify an object's state, and \"execute\" methods are methods that run an object.\n\nThis command works on common Legion object types: context, file, class, tty, implementation, host, and vault objects all fall into this category.\n\nChanging object permissions\nYou can use the legion_change_permissions command to give other users permission to read, write, or execute your objects. There are specific lags to add [+] or remove [-] read, write, or execute permissions on objects. So, if you wanted to allow user bob to be able to read your file object foo, you would enter:\n$ legion_change_permissions +r \/users\/bob foo\nThis lets bob \"read\" your object foo.\n\nOther relevant on-line documents:\nClick on the to go to the page.\nLogging in to a running Legion system\nLegion graphical user interface\nIntroduction to Legion context space\nContext-related commands\nHow to start remote programs in Legion\nSample makefile for remote programs\nAdapting a parameter space study for Legion\nObject permissions\nLegion tty objects\nRunning a PVM code in Legion\nRunning a Legion MPI code\nRunning native MPI code\nQuick list of all Legion commands (1.6.4)\nUsage of all Legion commands (1.6.4)\nStarting a new Legion system\nUsing Legion security features\nLegion host and vault objects\nAdding host and vault objects\nBrief descriptions of all on-line 1.6 tutorials\n\nLast modified: Fri Jun 4 14:37:26 1999\n\n[an error occurred while processing this directive]",

The P3P WG is working on P3P 1.1, a generalization of 1.0, to random XML vocabularies.\n\n<dbooth> Hugo: They released first WG in Feb. We wrote a team submission that shows how a generic P3P attribute can be attached to an element in WSDL and what it would mean.\n\n<dbooth> Hugo: The first part shows abstractly what it would mean to attach a privacy policy to a WSDL 2.0 component. The second way shows two concrete ways to do it.\n\n<dbooth> Hugo: More recently I saw email from Glen about Features and Properties that seems to indicate that F&P is more restrictive.\n\nPhilippe: this is an experimentation at this point\n\nJonathan: so the output would be a list of issues again the spec\n\n<asir> http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TeamSubmission\/2004\/SUBM-p3p-wsdl-20040213\/\n\nJonathan: volunteers?\n\n<dbooth> Hugo: (Answering \"Why are there 2 ways to do this?\") To illustrate that it could be done in two ways, and illustrate the differences between them.\n\nTom: it seems that you have found that the use of attributes is more flexible than the use of features and properties\n\n<sanjiva> +1 to using this example to learning about F&P vs. extensions ..\n\n<Scribe> ACTION: Hugo to look at the Handling Privacy in WSDL 2.0 for issues against our spec\n\nJonathan: people are encouraged to read and review this informally\n\nReview of the XML Schema PER\n\nJonathan: Volunteers?\n\nwe have 3 weeks to do this\n\nPaul: I am interested in having a look\n\nAsir: I haven't seen anything which would be a problem to us\n\n<Scribe> ACTION: Paul to review the XML Schema PER\n\nTask force status\n\nJonathan: I have seen some emails by the Media type description\n\ntask force\n\nUmit: I am almost done converting the document\n\nthe plan is to publish as is, and then modify Anish is now officially the co-editor on the XMLP WG side\n\nJonathan: XMLP has more constraints than we do on this\n\nthey should be driving the timing the Schema versioning task force still needs some work on the charter to be started\n\nNew Issues.
