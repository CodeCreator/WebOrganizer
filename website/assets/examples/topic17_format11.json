        "text":"2020 Presidential Race Front Page Opinions\n\nDemocrats Preparing For Civil War 2020\n\nRemember 2016? It wasn\u2019t so long ago as the media cycle makes it seem. Remember all the candidates in the Republican party? 17 candidates.\n\n2020 is coming soon and, according to CNN, there are already 17 Democrat candidates,not counting Joe Biden or Howard Schultz (currently running as an Independent candidate, having left the Democrat party).\n\nThe top five candidates are former Vice President Joe Biden, Independent Senator and 2016 candidate Bernie Sanders, former US Representative in Texas Beto O\u2019Rourke, US Senator from California Kamala Harris, and US Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren. Although there are lots of candidates, there are mainly three types of Democrat voters. Those groups of voters are the moderate \u201cBlue-dog\u201d democrats, the progressives, and the intersectionals. One of these groups does not seem like the others: the moderates.\n\nSanders, Beto, Harris, and Warren all fit within the progressive sector of the Democrat party, although maybe Harris doesn\u2019t really count because she doesn\u2019t identify as one \u2013 but still hasn\u2019t pissed them off.\n\nIn the intersectionality group, they have Kamala Harris, who perfectly fits in, and then the other top five candidates (except Joe Biden) try to fit in by talking about racial injustice, changing their name to sound more hispanic , or identifying as part Native American .\n\nIn the Progressive Bracket, Bernie is obviously at the the top because he\u2019s the most famous \u201cdemocratic\u201d socialist running in 2020. Then, there\u2019s Beto in a distant second for identifying as a capitalist,\u00a0even though his policies are similar to Bernie\u2019s. In third place, comes the former champion of progressivism, Elizabeth Warren (she lost first place during 2016 after endorsing Hillary Clinton). In last place, is Kamala Harris because the media talks about her mainly as the Attorney General of California to give her the false image of being \u201chard on crime\u201d \u2013\u00a0which satisfies Republicans who take the media\u2019s word for granted.\n\nIn the Intersectional ranking, Harris is first because she is a member of two \u201coppressed\u201d groups. She\u2019s a woman and an African-American. Beto comes in second for changing his name to sound more Hispanic. Then comes Warren, who lost a lot of support by accidentally proving that she\u2019s barely part Native American. In last place is Bernie Sanders because he didn\u2019t call President Donald Trump a racist until he decided to run in 2020.\n\nIn the end, those two rankings don\u2019t really matter because, in a democracy, the voters that count the most are the moderates. Whoever wins those, wins the swing states. And whoever wins the swing states, wins the election.\n\nBut who is representing the moderates? Or who will be able to grab their vote if Biden decides not to run? Or if Biden decides to appeal to the more progressive and intersectional voter, who will get the moderate vote? And can any candidate that appeals to the moderates satisfy the progressives and intersectionals?\n\nThese are the biggest questions because the fact is that, in order to win against President Donald Trump, they need to swing their party back to recapture some of the states they lost in 2016,\u00a0such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Florida. And they can only do that by reaching out to the moderates.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 best hope was the CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz \u2013 but he\u2019s planning to run as an independent. He will act as a spoiler vote for the Democrats, as reported in CNN. In 2020, the Democrats\u2019 biggest obstacle will be meeting all of their voters demands and satisfying all groups, especially the moderates.\n\nIf the Democrats are not able to satisfy all of their groups, like the situation in 2016 ( 1\/10 Bernie supporters voted for Trump, 1\/10 voted for another candidate that isn\u2019t Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, and 1\/20 didn\u2019t vote), then it is very likely that the Democrats will fail in 2020.\n\nRelated posts\n\n; })();",

        "text":"Radical Feminism: The Kiss of Death\n\nFebruary 11, 2007\n\nRadical Feminism: The Kiss of Death\n\nMasha West\n\nDaughters and granddaughters of the women who started the sexual revolution of the 60s have tossed aside what remained of sexual taboos. Gloria Steinam must be tickled pink. Just check out what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on with the younger generation and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get the picture. Only the picture is not a pretty one.\n\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great strides\u00e2\u20ac\u009d made by the feminist movement have been lost on young celebrities. Britney Spears has been spotted frequenting nightspots with actress Lindsay Lohan and heiress Paris Hilton. Spears made headlines when the paparazzi photographed her pantyless, climbing out of a car. Now Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being blasted for making anti-gay and racist remarks. Twenty-year old Lohan checked herself into a rehab facility for drug and alcohol abuse. Is it any wonder that Spears and Hilton were voted the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst celebrity role models?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nFeminists are furious at the fearsome threesome.\n\n\"A great promise was contained in the moment when Madonna kissed Britney at the MTV Awards,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d crowed feminist Camille Paglia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She in a sense was saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI'm passing the torch to you.' It was a fabulous moment. Britney looked toned, in control of her career and it was up to her to take the next step. Literally, from that kiss, from that moment onward, Britney has spiraled out of control. It's like Madonna gave her the kiss of death!\"\n\nRadical feminism, not Madonna, has given women the kiss of death.\n\nAs a result of the feminist movement there are no gender-based role differences in many marriages. Wives wear the pants in the family, husbands show little or no leadership and are often wimps, and children are unmanageable. Is this what God intended for the family?\n\nNo. The Bible teaches that the husband is to lead, provide for, and protect his family. The wife is to help her husband by managing the household and taking care of the children. Children are to be raised with discipline and love. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way.\n\nToday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s children are train wreck. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re undisciplined, disrespectful and, frankly, as lazy as a Sunday morning. Sadly, this is the rule not the exception.\n\nObviously something has gone terribly awry. Distinctions in masculine and feminine roles, ordained by God as part of the created order, have been blurred. Men have become un-masculine, thus unattractive to women; women have become un-feminine, thus unattractive to men. Granted, some women have a feminine appearance. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let that fool you. In the blink of an eye, females spew obscenities that would make a bull rider blush.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every generation of teenagers has its way of out-shocking and out-sexing the previous group of young people, and in that sense teens who own the middle- and high-school hallways today are no different. But for the most marked changes in this generation, turn your eye toward the girls.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d [1]\n\nWhich brings me to the latest trend among teenage girls. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not talking about body piercing, tattoos or electric pink and green hair fashions. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m talkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 street fights. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m talkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knock down drag out hair pulling fisticuffs caught on cell phones and distributed on the Internet. (Watching girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exchange body blows is not recommended for the feint of heart.) Standers by, both male and female, fervently root for their favorite girl to win. Most self-respecting females would find it humiliating to have their bruised and battered faces plastered all over the Internet. Oh contraire! Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s girls think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cool to kick butt. (Note: American wrestling TV network, WWE, is the second most searched for item on Yahoo!.) Win or lose, many girls enjoy the spotlight, even when they look the fool. Miss USA recently experienced a barrage of media coverage, not to identify her accomplishments, but to expose the beauty queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drug use, underage drinking and sexual misconduct. Tara Conner checked into rehab to save face \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to retain her tarnished crown.\n\nRadical feminists are wringing their hands over Tara.\n\nAnother trend among the younger generation is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freaking.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d At student dances all across America (including middle schools) kids are dirty dancing. Teens are simulating sex to the beat of the music, usually with, but not limited to, a partner. Young people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creative minds have come up with expressions like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dog dancing,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lap dancing,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d doing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the grind,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the nasty,\" and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the wax.\" I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain. Use your imagination.\n\nThis sort of tawdry teenage conduct spooks some administrators. The principal of Manuel High School, Beverly Keepers, witnessed teens doing the nasty and had the good sense to turn up the lights. Soon chaperones were moving through the crowd, separating couples. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nothing seemed to calm them down,\" Keepers said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It's difficult when you have 800 students to tap every one on the shoulder when they're dancing inappropriately.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Tapping 800 students on the shoulder would be exhausting! But the chaperones pressed on. Keepers complained that they saw it everywhere on the dance floor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looked like they were having sex, only with their clothes on, and sometimes the clothes were pretty revealing. To me, a public school should not allow that to happen.\" [2]\n\nTo me, the principal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction is surprising in light of the fact that a component of the secular progressive (SP) agenda for government schools is to teach sex education in kindergarten. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right. Sex Ed beginning in kindergarten. Liberals also plan to introduce students to sexual orientation and transgenderism in grades 8 and 10 (or younger if they can get away with it). SP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approve of youngsters learning about sex at the tender age of 5, yet they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re mortified when teens simulate sex acts in high school gymnasiums on prom night?\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trivialization of human sexuality is a perversion,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Pope Benedict the XVI in a recent speech. The pope called upon the media, parents, Catholic parishes and schools to work to expose children to what is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aesthetically and morally excellent\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and to help them acquire \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skills of discernment.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe feminist movement has certainly done its fair share to corrupt the younger generation. Hollywood is partly responsible for the decadent behavior of our youth. Liberal educators also play a role. But the bulk of the blame goes to parents for not doing their part to protect their children from indecency. One of a parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary responsibilities is to instill moral values. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mom and Dad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job to teach their kids right from wrong. Which begs the question, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why do so many parents trust liberals to educate their kids?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nChildren are on loan from God. He commands Mom and Dad to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Train a child in the way he should go,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153when he is old he will not turn from it\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (Prov. 22:6). Parents have dropped the proverbial ball and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rolling downhill at a rapid clip. Case in point. Homosexuality is being wrapped in a pretty package and presented to youngsters as same-sex couples \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loving\u00e2\u20ac\u009d each other. Parents sit idly by while SP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work their wiles to persuade vulnerable children that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153men loving men\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153women loving women\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is normal and natural. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not. Same-sex sex goes against nature. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sexual perversion.\n\nAt this point in time liberals are winning the culture war. In an interview with Rachel Davis, 13-year-old Kalli Kearney from Darnell-Cookman Middle School said nonchalantly, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Girls make out with girls. They have boyfriends, but they make out with girls.\" [3]\n\nSadly, girls making out with girls has become commonplace. Hooking up with someone for sex is also commonplace. According to Deborah Tolman, director of the Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I listen to girls talking . . . what I still hear is that girls want relationships, but they've taken that wish underground. The options available to girls have become \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchooking up' and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfriends with benefits\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 [friendships that are more than platonic].\"\n\nNo doubt sexual freedom is a dream come true for radical feminists. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nightmare for loving, sensible parents. Adolescents are having sex with no strings. They believe they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using each other in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good way.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Unwanted pregnancy and acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, some of which they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll live with for the rest of their lives, is not so good. But hey, they can cross that bridge when they come to it. In the meantime, youngsters should live, love, laugh, and be happy!\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d1Samuel 15:23\n\n\n[1] No more inhibitions By Rachel Davis, The Times-Union http:\/\/www.jacksonville.com\/tu-online\/stories\/012107\/lif_5979367.shtml\n\n[2] Dirty moves? \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFreaking' at school dances doesn't sit well with educators By Larry Muhammad http:\/\/www.courier-journal.com\/apps\/pbcs.dll\/article?AID=\/20070129\/FEATURES\/701290327\n\n[3] Ibid http:\/\/www.jacksonville.com\/tu-online\/stories\/012107\/lif_5979367.shtml\n\nCopyright 2007 by Marsha West.

        "text":"Saturday, October 15, 2005\n\nPreaching w\/ A Vengeance\n\nPreaching With a Vengeance\nPat Robertson's Fierce Rhetoric May Have Diminished His Political Clout\n\nBy Lynne Duke\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nSaturday, October 15, 2005; C01\n\nWhat do Hugo Chavez and Harriet Miers have in common?\n\nPat Robertson: The rhetorical hit man who opined several weeks ago that Chavez, the Venezuelan president, should be assassinated now has thrown down the gauntlet for senators who oppose Miers's nomination for the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Now they're going to turn against a Christian who is a conservative picked by a conservative president and they're going to vote against her for confirmation?\" he said Thursday on \"The 700 Club,\" his voice sarcastic with disbelief. \"Not on your sweet life, if they want to stay in office.\"\n\nIt's becoming almost routine, this strident talk. Indeed, Robertson, 75, has a long history of controversial statements, dating at least to his infamous 1991 conspiracist tract, \"The New World Order.\" And he shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nThis week, he accused Chavez of sending money to Osama bin Laden, making nice with the jailed terrorist \"Carlos the Jackal\" and negotiating with Iran for nuclear materials. And after Katrina, Rita and the spate of global earthquakes and floods, he's raised the biblical end-of-the-world scenario. Or could it be, he's also offered, that it is God's wrath against abortion?\n\nSometimes it's hard to keep up with this man who once equated feminism with witchcraft, who said of the State Department: \"You've got to blow that thing up.\"\n\nSo just who listens to Robertson (other than Chavez and the news media), and does he matter in politics? Depending on whom you talk to, Robertson is an embarrassment to the conservative movement who has yet to realize his own irrelevance, or he is a valuable Christian leader of millions, a man still capable of marshaling votes and influencing politics.\n\nAll of that can be debated. But we know this: He is founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, where his show, \"The 700 Club,\" beams his brand of populist, charismatic Christian evangelism to a daily audience of 1 million from his base in Virginia Beach.\n\n\"He's not oblivious to the fact that people in Washington will take note when he says something, especially something outlandish, but his primary audience is his listeners,\" says Richard Cizik, a senior official with the National Association of Evangelicals.\n\nAnd yet Jerry Falwell, chancellor of Liberty University and founder of the Moral Majority, says it is Robertson's political nature that drives the strident, pointed talk.\n\n\"Pat ran for president once and he's a very political person, and that is the way politicians talk,\" says Falwell, who describes himself as Robertson's friend. \"They all use intimidation and political strong-arming to hopefully pick up a vote or two.\"\n\nThough Robertson's not running for anything, says Falwell, \"Pat is one of the most political people I know.\"\n\nRobertson declined to be interviewed for this article. It is unclear what impact he will have on the Miers nomination.\n\nA Senate Republican source burst out laughing when told of Robertson's threat on the Miers nomination. \"I don't know anybody on the Hill who's going to quake in their boots when Pat Robertson issues some sort of a threat or a decree,\" said the source, who requested anonymity to protect his boss.\n\nRobertson's clout stems from his founding in 1989 of the Christian Coalition, which succeeded in inserting the power of evangelicalism into the political arena -- a force shaping the nation's politics to this day, as the Miers battle shows. And Robertson's 1988 run for the White House, though it failed, painted him as the go-to leader on Christian conservatism.\n\nBut the Christian Coalition today is a shadow of its former self politically. And some analysts say Robertson's credibility has suffered, in part, from his rhetoric.\n\nIt is notable, though, that the American Center for Law and Justice, another institution Robertson founded, is headed by Jay Sekulow, one of the White House's advisers on judicial nominations. Sekulow says he is not a Robertson conduit to the Oval Office.\n\n\"Pat Robertson's an influential conservative leader,\" says Sekulow. \"He's quite capable of picking up the phone himself.\"\n\nA poll conducted for the Public Broadcasting Service last year found that half of white evangelicals viewed Robertson favorably, while James Dobson of Focus on the Family, another Christian conservative group, received favorable ratings from 75 percent.\n\nRobertson, in his \"700 Club\" statement Thursday, listed some of the conservative leaders supporting Miers. In addition to himself, they were Dobson, Falwell, Sekulow and Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. Dobson declined to comment on Robertson.\n\nLand, who said he is on friendly terms with Robertson, said he did not agree with Robertson's tactic of \"making threats to senators\" and called Robertson's comments suggesting Chavez should be assassinated \"inappropriate,\" \"foolish\" and \"counterproductive.\"\n\nIn August on \"The 700 Club,\" Robertson said of Chavez: \"We have the ability to take him out, and I think the time has come that we exercise that ability. We don't need another 200-billion-dollar war to get rid of one strong-arm dictator. It's a whole lot easier to have some of the covert operatives do the job and then get it over with.\" Robertson later apologized.\n\nLast month, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Robertson said, \"We have killed over 40 million unborn babies in America.\" Then he mused about American society being \"unable somehow to defend ourselves against some of the attacks that are coming against us, either by terrorists or now by natural disaster? Could they be connected in some way?\"\n\nRobertson's style is that of the demagogue, some critics say, who profits from the sense of marginalization felt by many conservative Christians -- the us-vs.-them mentality that courses through the evangelical Christian movement.\n\n\"If you watch his program on a regular basis, you find that he has created a kind of alternative world view that he presents to his viewers,\" says Robert Boston of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Boston is no fan of Robertson, it should be noted. He wrote the 1996 book \"The Most Dangerous Man in America? Pat Robertson and the Rise of the Christian Coalition.\"\n\nBoston describes the Robertson worldview this way: \"The rest of society mocks evangelical Christianity, doesn't understand God's plan, is un-Christian. . . . Public school systems are out to corrupt your children, that Christians are persecuted like Nazis.\"\n\nAs Robertson's strange public statements have mounted in recent years, his political clout has diminished, and even fellow Christian leaders have tired of defending or explaining him, some observers say.\n\n\"Whether there are a lot of moms in Alabama or Kansas or Missouri who watch Pat [on television] every day while ironing, his own influence among the larger religious conservative movement has been on the wane for some time and is largely torpedoing,\" says Michael Cromartie, director of the Evangelicals and Civic Life Project at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.\n\n\"On the conservative side politically, everybody's avoiding this guy and trying to figure out how not to make him mad and, at the same time, not make him an ally,\" he said.\n\nThere are so many contradictions to Robertson. He is a Christian who advocates killing.\n\nHe opposes gambling and yet was involved in professional horse racing. (He disbanded his racing stable, including a horse named \"Mr. Pat,\" amid criticism in 2002 of his racing interest.)\n\nHe was a credible presidential candidate in 1988, even besting a sitting president (George H.W. Bush) in an Iowa caucus.\n\nA mere three years later, he showed himself far outside the mainstream when he penned \"The New World Order,\" which alleged a web of historic connections involving the Illuminati, Free Masons, Rothschilds, Warburgs, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations and Satan, master of them all down through the ages.\n\nSome commentators said the book carried a heavy dose of anti-Semitism, since the venal money men in it tended to be Jews. But in the years since \"The New World Order\" was published, Robertson's staunch advocacy for Israel (which he and other Christians justify because they believe Israel is key to the return of Jesus Christ) has won him high marks from some conservative Jewish commentators.\n\n\"The guy is going to Israel and speaking up for Israel and shaking hands with Jews,\" says William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard. \"The 'lived reality' is, yeah, he has some wacky views. On the other hand, he's not seeking to put them to any effect.\"\n\nKristol says he's more troubled by a different Robertson contradiction: He is a religious leader who has been an apologist for an impressive list of dictators: Rios Montt of Guatemala, Mobutu Sese Seko of the former Zaire, Charles Taylor of Liberia. (He even did business with the latter two, attempting diamond and gold mining deals in Zaire and Liberia, respectively.)\n\n\"That's different from having some oddball views,\" says Kristol. \"For me, that puts Robertson in a bad category.\"\n\nOver the years, Robertson explained his advocacy for dictators in terms of the Cold War: Mobutu and Montt, he would say, were anti-Communist. And Taylor, he would say of the Liberian leader in more recent times, was a Christian leader facing the surge of Islam in Africa. Never mind that Taylor was associated with rebels who routinely amputated civilians' hands; never mind that he would be indicted as a war criminal. Robertson's involvement with Zaire and Liberia ran counter to U.S. State Department policies.\n\nHerman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1989 to 1993, says Robertson's dealings with Mobutu were viewed in Foggy ...

        "text":"\n\nRepublicans spooked by Cantor's defeat\n\nJun 23, 2014 - By Mark Shields\n\nLet's be perfectly blunt. Ever since House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his Virginia primary to the underfunded Dave Brat, we political pundits (yes, I'm a card-carrying member) have been publicly embarrassing ourselves.\n\nWithin hours of the polls closing, commentators and analysts, none of whom had predicted Cantor's even being in trouble, were arrogantly telling the world exactly why long-shot Brat won -- and what his victory meant for Congress, the country and the Republican Party.\n\nSorry, but as somebody -- it was either Winston Churchill or Ozzy Osbourne -- wisely noted, the winners get to write history.\n\nThat, in this case, would be Brat, who campaigned as an unwavering opponent of comprehensive immigration reform, calling it \"the most symbolic issue that captures the difference between myself and Eric Cantor in this race, but it also captures the fissure between Main Street and Wall Street.\"\n\nHe argued that Wall Street and \"the Chamber of Commerce\" both \"want cheap labor, and that's going to lower wages for everybody else.\"\n\nFor House Republicans, for the foreseeable future, immigration reform legislation has become their third rail of American politics -- a place of danger to be carefully avoided as potentially fatal to their own political survival.\n\nNobody can explain House Republicans better than Tom Davis, a former eight-term congressman from Virginia as well as past chairman of the campaign committee responsible for electing Republicans to the House.\n\nAsked by Audie Cornish on NPR if tea party House Republicans were now confident that they were winning, Davis was candid.\n\n\"Well, they are in many ways, and having seen Cantor defeated sends chills down the spine of members when it comes to taking a vote on compromising or working with the president, because you can topple the majority leader -- who is seen as the most conservative member of the Republican leadership, and he is not conservative enough. What does that mean for me?\"\n\nImmigration reform is officially dead, killed by House Republicans.\n\nThe Democrats, with a president whose negative sixth-year job rating closer to that of the unpopular George W. Bush than to the soaring numbers earned by Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, don't have a historical precedent to give them any realistic confidence about winning a third consecutive White House term in 2016.\n\nBut the GOP now appears determined to snatch defeat from the jaws of potential victory by further alienating Latino voters, Asian voters and all voters who, for example, believe that we, Americans, don't punish children for the \"sins\" of their parents.\n\nThis value was well-expressed some 13 years ago by the governor of the first state to pass, by a vote of 142-1 in the state House and by 27-3 in the state Senate, a law to permit academically qualified high school graduates who were in the country illegally to pay in-state tuition at state universities.\n\nHere is what that governor said then: \"We must say to every child learning in (our) classrooms, 'we don't care where you came from, but where you are going, and we are going to do everything we can to help you get there.'\n\n\"And that vision must include the children of undocumented workers.\"\n\nThose were the words of the governor of the first state in the nation to pass its own Dream Act, Republican Rick Perry of Texas. The year was 2001.\n\nThree years later, Bush would win 44 percent of the Latino vote against John Kerry.\n\nFor a Republican Party that cannot even speak the words \"undocumented workers,\" sadly, that past is not a prologue.\n\n\nEditor's note: Syndicated columnist Mark Shields is a former Marine who appears regularly on \"Newshour\" on PBS.\n\nGet your copy of The Ranger online, every day!

        "text":"Threat to Indian democracy and modernity\n\nMay 26, 2012, 11:56 pm IST in The Mainstream Maverick | India | TOI\n\nSmall incidents make up the big picture, so goes an old Chinese proverb. Several seemingly inconsequential recent occurrences and quotations in India highlight a worrisome trend: that of a backlash against Indian modernity.\n\nDominated by economic reforms and neo-liberal ideas, the past twenty years should have led India towards a path of tolerance and openness. But the opposite seems to have happened. A whole range of discomfiting reality checks, belittle daily, the work done by Indian modernists. Recently, a controversy over old cartoons depicting Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru and Dr. BR Ambedkar\u2014two genuine modernists India ever produced\u2014in text books taught at the college level\u2014erupted with great acrimony. Despite the fact that these cartoons were part of text books for some years now, the Government of India thought it fit to remove the same. Two prominent Indian social scientists resigned from the National Board that prepares college level prospectus.\n\nNotably, this topic did not hit the roof in the 1970s or the generally illiberal 1980s. It came forth in 2012 when India has a more active media, a new generation of modern youth impatient with the ways of their fathers and mothers and better awareness about the rights of women, minorities and individuals.\n\nThe contemporary reaction against modern,\u00a0 liberal values can be seen in various fields. A Mumbai High Court judge asks a married woman seeking divorce on grounds of domestic violence to go back to her husband and behave like Sita. The problem here is not just the callous injustice inherent in the judge\u2019s stance. Worrisome is the stolid conservatism entrenched in an organ of the Indian state and the recourse to ancient symbols to resolve a current contradiction. \u00a0\n\nA similar conundrum exists in the statement of a Saharanpur DIG (now transferred)\u2014in Uttar Pradesh\u2014that he would have killed his sister had she eloped with a man of her choosing. Here again, the issue is not whether there are certain officers with a feudal mind-set in the Indian\u00a0 system. Several mobile carrying, Audi driving, youths in jeans and t-shirts in and around Delhi and other Indian metropolis also talk casually of marking the forehead of their sisters with a bloody bindi (dot)\u2014in effect shooting them straight in cold blood\u2014if they dare choose to marry outside caste.\n\nHonour killings have risen sharply in the last twenty years. In the kinder, gentler, Gandhian India of yore, people perhaps were far more traditional. But dissent was tolerated. Violence against women was not condoned openly. The situation in new economy areas like Gurgaon or Surat or Mangalore or Pune or Kolkata or Bengalaru or Chennai is so bad that one shudders to think of what will happen to several freedoms won by Indians after severe struggles against patriarchy, brahminism and feudalism.\n\nA grimmer picture emerges from the reactions of a significant section of Patels of Gujarat to the conviction of members of their community in the 2002 Gujarat riots cases. Instead of remorse and guilt at the murder of muslim women and children, the perpetrators have expressed a siege mentality and a subtle justification of their acts. A major Gujarati Patel leader has even gone far to express the community\u2019s\u00a0 linkage with Vallabbhai Patel, as if India\u2019s first home minister\u2014known for upholding the Indian constitution and respecting\u00a0 liberal values\u2014would have pardoned barbaric acts.\n\nThe question here again, is the total absence of the concept of individual responsibility. Incidentally, Gujarati Patels have a skewed male-female ratio\u2014allegedly, female infanticide is practiced widely. A case for connect between their participation in communal riots and their resistance to modernity can be made. \u00a0\n\nYet, as a community, Gujarati Patels do not have caste councils. They are known for their upwardly mobile and often flexible, quasi-progressive principles. Something terrible must have happened to their ethos and their state.\n\nSocial attitudes impact the polity in various subtle ways. Germany, Italy and other smaller European nations that went over to fascism in the 1930s exhibited first, intolerant socio-cultural values. In Germany, Hitler\u2019s rise was preceded by a strong reaction against modernist trends in art and culture. Feminism, sexual freedom, gay and lesbian currents were condemned as alien to German culture. Experimentation in German drama and cinema\u2014that went on to create history in the US and Hollywood after the migration of several dramatists and filmmakers like Bertolt Brecht and Fritz Lang in the Nazi era\u2014was sought to be banned. Nazis saw these experiments as representing `modernist decadence\u2019.\n\nFearing Nazi persecution, Walter Benjamin, one of the foremost literary critic and chronicler of German modernism, committed suicide. Besides artistes, hundreds of thousands of student and women activists were silenced. In Spain, fascists shot and killed Lorca, one of the greatest modernist poets and dramatist in the history of Spanish letters. The grouse against Lorca was not just that he was part of the anti-fascist popular front during the Spanish civil war. The poet was targeted because he represented individual liberty and championed modernist experiments in personal and political life.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIn India, the MF Hussein incident brought to light, weaknesses of Indian liberalism. Hussein\u2019s experiments in art celebrated fun, sensuality, the power of symbols and the historical code of the Indian nude. The way he was denounced and hunted out of the country recalled Germany of the 1930s. Nazis too once deprecated the German nude.\n\nIs India moving towards some form of fascism then? In Indian society, the emergence of a Hitler type leader\u2014who condemns individuality as a foreign phenomenon and urges all to unite behind an authoritarian, pseudo-nationalist idea\u2014cannot be discounted. The Indian tragedy lies in the fact that naked fascism is capable of creeping in under the cover of parliamentary democracy. Already, the support of corporate,\u00a0 pro-rich\u2014and right wing liberal forces\u2014to a rabid, fascist chief minister of a certain state\u2014blamed widely for complicity in the 2002 anti-Muslim riots\u2014lays bare the discomfiting reality.\n\nHitler too was supported by right wing liberals of Europe and the German big corporate forces. He first got elected through the ballot\u2014then he used bullets to kill democracy, dissent, modernity and Parliamentary institutions. As the countdown to 2014 elections begins India\u2019s D day with fascism might not be far. At stake is not just Indian democracy but modernity as well. \u00a0\n\nFaced with the possibility of a fascist takeover, Europe in the 1930s gave birth to various resistance movements and anti-fascist political initiatives. Chief amongst these was the formation of a Popular Peoples front\u2014a rainbow coalition of anarchists, socialists, communists, liberals, centrists and other anti-fascist forces. Fascism in countries like France was averted because of the formation of a Popular Front in the mid 1930s. A popular front government in Spain gave right wing fascists the fight of their lives. Fascism triumphed in Spain only because of external help provided by Germany and Italy to Spanish fascists.\n\nIn Germany, the failure of anti-fascist forces to forge a Popular Front was the chief reason behind Hitler\u2019s triumph. In India, we cannot afford to make this mistake. The formation of a Popular Peoples Front\u2014that encompasses Maoists, civil-human-Dalit-minority rights activists, Left-of-Centre politicians, Communists, Socialists, Centrists and all anti-fascist forces\u2014is the need of the hour, in time for the 2014 elections. In this, two trends need to play a major role: Left-of-Centre figures inside the Congress and radical Left-democratic forces who explore a wide range of political options extending from participation in electoral politics to struggles on the streets. No popular front can survive in India without defending parliamentary democracy. Progressive forces inside the system constitute an essential part of this programme.\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, such a project has to have striking power on the Indian street to combat fascist hordes.\n\nDISCLAIMER : Views expressed above are the author's own.\n\nFrom around the web\n\n    More from The Times of India\n\n      Recommended By Colombia\n      Comments on this post are closed now",

        "text":"Tuesday, November 14, 2017\n\nDon't Mix Politics and Climate Science\n\nBy Agnieszka I. P\u0142onka\u00a0\n\nThe widely understood libertarian environment has lately published a multitude of very eloquent articles about how to approach the global warming issue, what to think about \"established science,\"\u00a0and whether or not to be \"agnostic.\"\u00a0Those materials, however well\u00a0written, fail to see the core of the scientific method \u2014\u00a0which is again understandable since their authors have been immersed in a different kind of science \u2014 that is,\nsocial science. The word \"agnostic\"\u00a0does not fit in here, however. One can be an \"agnostic\"\u00a0only towards what is untestable. But we can test the temperature in which water freezes, we can test how poisons affect human body, and we can test how certain layers of the atmosphere affect solar radiation. Those results are necessarily verified by nature itself. They leave no place for even the subtlest \"polishing\"\u00a0of the results so that they fit the assumption \u2014\u00a0and if what climatologists say seem to leave a different impression, it is either due to the imperfections of human language or due to the fact that, sadly, they already tend to incorporate political agendas into their scientific commentaries.\u00a0Let us note here however, that the carbon isotope 12C is way too primitive a structure to be plotting for worldwide socialism. (The ratio between 12C and 13C in the atmosphere serves as a geochemical argument for anthropogenic global warming).\nUnfortunately, since global warming serves the government as justification for their\u00a0plans for greater control of society, we are doomed to mix politics and science where it should never be mixed. This may be one of the symptoms of the declining level of public discussion. Again unfortunately, the reaction in which we rebel against our preconceived ideas is perfectly natural. Here it is linked, however, with the difficulty of distinguishing between scientific information and political beliefs. The question \"what is going on?\"\u00a0is different than \"what should be done?\"\u00a0If I provide a geochemical argument for manmade global warming, it does not automatically mean that I am an interventionist. After all, a\u00a0lot of basic research underlying modern atmospheric physics is as old as 200 years \u2014\u00a0but the physics is not accused of bias, since\u00a0back then\u00a0no government was plotting to use it as a pretext for public policy.\u00a0\nThe magnitude of emotions linked with this issue is unsurprising given that it may affect all humanity in a relatively short time. I do have an impression though that those emotions stem from the fact that the whole discussion is politicized, not because of a genuine care for\u00a0human life.\n\nA Classical Case of\u00a0\"What Is Seen and What Is Unseen\"\n\nThe\u00a0laissez faire\u00a0position in environmental problems suffer from a serious and rather impossible to deal with image defect \u2014\u00a0it does not give easy answers and well calculated recipes. A statist will provide a detailed and nuanced answer with a graph, an emmission-reduction calculation, and a firm loud prescription for government intervention. The non-interventionist will not. We will say that we trust to the same innovation that has continually improved human living standards for centuries.\u00a0That we trust that the human mind can break through a number of Mathusian traps is born from historical experience, and experience suggests\u00a0we can \u2014\u00a0with accordingly big investments \u2014\u00a0create the technology level we need to adapt. In contrast, no such experience speaks to any success for global schemes of controlling the global economy.\nIn this light, interventionism is not only unethical, but also inefficient. In a public discussion this stance would loose, since we can only repeat after Hayek that we do not know what to do - and it is impossible for any individual to know:\nIt is through the mutually adjusted efforts of many people that more knowledge is utilized than any one individual possesses or than it is possible to synthesize intellectually; and it is through such utilization of dispersed knowledge that achievements are made possible, greater than any single mind can foresee. It is be\u00adcause freedom means the renunciation of direct control of individual efforts that a free society can make use of so much more knowledge than the mind of the wisest ruler could comprehend.\nFor an average listener of such a debate, it would be a choice between \"I don't know\"\u00a0and \"I calculated all, I know what the government should do, and I even have a photo of a sad seal to invoke your feelings.\"\u00a0It's no\u00a0wonder that freedom loses the advertising battle.\nAnd yet, what sounds unconvincing in front of a TV, works much\u00a0better in real life. What we need is technological progress in the energy sector and in the methods of waste storage and reduction. Would that progress be possible in a rich or in a poor country? How to cook up new technologies most efficiently, and then make them widely affordable and accessible?\nThat is why the answer to what the desirable role of the government with respect to global warming should be is the stuff of yet\u00a0another\u00a0classic\u00a0Bastiat's essay. I am certain that the control of carbon dioxide emissions would be the last chapter of \"That what is seen and that what is not seen,\" had he lived in our times to witness it.\nObviously, it is straightforward to calculate the expected temperature change given certain restrictions. It will be beneficial for the environment \u2014\u00a0short-term,\u00a0that is what is seen. But how those restrictions would affect the prices of strategic resources, transportation, and, generally speaking, life? Wouldn't they hamper long-term investments in advanced research and development, that is \u2014\u00a0the only long-term solution to the problem? What if, to give an example, a company that studies cheap nuclear power plants that also extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere goes bankrupt? What if a number of other similar initiatives do?\n\nWill You Say \"Yes\" to Civilization?\n\nPoor societies cannot afford to care about the environment. They cannot afford research and development. The government wants people to believe it is the only means of addressing ecological problems.\u00a0\u00a0But the state\u00a0can be counted on to just use any new powers as a\u00a0means of control, and in the long run \u2014\u00a0to impoverish societies and block the progress of civilization. We are being told we must\u00a0choose between the freedom of humans and the freedom of polar bears, convincing us that they trade-off with each other, while actually it may not be the case at all. (Here I omit the discussion whether polar bear protection should be subject to law or to ethics).\nStatists here think in a very close-minded way \u2014\u00a0failing to see how dynamic our civilization is. Not long ago, we could not imagine having the internet or commercial flights. How are we so certain then, that in the next fifty years we wouldn't come up with a clean, cheap and efficient way of obtaining solar energy, or a routine and\u00a0inexpensive procedure of reducing carbon dioxide particles to carbon and oxygen? The assumption that this will not happen, and if it will, it will by state coercion, only makes this progress slower. And going deeper into this assumption would eventually lead to creation of a totalitarian monster which controls not only our energy use, but also birth rates or meat consumption. How immoral and terrifying would be the reduction of a human being under such inhumane conditions! And how could we escape a Malthusian trap while being trapped by the state?\nAnd if someone, anyone claims that \"capitalism destroys the Earth,\" show them any pollution or ecological-catastrophes map. They speak for themselves.\nAgnieszka Izabela P\u0142onka is currently completing her doctoral degree in geophysics at Utrecht University, collaborating closely with ETH Zurich. She holds a Master degree in geophysics from the University of Warsaw, and BSc in theoretical physics from the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. She is a Mises University almunus.\n\nThe above originally appeared at Mises.org.\n\n1 comment:\n\n  1. This article seems to be based in the assumptions that global warming and increases in atmospheric C02 is bad. Considering that the current temperatures and atmospheric C02 levels are toward the low end of historical levels, there is good reason to argue the latter.",

        "text":"The disaster of Haiti is well represented in Canadian media, with significant coverage in print and on television. MacLean\u2019s magazine\u2019s recent cover article photo is one of the very few that perhaps accidentally represents what is really happening in the news, in comparison to its usual sensational headlines. Unfortunately the article itself, while it covers the basics of the disaster and the feeble aid missions, misrepresents the country of Haiti and the historical background and context that is part of the overall disaster that is Haiti. [1] This is similar to most Canadian media.\n\nSimply put the MacLean\u2019s article is long on observational anecdotes, accompanied by brief out of context snippets of the political\/cultural\/economic situation within the country prior to the earthquake. The suggestions at the end on how to treat Haiti looking to the future are all too readily quotable without having much substance, and within that again, deny the significance of its history and how it could move forward from the here and now.\n\nMedia description\n\nNot until the fifth page of the article and after many anecdotes do the authors describe Haiti as \u201cRacked by poverty and insurrection at the best of times,\u201d and now including the \u201cutter absence of governmental authority.\u201d No attempt is made to qualify the poverty and where and how it originated and the nature of \u201cinsurrection\u201d is also never qualified.\n\nBefore the quake, the country suffered \u201cintense poverty, poor construction standards, a lack of infrastructure, and social chaos\u201d, a country with a \u201cchequered existence, with leader after leader killed in office.\u201d The previous U.S. occupation (1915-34) ended with Haiti \u201cthrown into a vortex of uprisings, instability and dictatorship that conspired to keep it the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere.\u201d Wow, it is all their own fault!\n\nThe article never asks why, yet the implication is that it is the Haitians\u2019 own fault, that they are simply that way and have been so since \u201c124 years after the beginning of the slave revolt.\u201d Does no one ask why Haiti is so poor and full of disruption? The apparent truth, in my mind, is the original racism that the people of Haiti revolted against so many years ago. The republic has never escaped the yoke of the white man and the western world\u2019s determination (and some of the local elite beholden to them) to keep Haiti an impoverished, subservient nation.\n\nHistory as it should be told.\n\nHaiti began its present journey as a plantation slave state. After its successful revolt against its French overlords, the government struggled to succeed against the continuing imperial ambitions of Great Britain, France, Span and the U.S. The French demanded reparations of 150 million francs, a demand supported by a larger slave state, the U.S., fearful of its own slaves trying to establish something similar. Haiti suffered under this forced indebtedness \u2013 it is difficult to imagine a successful revolution being forced to pay for itself \u2013 up until 1946.\n\nThis debt has compounded many times over the decades. The U.S. invaded and occupied the country in 1915, an era in which U.S. corporations exploited the people and the land for their own benefit, arguably benefiting the country because it improved the infrastructure, yet leaving it millions more in debt. The MacLean\u2019s article identifies the \u201cbloody and corrupt\u201d rule of the Duvaliers, including the \u201ckelptocracy\u201d of \u201cBaby Doc.\u201d Yes the Duvaliers stole millions of dollars, and their support came from among others, the U.S., as they were Latin American stalwarts in the anti-communist hysteria of the times and as usual, increased the debt of the country significantly.\n\nCurrent events\n\nHaiti\u2019s \u2018modern\u2019 history undergoes the same tale of financial ruin by western institutions. Once in debt, the IMF and World Bank stepped in and as is usual with their actions, demanded trade concessions and internal financial changes that not only increased the indebtedness of the country, but forced the diminution of its social infrastructure, and forced many independent farmers off their lands and into slave wage jobs in the urban centres. Formerly an exporter of rice, Haiti was forced into a position wherein it had to import cheaper subsidised U.S. rice. None of this is mentioned in MacLean\u2019s.\n\nMacLean\u2019s mentions \u201cthe succession of governments and instability that followed the Duvaliers,\u201d but failed to mention the most important point pertaining to democracy and independence and chances of success, the elections of Jean-Bertrand Aristede. Aristede again had to weather the depredations of foreign interference, again significantly led by the U.S. as his cause was that of a popular and socialist government, a scary idea to the Washington consensus.\n\nFor western media in general, this wilful ignorance of Haitian history is detrimental to the earthquake relief. It is detrimental because if the citizens of the western countries better understood the history, they could very well demand that the Haitian debt be forgiven, and perhaps even reversed. It is detrimental because it dismisses the comprehension in general as to why the country is so poor, a question asked but never properly answered in the media. And finally it is detrimental because without understanding the background, the future of the country can only be more thoroughly muddied and muddled.\n\n\nThere is no one overall solution or fix, but there are some significant areas where it can start. MacLean\u2019s offers some platitudes and limpid arguments about what can be done, but never really succeeds with its discussion. The discussion does go into territory of protectorate, under the aegis of the UN or the U.S. or both. The truth is finally hit in a simple statement by Roger Noriega, \u201cI think it\u2019s a shortcut to say we have to put it under international trusteeship. I think Haitians should be given the opportunity to run their own affairs. We need to accompany them in that process.\u201d [2]\n\nWhat a novel idea! Haitians running their own affairs! Obviously there are some difficulties with getting the country somewhat operative again, but with the U.S.\u2019s new occupation force already in place, controlling flights, controlling the distribution of goods, ever fearful of popular \u201cinsurrection\u201d against the U.S. backed elites, corporations, and rules and regulations of the IMF, it will obviously be difficult if not impossible to do.\n\nYes, get out of Haiti, let the popular committees set up their own government, hopefully in ever widening circles of popular democratic support. Then cancel all debt owed by the country \u2013 no one appears to be willing to step forward to do this yet. Allow fair trade, establish tariffs to help Haiti regain its fragile agricultural production and home grown businesses and industry without suffering the depredations of the IMF and the international corporations that prey on all weak countries.\n\nWill it be easy? No\u2026but then given a chance with unfettered aid, one never knows. Messy? Probably, no country has ever been rebuilt without difficulty and troubles, but usually only over the short term if outside interference is gone and outside support (being more than money to the elites and industries, but rather to help the social infrastructure of education, healthcare, environmental protection, and workers rights). Brutal? That possibility exists, but is most likely if the U.S. and other western countries vie to continue their dominance over the former slave colony.\n\nSo it comes back to racism, fear of socialism, fear of losing a nation that would much rather go in a different direction than the imperial nations of today and yesterday would wish. I support all the relief efforts that are currently underway (minus the U.S. occupation forces) and wish the best for the country. That best can only be achieved if its current status is understood in the context of its conflicted past. This is the only slave nation, a nation of blacks, that ever freed itself from white domination. It is time to step up and help the country establish the freedom it deserves without the underlying fear of a free black nation that seems to have underlain most of its historical relations with other powers.\n\n\n[1] Michael Petrou et al. \u201cHorror in Haiti.\u201d MacLean\u2019s.

However, for the average person, such scandals are not all that surprising and are almost something to be expected because they are but a reflection of the darker side of Taiwan\u2019s political and economic culture.\n\nThere is a popular Chinese saying that, \u201cIf you have guanxi (\u95dc\u4fc2, connections) you will be okay, but if you don\u2019t, then you have problems.\u201d Having guanxi and using it to your advantage to get around normal avenues for doing things is part of everyday life in Chinese societies around the world \u2014 and Taiwan is no exception.\n\nI live in Hualien and often have to book a train ticket to Taipei and back. Each time I need a ticket, I have to get up early to book tickets online the morning of the trip and even this does not work every time. However, there are always quite a few people that always manage to get a ticket anytime they want by making one simple phone call. When people are employing such methods to obtain a train ticket, is it any wonder they do the same thing when it comes to industries involving tens of billions of New Taiwan dollars?\n\nTo put it simply, when there is something to be gained, people will use their guanxi to get it. Supply and demand are what make guanxi possible. Those in business are fond of money and politicians have power. Taiwan\u2019s guanxi culture is created when these two spheres mix and interests and benefits are exchanged.\n\nTherefore, nobody was really surprised when Lin was accused of corruption, and they most probably think that this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to corruption involving government officials and businesses.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that elections are hugely expensive affairs. It is often said that it takes millions to get elected to a city or county council and tens of millions to get elected to the legislature. Stories of people who spend hundreds of billions on elections also abound. If that is what it takes to get elected, then who on earth can afford it, unless they are backed by massive family wealth? As a result, politicians often look to wealthy businesspeople for support. After they get elected, they are naturally happy to speak up for their business interests. Alternatively, they can use the power vested in them as public representatives to apply pressure or solicit bribes to cover their election costs.\n\nLin was elected as a legislator four times and after losing in the Kaohsiung County commissioner elections in 2005 and in the legislative elections this year, one can imagine he must have needed quite a bit of funding.\n\nThe whole Lin incident can be explained as a product of a culture that has developed for a long time between political and business circles, and it is therefore unsurprising. However, this is also what makes it scary and dangerous.\n\nTaiwan has often been criticized as being one of the world\u2019s ugliest and dirtiest nations \u2014 a key reason being Taiwanese are used to how things are and the government ignores things like illegally parked cars and hawker stands set up where they are not allowed to. If everyone is used to these connections between government and business, then this country is well beyond help. Given its domestic situation, how can Taiwan even begin to talk about boosting its international competitiveness or about catching up with Singapore or South Korea?\n\nThis story has been viewed 2993 times.\nTOP top",
