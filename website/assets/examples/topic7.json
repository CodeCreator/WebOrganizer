While he expects us to keep these commandments perfectly, \u00a0He knows we can\u2019t so He sent his son Jesus to die on the cross for us. \u00a0This is the foundation for teaching my kids right from wrong.\n\nA while ago I wrote a post on lying. \u00a0Why do they lie?\u00a0 Why do our kids do the things they do? \u00a0We have many issues with Isaiah. \u00a0As I started this post, I had pause to do a time out with him for stealing his brother\u2019s blue tooth. \u00a0And his chocolate Easter Bunny front he freezer. \u00a0And for food under his bed. \u00a0(it is bed room cleaning day!) \u00a0 Isaiah is five, he entered our family at 3 months. \u00a0So he has been raised by us, same morals and values. \u00a0Same rules. \u00a0I keep teaching him right from wrong.\n\nOne of our foster boys I made up a little reminder sheet for him. \u00a0He had sticky pockets. \u00a0AKA as always taking things with him that were not his. \u00a0He did this a lot from his class room. \u00a0He would take things from other kids backpacks. \u00a0He could walk by something and just take it.\n\nThe reminder sheet simple said:\n\nIs it yours? \u00a0Yes, then you may have it. \u00a0No, leave it be.\n\nI think one of the best ways to teach kids right from wrong is to discuss it daily. \u00a0Talk about why what they did was wrong, not that it was just wrong. \u00a0Keep the communication open. \u00a0Discuss the 10 commandment. \u00a0Martin Luther\u2019s Catechism is great to review the 10 commandments and their meanings. \u00a0There are many great ways to memorize the 10 commandments.\n\n\u00a0teaching kids right from wrongHaving Family Rules also help. \u00a0This gives them guide lines to so they know what is right and what is wrong. \u00a0 We have rules, but they have become unwritten down again. \u00a0Again a May project we are working on to update them. \u00a0 \u00a0I think rules should not be should nots.\n\nYou should not hit. \u00a0Instead say,\n\nIn this family\/house we respect each other. \u00a0Which means we do not hit, kick, bite, smack, pull hair, spit, punch or hurt any one. \u00a0Including the pets.\n\nThis way is also better for new foster kids coming in. Using \u201cIn this family\u201d get past the \u201cwell in my family we do it this way.\u201d \u00a0I simple respond with, in this family we do it this was. \u00a0This also works well with friends who are over visiting. \u00a0Some with use the Lords name in vain. \u00a0We simple say, \u201cIn this family we respect God\u2019s name. \u00a0Please don\u2019t use God\u2019s name in vain.\u201d\n\nPinterest really has some great and cleaver ideas for making family rules. \u00a0I thinks families have embraced family rules beyond the \u201cshould nots\u201d\n\nSave pagePDF pageEmail pagePrint page\n\nMakings of a Strong Family-Shares Responsibilities among its members\n\n6. \u00a0Shares Responsibilities among its members\n\nOh I could go in so many different directions here.\n\nWhen everyone works together things get done. \u00a0Faster. \u00a0 Better. \u00a0Easier.\n\nIs it a women\u2019s job? \u00a0Is it a man\u2019s job?\n\nLet\u2019s just agree some things men do better. \u00a0And other things women do better.\n\nFind the better and do them.\n\nIf the hubby cooks well, then enjoy it! \u00a0If the wife likes fixing things up, wahoo!\n\nIt is about stepping up and taking initiative to know when you need to step up.\n\nMy husband is good at this most days. \u00a0He will do dishes often. \u00a0And he puts the lefts overs away.\n\nBut guys, if your wife is having a tough day, and not feeling good-step up. \u00a0If baby is sticky, don\u2019t walk away like you didn\u2019t smell that. \u00a0Trash over flowing\u2026you get the idea!\n\nAnd gals, our guys work hard. \u00a0Do extra stuff for them when you can.\n\nAll over our house we are lacking this right now- initiative and shared responsibilities. \u00a0Unless mommy is giving out who is cleaning what. \u00a0It is not getting cleaned right now. \u00a0There are something that are getting done. \u00a0But I know this is where I have fallen in terms of good chores and shared responsibilities. \u00a0We have had list before, but then kids come out and in.\n\nAnd when I do ask them to clean some times I get screaming and whining. \u00a0And sometimes they do it with a cheerful heart. \u00a0And sometimes they do it without being asked.\n\nWe are going to work on this. \u00a0I have already a few ides in place for the beginning of summer. \u00a0This will be easier cause AnnieQ will be done with school and it will flow better.\n\nMy Kid Organization board on Pinterest has lots of ideas for chores. \u00a0Check it out!\n\nThis is part of my Making Strong Families Series.\n\nHow do you share responsibilities?\n\n\nSave pagePDF pageEmail pagePrint page\n\nMakings of a Strong Families: has a Sense of Play and Humor\n\n5. \u00a0Has a Sense of Play and Humor\n\nAll can be perfectly quiet, calm and before they know it, momma is doing something silly! \u00a0You got to! \u00a0Kids love that stuff, when moms and dads can be silly! \u00a0Watch the smiles on their faces when parents get down and play with them.\n\nWhen Robby was little he had lots of toys. \u00a0But the thing he loved best was when Dan got on the floor with him and played horse. \u00a0He loved that. \u00a0The smile beamed from his face! \u00a0Sadly many parents don\u2019t take the time to get down and play with their kids. \u00a0We often are tired or busy. \u00a0But kids they want us to play with them. \u00a0They would rather us take a ball and throw it with them than sit and watch TV or computer. \u00a0Kids would rather sit around the table playing a board game or cards on an evening then all this other stuff we have them in.\n\nFamilies have to play. \u00a0Together.\n\n\u00a0I don\u2019t always do a good job on the together part. \u00a0You often hear-go play-so I can get things done!\n\nI remember one time we were outside working on some yard work. \u00a0Before I knew it we had a football game going on. \u00a0The kids ate that up! \u00a0More so cause daddy was the one running the football! \u00a0Kids love parents when they play!\n\nMarriages do better when you can be silly every once and a while. \u00a0Or more. \u00a0Most marriages balance each other one, one a little bit more serious the other a little bit more silly. \u00a0Dan and I balance each other out! \u00a0I have the daily fun down better, he has the big fun down better.\n\nReally as I type this Isaiah walks out with a huge bead necklace, going \u201clook at me\u201d and \u201cshaking his booty!\u201d \u00a0Where\u2019s my camera?

        "text":"Friday, July 23, 2010\n\nBob, our tortoise is currently binging on tomato's in the garden--politely eating a whole entire tomato before moving onto the next tomato....i believe he may like our gardens better than the desert, no tomato's in the old desert......\n\nI have three books ordered---in Non Fiction two----one on the history of the1930's dust bowl of the Mid-west. Looking for survival information in that one...... another non-fiction on the strategic projections for Climate change---for example climate wars for water, food etc....and a science fiction anthology on future Metropolis's-----i'll give better details as they come in and are read...........\nNow streaming season 2 of the Sarah Conner Chronicles---- Ah! to be a 16 year old John Conner with my own hot terminator body guard who loves the universal balance of things-------the cost of being pursued by the nasty terminators would be so worth it.........\nNo working Rovio yet, still awaiting the promised replacement parts from the company----does this bother me---yes---can i do anything about it---no.\n\nI have 600 some odd days until I could retire and I may not go then based on the economy but i have already felt the effects of being retirement almost capable.\n\nI spoke with my boss last month and advised him that i was never cutting my hair again and did this bother him or the organization? He said no.....the truth or lie of the response doesn't matter to me on this issue. I'll be growing my hair into a tail for the remainder of my two years. There is no more need for me to impress--i have traveled as far down the work road as i am going to go success wise and it has been further than I ever believed possible.\nThe signs and symbols that were once necessary for me are not so any longer.\nI have (or am) stopping the purchasing of any type of work related clothing such as the dreaded necktie, sport coats, dress shirts etc. Why purchase any of this stuff if it will never be used ever again except in the casket and one outfit regardless of fit is enough.\nSo my new daily work outfit consists of black, EMT, 9 pocket pants, terra planna, worn again sneakers or boots and usually an expensive casual shirt as my daily business attire. I keep the dreaded sign of slavery---- the necktie off me as much as possible during the workday and although this is a demanded physical display to the rest of the Baboon troop for status indication. I bring one but it has been spending its time on sitting in the glove box of the Prius. Worn only for the dreaded meetings we all suffer through.\nIf by some chance I am caught tie-less I have created and committed to memory multiple excuses as to why I am not wearing one---to prevent howling attacks and shit throwing, by higher ranked baboons over my failure to comply to troop rules.It is that I can simply no longer accept demands from the work place as to how i look. I cannot be owned any longer and our most important display of independence, how we appear, has become important to me now for serious reasons. I will own myself.\nIt was actually special to go in and basically advise that I done with all this stupid valueless shit that's somehow made itself REQUIRED? So about the site i go developing what i call the new Geezer Tactical leave me the fuck alone look.....\n\nWell aren't we special eh?\nI've been feeling pretty positive about the only self for the past couple of days. I feel as if i have my daily equipment and essentials planned, obtained, and available like never before in a smaller, more positive and effective state of operation. I am reading, writing, computing, creating, and moving through life in a good state. Home is clean, organized, and a pleasure to live in and about right now.\nI for the most part feel in control in some way for a change----to the point where i think i may not collapse and die from stress like the lowest ranking baboon in the troop.\nI still stagger about engaged in projects of my own making. I obtained all the parts and supplies necessary today to rehabilitate a beat cruiser-style bicycle given to us. A project of art, mechanics, expense, and a public response when completed of \"why did you do this again?\" My required fundamentals in anything i approach, much like Doc Brown in back to the future.\nMy success's have pleased me and my failures have not discouraged me over the past few days and that is a very good sign. But as always no one expects the Spanish Inquisition.\nThe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald\n\n\nDavid Scott said...\n\nYour comments approaching reteriment is spot on.\nAs I approached my magic day eight months ago I became less tolerant of the beaucratic bull shit (BBS) to the point I once told a engineer that what he wanted done was the stupidest thing I ever heard and if he wanted it done do it himself.\n\nWarren said...\n\nthanks David\nyou are absolutely correct. The closer to retirement i get the more I become an Honest Oracle.\nthanks for the comment",

        "text":"Monday, May 21, 2012\n\nToybank Summer Bash!\n\n18 Toybankers eagerly awaited in UPG College on a Tuesday morning to welcome 200 children from Asha Kiran.\n\nThe children had a ball of a time in the Toybank Summer Bash! They were engaged in various activities from Origami to games, etc. They all were shown a fun movie \u2013 \u2018Krish, Trish & Baltiboy\u2019 which was sponsored by The Children\u2019s Film Society India.\nThe event started at 9.30am, the children in both the classes were told about 3 core rules for the day:\n  1. Not to make too much noise\n  2. Not to litter the classes\n  3. And to do masti!\nBoth the classes were filled with 100 children each! The event unfolded with the origami session in both the classes. One class was taught to make a rotating toy \u2013 \u2018Flexagon\u2019, and the other class was taught how to make a \u2018Star Frisbee\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn each of the classroom there were 8-10 volunteers helping out children to fold the papers and follow the instructor. At the end most of the children got the final toy made by themselves, and started helping their peers make the toy for themselves.\u00a0\n\nBoth the classes took a short break after the fun origami session, some of them were playing with their new toys they made, and some of them were munching on the snacks provided to them.\n\nAfter the break Toybank screened a movie for all the 200 children gathered at UPG College.\u00a0 The children enjoyed the movie \u2013 \u2018Krish, Trish & Baltiboy\u2019. The movie went on for around 1hour and 10 minutes. The movie DVD was sponsored by The Children\u2019s Film Society India.\nVolunteer stirred a discussion with the children in both the classes after the movie. Here are some of the responses from the children who saw the movie:\n  \u2022 Duriya Pande said that she liked movie because it was animated and her most favorite story was of lion and farmer because it shows how to take decision when we are faced with problems in life.\n  \u2022 Sabiya said that she liked the story of deer and family because the family members love each other, and ready to die for each other. Due to the bonding seen in the deer\u2019s family, the king in the story also learned a lesson and became good to all people.\n  \u2022 Surender said that he liked all the three stories because they were animated. He also said that the queen was greedy. The last story of farmer and tiger interested him as he was impressed by the way the farmer\u2019s wife solved the problems in her life..\n  \u2022 Gopal said that he learned to study and progress in life from these stories, One of the stories also taught him that we should be together in difficult times.\n  \u2022 Gaurav also learnt to smile in the face of difficulties and to solve problems happily, he also learnt that he should not condemn others and should not be greedy.\nAfter the discussion of the movie, the children were served lunch, later we had a short interaction with the children, and some of them promised to give a written feedback about their experience of the day and the learning\u2019s from the movie they has seen!\n\nThe NGO bus arrived at around 2pm to pick-up the kids from the College. The children went home very happy with smiles on their faces and a new toy made by them in their hands!\n\nWe thank Children Film Society India for lending us a copy of the DVD of Krish, Trish and Baltiboy.\n\nWe also thank Usha Pravin Gandhi College for letting us use their infrastructure for this event!\n\nToybank would also like to appreciate all the volunteers who attended this event and helped us execute the event smoothly.\n\nCheck out more pics of the event here\n\nNo comments:",

I know that probably sounds ominous to some people but in reality it is far from that. It\u2019s actually part of a 3-day celebration where friends and family remember loved ones who have passed away. Beginning on October 31st and running through November 2nd it includes a variety of activities including building \u201cofrendas\u201d or private altars and visiting the graves of the dead with gifts of sugar skulls, marigolds, and the foods and drinks the deceased enjoyed in life. This is not as macabre as some might think and certainly no different from many other cultures. The spirits of the deceased are encouraged to visit with the living so that they can hear the prayers offered for them as well as the memories of them shared by the living. These are often humorous tales. dia grave\n\nWhat could be nicer than spending time cleaning around a loved one\u2019s grave, placing colorful flowers (in this case marigolds which are said to draw the dead), and setting up these altars?

I always carry a Band Aid in my Wallet and offered to help. Saw his Finger which had some internal injury and small Blood Clot had appeared which would normally be healed with passage of time. But to pacify them, I told them to use a Band Aid and on application they seem to be happy. Probably a Psychological effect.\n\nNow, they had seen me clicking a Pic & asked me to click one of them and I obliged. I asked them if they have Mail accounts. None of them did.\n\nOne of them pointing a finger towards a Friend said\u2026.. \u201cIsko Bhej do, iske Papa ki Sarkaari naukri hai, wohi net karte hai\u201d\n\nOther pointing to another said \u201cIska Bhai to bahut net use karta hai\u201d\n\nThe Ones in School Uniform were Bunking School and were afraid that they may get caught.

He melts my heart with each smile. Between the two of them, I'm often lost in another reality. My two blessings are nothing less than sunshine in my day, chocolate in my afternoon, and love in my heart. If I could write daily about the adventures of 24\/7 diaper marathons, tandem bathing, duel body juggling acts, and the helicopter parenting that I seem to fall into more often than I want to admit, I would! There is more content than I wish to recognize-everything is a story worth sharing that I find my inner thoughts in conflict over how to prioritize my a blog entry to document the latest happening or carry on to bed for a brief respite between brewing unnatural sleep cycles. The latter generally wins hence another entry that is way late, hugely anticipated and thus, like Swiss Cheese, missing chunks!\nWhat feels like months ago was probably only six weeks ago; I woke up to solid poop in Dylan's diaper. MILESTONE. How has this already happened? He was just 3 months old and now I face his seventh month; the homemade baby food cubes are taking over the freezer, his birthweight has almost doubled and nursing habits are long ingrained within him that I fear my breasts will be forever harnessed in a nursing bra. While he can and will roll over, it is generally out of circumstance, a means to an end. He does not like being awake and lying on his tummy which leads me to believe he will bypass crawling and dive straight into climbing, standing and walking. Two teeth and swollen gums, his canines are proportionate to his hands and feet...all are large! He remains 'Chillin Dylan' unless the volcanic eruption begins and then it's hunt for Dylan already shows signs of resilience and superior endurance. Heck I might too if I was getting daily hits to the head by books and blocks with an occasional foot. Yes, Kaitlyn expresses her love for her brother with great force and often with a repetitive edge. Needless to say Dylan continues to chill and handle her strikes with a stoic immortality.\nThis brings me to dear Special K. Kaitlyn has an uncanny ability to comprehend exactly what you are telling her, look right through you like she isn't listening and then after all verbal threats and reprimands, galavant off and successfully complete the request. It drives me nuts. She is a 13 year old in the body of a 2 year old...well, ok, maybe not that extreme, but she is truly already showing remarkable acts of defiance.\nI'm not much of a reader and much to my husband's disdain, I'm not a pop culture hound, however, I do know that Special K has a keen sense of self and an intrinsic motivation for certain activities. My latest headline with her is PRESCHOOL. Where will she go, for how often each week, will she be the class bully or the class clown? Whatever the case, I'm really eager for this MILESTONE. She couldn't be more ready for engagement that is with someone other than her strung out, overly sensitive, hyper-hawk eyed mom...I'm sure I am making it out to be worse than it, I said it before, my children are my blessings-nothing less than sunshine in my day, chocolate in my afternoon, and love in my heart!",
