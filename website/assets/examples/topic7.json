        "text":"Friday, July 23, 2010\n\nBob, our tortoise is currently binging on tomato's in the garden--politely eating a whole entire tomato before moving onto the next tomato....i believe he may like our gardens better than the desert, no tomato's in the old desert......\n\nI have three books ordered---in Non Fiction two----one on the history of the1930's dust bowl of the Mid-west. Looking for survival information in that one...... another non-fiction on the strategic projections for Climate change---for example climate wars for water, food etc....and a science fiction anthology on future Metropolis's-----i'll give better details as they come in and are read...........\nNow streaming season 2 of the Sarah Conner Chronicles---- Ah! to be a 16 year old John Conner with my own hot terminator body guard who loves the universal balance of things-------the cost of being pursued by the nasty terminators would be so worth it.........\nNo working Rovio yet, still awaiting the promised replacement parts from the company----does this bother me---yes---can i do anything about it---no.\n\nI have 600 some odd days until I could retire and I may not go then based on the economy but i have already felt the effects of being retirement almost capable.\n\nI spoke with my boss last month and advised him that i was never cutting my hair again and did this bother him or the organization? He said no.....the truth or lie of the response doesn't matter to me on this issue. I'll be growing my hair into a tail for the remainder of my two years. There is no more need for me to impress--i have traveled as far down the work road as i am going to go success wise and it has been further than I ever believed possible.\nThe signs and symbols that were once necessary for me are not so any longer.\nI have (or am) stopping the purchasing of any type of work related clothing such as the dreaded necktie, sport coats, dress shirts etc. Why purchase any of this stuff if it will never be used ever again except in the casket and one outfit regardless of fit is enough.\nSo my new daily work outfit consists of black, EMT, 9 pocket pants, terra planna, worn again sneakers or boots and usually an expensive casual shirt as my daily business attire. I keep the dreaded sign of slavery---- the necktie off me as much as possible during the workday and although this is a demanded physical display to the rest of the Baboon troop for status indication. I bring one but it has been spending its time on sitting in the glove box of the Prius. Worn only for the dreaded meetings we all suffer through.\nIf by some chance I am caught tie-less I have created and committed to memory multiple excuses as to why I am not wearing one---to prevent howling attacks and shit throwing, by higher ranked baboons over my failure to comply to troop rules.It is that I can simply no longer accept demands from the work place as to how i look. I cannot be owned any longer and our most important display of independence, how we appear, has become important to me now for serious reasons. I will own myself.\nIt was actually special to go in and basically advise that I done with all this stupid valueless shit that's somehow made itself REQUIRED? So about the site i go developing what i call the new Geezer Tactical leave me the fuck alone look.....\n\nWell aren't we special eh?\nI've been feeling pretty positive about the only self for the past couple of days. I feel as if i have my daily equipment and essentials planned, obtained, and available like never before in a smaller, more positive and effective state of operation. I am reading, writing, computing, creating, and moving through life in a good state. Home is clean, organized, and a pleasure to live in and about right now.\nI for the most part feel in control in some way for a change----to the point where i think i may not collapse and die from stress like the lowest ranking baboon in the troop.\nI still stagger about engaged in projects of my own making. I obtained all the parts and supplies necessary today to rehabilitate a beat cruiser-style bicycle given to us. A project of art, mechanics, expense, and a public response when completed of \"why did you do this again?\" My required fundamentals in anything i approach, much like Doc Brown in back to the future.\nMy success's have pleased me and my failures have not discouraged me over the past few days and that is a very good sign. But as always no one expects the Spanish Inquisition.\nThe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald\n\n\nDavid Scott said...\n\nYour comments approaching reteriment is spot on.\nAs I approached my magic day eight months ago I became less tolerant of the beaucratic bull shit (BBS) to the point I once told a engineer that what he wanted done was the stupidest thing I ever heard and if he wanted it done do it himself.\n\nWarren said...\n\nthanks David\nyou are absolutely correct. The closer to retirement i get the more I become an Honest Oracle.\nthanks for the comment",

        "text":"What are Padrinos?\n\nEveryone has heard the term, but what are padrinos exactly? Well, in english, it directly translates to two things, either \u201cgodparents\u201d or \u201csponsors\u201d, and both definitions play an important role in the latino community. \u00a0Padrinos and madrinas are ultimately the fairy godparents that are there for you throughout your life and especially during your big life events. Traditionally, during big events like quinceaneras, weddings, and baptisms, padrinos are chosen to accompany the person (or persons) being celebrated during the church ceremony and throughout the reception. Traditionally, they also help pay for the religious items used in the ceremony, like the bible, cross, rings, etc.\n\nNowadays, padrinos contribute in many more ways too. Some offer monetary gifts to help the person(s) being celebrated and their family pay for the party. Others choose to help by donating their time and effort to help make things like food or decorations, or who help with the tiny-but-important details, like buying the party favors and drinks.\n\nMaria with her Padrino\n\nHere is a quick break down of all the potential padrinos and madrinas that you could have at your quinceanera or wedding:\n\n  \u2022 Padrinos and Madrinas\n\nPadrinos and Madrinas are there to help you with whatever you may need, but they aren\u2019t only there to help you financially. They are also there to be your mentors, someone to go to when help is needed. They can help guide the quincea\u00f1era through their next steps in life. This wedding and quinceanera tradition is still widely used, especially within the Mexican community. Your padrinos can be any of the following:\n\n  \u2022 Friends\n  \u2022 Family\n  \u2022 Neighbors\n\nIt can be anyone close to the quinceanera\/novios or someone who just wants to help!\n\n  \u2022 Padrinos de Honor\n\nThe Padrinos de honor are the main padrinos of your quinceanera or wedding. This is not to say that the others are not as important, but these, in particular, will accompany you throughout your whole event. In most cases, the Padrinos de Honor are typically the same ones from your baptism.\n\nThey will play a huge part in the ceremony, especially for a quinceanera. They will sit or stand near the quincea\u00f1era at certain times and present her with some of the important ceremonial items (see below). They are also traditionally supposed to help pay for most of the party, but, in today\u2019s day, you can have as many people help out as you want!\n\n  \u2022 Padrinos (Godparents)\n\nSome quincea\u00f1eras and couples also have actual padrinos (godparents) from baptism, communion, or confirmation. They are typically involved throughout your entire life, \u00a0including presenting you to one of the Catholic sacraments. They often help out with big life events in one way or another, since they have already been around for so many of them in the past.\n\n\nPadrinos can be chosen by the person and family holding the event, but many padrinos usually offer themselves to be a padrino. Padrinos are some of the most important people that will participate in your event. If you have padrinos already in place or have yet to choose them, accept every bit of help \u2014 it goes a long way in planning your party! When accepting, always keep in mind that their help comes from a place of love and excitement for the person(s) being celebrated.\n\nIf you are celebrating a quinceanera, make sure to check out our planning guide on quinceanera traditions here.\n\nDiscussion2 comments\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.

I know that probably sounds ominous to some people but in reality it is far from that. It\u2019s actually part of a 3-day celebration where friends and family remember loved ones who have passed away. Beginning on October 31st and running through November 2nd it includes a variety of activities including building \u201cofrendas\u201d or private altars and visiting the graves of the dead with gifts of sugar skulls, marigolds, and the foods and drinks the deceased enjoyed in life. This is not as macabre as some might think and certainly no different from many other cultures. The spirits of the deceased are encouraged to visit with the living so that they can hear the prayers offered for them as well as the memories of them shared by the living. These are often humorous tales. dia grave\n\nWhat could be nicer than spending time cleaning around a loved one\u2019s grave, placing colorful flowers (in this case marigolds which are said to draw the dead), and setting up these altars? Some bring toys for children, tequila or mescal for adults, or some special gift for the departed.\n\ndia altar\n\nOther countries also celebrate forms of Dia de Muertes with traditions of their cultures. Some communities have small parades to celebrate the day.dia parade\n\nAll these countries and cultures have one thing in common, a respectful and joyous remembrance of those who have passed on. From Europe, through Latin America, the Philippines, and the United States celebrations to recognize the dead are quite common. Each may have its own distinctive style and traditions but the central purpose is to recognize the place of the dead in the lives of the living.\n\ndia pops\nSo when the candy rush dissipates why not take a moment or two to remember those who went before and tell a sweet story about the time you shared?\n\ndia cookies\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Celebrity Look Alike\n\n\nFor years, and I mean at least 25+ years, people have come up to me and say that I look like someone they know.\u00a0 My face is so familiar to them.\u00a0 These people are women around my age that are also a product of sitcom in the 80\u2019s.\u00a0 \u201cExcuse me, Is your name Mindy?\u201d\u00a0 My answer is always no, but I know exactly what they are talking about.\u00a0 People think I look like and\/or am Mindy Cohn or Natalie from The Facts of Life.\u00a0 I do see the resemblance myself and it can be scary that I look more like her than I do my own sister.\u00a0 She was my favorite character on the show as well because I could relate to her and her sense of humor.\n\nHow people approach me is kind of funny. They are never rude and many start off by saying they were put up to it by their girlfriends who had been debating for a while now whether it is Mindy or not.\u00a0 Once I had a guy that knows me by name ask me.\u00a0 His response was that he was put up to asking since he knows me.\u00a0 He thought maybe I changed my name at some point.\n\nYesterday, a woman at the concert in the park approached me because I look so familiar to her.\u00a0 Again, \u201cIs your name Mindy?\u201d\u00a0 The funny part was that she admitted taking over 20 pictures of me and was googling Mindy Cohn on her phone to compare.\u00a0 She then said something like you know that some famous people don\u2019t look as good without make up and they thought maybe I was Mindy without make up.\u00a0 While this is funny.\u00a0 It sucks to be me as I was wearing make up and must still look like crap.\n\nI really need to come up with a better and witty come back for these times.\u00a0 I should also play along and charge people to take a picture with me.\n\nI know she is not a popular celebrity anymore, but I would still love to meet her and get a picture with her.\u00a0 I wonder if she knows she has a look alike out there and it is me.\u00a0\u00a0 What would people say to me if I tell them I am Mindy?\u00a0 How much fun could I have to screw with other people\u2019s minds?\n\n\nGoing to the Beach\u2026Is it worth the\u00a0trip?\n\nI live in Sunny Southern California, North Orange County to be exact and I have always loved going to the beach.\u00a0 Today was 95 degrees at\u00a0 home in my Anaheim Hills backyard that has a pool.\u00a0 I thought it was too hot to stay home and wanted something more than laying in the non-heated pool all day.\u00a0 To be fair, the pool is probably about 70 degrees and the spa can be any temperature I want it to be above that. I knew going to the beach would be a 30 minutes commute and would be 15-20 degrees less.\u00a0 The plus side about the beach is there are no distractions and the beach I go to does not have internet reception either.\n\nAs my family arrived at Corona Del Mar we unpacked our car and headed out to find a spot close to the water.\u00a0 Being that is was such a hot day, everyone and their mother was at the beach.\u00a0 Literally, it is Mother\u2019s Day and we were all there. It was crowded and almost had no personal space between beach towels, seaweed, and other people.\u00a0 But we were at the beach, so how bad can it really be?\n\nThe weather at the beach was overcast yet still warm enough that you had to go in the water to get cooled off.\u00a0 My first thought is why did I leave my backyard to go to the beach and go in the 63 degree water?\u00a0 I think it is so funny that I will not go in my pool at home when the water is less than 80 degrees, but at the beach the water never gets warmer than 68 degrees and I go in.\u00a0 Why do I feel it is less disgusting to go in the ocean to take care of number 1 rather than go use the public restrooms way up across the sand?\u00a0\n\nThree hours of uninterrupted family time and the inability to check Facebook was great.\u00a0 The people watching is wonderful and it is so easy to listen to other\u2019s conversations which I thoroughly enjoy.\u00a0 This time nobody had music playing, so it was us, nature, and 1000+ other beach goers.\u00a0 It is also fun to see what bathing suits people think it is acceptable to wear and how confident they must be with their bodies to wear something so skimpy where their ass is completely hanging out. Who can resist watching the little kids build sand castles and burying themselves in the sand?\u00a0\n\nWhen it is time to go home, it takes 30 minutes to pack up, rinse off all the sand, and get back in the car for the 30 minute ride home.\u00a0 Once you are home, you have to take another shower and put away the beach gear. It seems like a lot of work.\u00a0 The reality is that if I stayed home in the backyard I would have had to clean the backyard and the pool and it is Mother\u2019s Day after all.\u00a0 Going to the beach is just a nice way to do something different and get away from it all.\n\nFor as much work as it is to have a pleasant day out at the beach is it worth it?\u00a0 Do other people not go in their pool water when it is less than 80, yet think nothing of going in the 63 degree ocean water?\u00a0\n\n\nWhen all is said and done, the uninterrupted family time and a chance to get a little color is always worth it to me.\u00a0 A change of scenery and a day out of the norm is a good day out.\n\nYou\u2019re Never Too Old to Make Good\u00a0Friendships\n\nIt is funny how friendships change as we grow older. Growing up and through college I wanted friends that were at similar stages in life like me. I wanted friends that were my age and had little drama. After college came challenging years where I hung on to school friendships and then people start moving away and getting married. After I was married and my children had not entered school yet, my dream was to have friends close by where the husband and wife were still together, had children in the same age range as mine, and where my husband and I liked the other couple and not just the wife. This was a true struggle for a few years, but then the turning point hit when my kids started school.\n\nAs the kids were old enough to be in scouts and start playing sports, we have had the opportunity to make that dream of mine come true. We have met some of the best families through sports and scouts. I have to admit that it is easy to make friends when you have a pool and like hosting social gatherings. One invitation can lead to a lifetime of friendship.\n\nIt is wonderful to make new friends at middle age although I hate to admit we are in that range. At this stage of our lives, the friends we make are not pretentious, but are gracios and truly happy to accept the invitations especially when they don\u2019t have to get a babysitter. It is so ideal when the kids hang out and the parents hang out and all get along. Also, the adults recognize what it takes to have someone over and all offer to bring something. We have had many gatherings where families bring appetizers, drinks, and more than enough side dishes or other food. We also recognize that we are all busy, nothing is perfect and the chance to relax with friends stress-free is golden. Because we are so busy some of the best times have been with last minute invites like one we were invited to at 9:00 am the day of the get together.\n\nWe have made the best friends through cub scouts due to the many family activities involved. Sports friends are easy to make as well by just going out for pizza after the game. The best part of the friends we have is that the invitations are not one way. If you get invited to someone\u2019s home it is great to reciprocate and I think some people don\u2019t get that part. Reciprocation can be in the form of an outing or time at the park, but it does not have to be in your home only.\n\nIt continues to be a wonderful journey in life when you open your home, open your heart, and reach out to new people. You never know when people may move away so you need to continue to make new friends every year. It is work that is well worth the payoff.\n\nThe Girl Scouts could not have said it better than in the first song we learned in scouting:\n\nMake new friends and keep the old,\n\nOne is silver and the other is gold.\n\nWhat new friendships are you working on?\n\nGoing through life with the right\u00a0partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband is a good man, husband, and father.\u00a0 There is no gaurantee in life that when you get married you are making the right choice.
