        "text":"Thursday, May 20, 2010\n\nCalm before the storm.\n\nDylan's first swing experience!\n\nMemphis, TN...visiting with cousin Truman (Kaitlyn douses herself with the water and Truman watches with great intrigue-Special K did change his routine up quite a bit during our visit)!\n\nTandem bathing!\n\nAuntie Cupcake with Chillin Dylan!\n\nShe's magical in my eyes even when she's up to no good. He melts my heart with each smile. Between the two of them, I'm often lost in another reality. My two blessings are nothing less than sunshine in my day, chocolate in my afternoon, and love in my heart. If I could write daily about the adventures of 24\/7 diaper marathons, tandem bathing, duel body juggling acts, and the helicopter parenting that I seem to fall into more often than I want to admit, I would! There is more content than I wish to recognize-everything is a story worth sharing that I find my inner thoughts in conflict over how to prioritize my a blog entry to document the latest happening or carry on to bed for a brief respite between brewing unnatural sleep cycles. The latter generally wins hence another entry that is way late, hugely anticipated and thus, like Swiss Cheese, missing chunks!\nWhat feels like months ago was probably only six weeks ago; I woke up to solid poop in Dylan's diaper. MILESTONE. How has this already happened? He was just 3 months old and now I face his seventh month; the homemade baby food cubes are taking over the freezer, his birthweight has almost doubled and nursing habits are long ingrained within him that I fear my breasts will be forever harnessed in a nursing bra. While he can and will roll over, it is generally out of circumstance, a means to an end. He does not like being awake and lying on his tummy which leads me to believe he will bypass crawling and dive straight into climbing, standing and walking. Two teeth and swollen gums, his canines are proportionate to his hands and feet...all are large! He remains 'Chillin Dylan' unless the volcanic eruption begins and then it's hunt for Dylan already shows signs of resilience and superior endurance. Heck I might too if I was getting daily hits to the head by books and blocks with an occasional foot. Yes, Kaitlyn expresses her love for her brother with great force and often with a repetitive edge. Needless to say Dylan continues to chill and handle her strikes with a stoic immortality.\nThis brings me to dear Special K. Kaitlyn has an uncanny ability to comprehend exactly what you are telling her, look right through you like she isn't listening and then after all verbal threats and reprimands, galavant off and successfully complete the request. It drives me nuts. She is a 13 year old in the body of a 2 year old...well, ok, maybe not that extreme, but she is truly already showing remarkable acts of defiance.\nI'm not much of a reader and much to my husband's disdain, I'm not a pop culture hound, however, I do know that Special K has a keen sense of self and an intrinsic motivation for certain activities. My latest headline with her is PRESCHOOL. Where will she go, for how often each week, will she be the class bully or the class clown? Whatever the case, I'm really eager for this MILESTONE. She couldn't be more ready for engagement that is with someone other than her strung out, overly sensitive, hyper-hawk eyed mom...I'm sure I am making it out to be worse than it, I said it before, my children are my blessings-nothing less than sunshine in my day, chocolate in my afternoon, and love in my heart!",

        "text":"Saturday, January 7, 2012\n\nAirport Goodbyes Aren\u2019t Fun\n\nGrand Floridian\n\nAfter spending a few gorgeous days in Disney and then a few freezing days, and then another good day (please don\u2019t ask my why the weather is always crazy for New Year\u2019s when we spend it at Walt Disney World), Husband and I flew home to St. Louis and spent an insane 32 hours of unpacking, laundry, errands and repacking.\n\nAt noon today, my husband boarded a plane for Europe; Paris, to be exact. He is going to be there for at least three months, studying European business law. Saying goodbye at the airport was maybe one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. They let me get a companion pass so I got to sit next to him at the gate while the clock ticked down the minutes we had left together before he jetted off to Europe. And then when they called his row to board? I really kind of lost it. For the second time today.\n\nAs we were leaving the house, he realized he didn\u2019t have his phone. It must have still been plugged in upstairs. He looked and me smiled, and said he guessed he didn\u2019t need it! We didn\u2019t do the international phone package, because we are planning on using Skype to stay in touch. That way, we can actually see each other\u2019s faces when we catch up! But when he said that he didn\u2019t need his phone, it dawned on me that he was going to another continent where I wouldn\u2019t be able to pick up the phone and call him, or text him, or get in touch with him instantly as I\u2019m used to doing. He was going to be staying at an apartment with a roommate, an apartment where I don\u2019t know where it is, or anything about his living arrangements. Honestly, it scared the scrap out of me. And I lost it. Literally, it was the biggest ugly cry I had let him see in a looooong while. He put down his bags, enveloped me in his big arms, and told me it was going to be alright.\n\nAnd then he had me get his phone. I\u2019m not sure if he really thought he needed it, or if it was just to calm me down, but it does make me feel better. Long distance charges be damned, if he needs to call me, I sure don\u2019t care about those costs!\n\nIf all goes according to plan, I will see him again in May when he comes home for some family graduations. We are all keeping our fingers crossed about his internship possibilities in Europe, which would keep him there until August. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m hoping that he gets the internship or that he doesn\u2019t, because he would come home earlier if he doesn\u2019t.\n\nHonestly, I just want him to get the education and experience that he needs in Europe and comes back to me as quickly as possible. Because this townhouse is awfully quiet this afternoon with only me here.\n\n\n  1. Paris is lovely in the spring for a visit... Just Sayin'\n\n  2. Oh. You are a stronger woman than I. I can't even imagine. At least you can be certain that 1) absence makes the heart grow fonder, and 2)this is for the greater good. In a down economy, he is going to be so very marketable.",
