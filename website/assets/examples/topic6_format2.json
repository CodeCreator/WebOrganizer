Nowhere to be found when we was underground\nStrugglin', but now you come around all of a sudden, checkin' wallets for dollars, you bug me\nI give promise to those who knew us when we was nothing 'cuz that's the truth\nForm of support that was pure, we had yours from the doorground floor\nAnd evaded the rhymes and finally made it, you wasn't fishy, never gonna be unappreciated\n\n\nIt's true that gold rules the whole globe, diamond no close\nWell, there were art of inlays with gold fixtures\n'til I remain a bitch to the dollar. Admit it\nInsulate it with the Philly caps the facts that's good cash\nBut the fact remains material gains can't steer the clever pains\nThis lifestyle musta formed a nice while\nBut i'll state the grass was kinda greener in a leaner pasture\nI wouldn't give up livin' with hip hop for love was much cleaner\nIt's a fine line tryin' to get some money plus represent for me\nWhat to choose what imitation is against the paycheck\nRockin' dashin' fashions and stashin' cash hits, but what is this\nAm I a business man or just a heavy spendage?\nI got ten times the ends but only half the real friends\nLying in plus settin' bettin' one thousand would break houses\nBut what counts is I tol' all my soul I'm just a slave to chasin' of the paper\n\n\nLyrics taken from\n\n  \u2022 Email\n  \u2022 Correct\n\n\n      Write about your feelings and thoughts\n\n      Know what this song is about?

        "text":"TI Vol 13: Chapter 12-1\n\nPrevious Chapter Next Chapter\n\nVol 13: Chapter 12-1.\n\nImhotep and Anck-Su-Namun were sitting on the sofa quietly. Imhotep didn\u2019t need to consume any food while Anck-Su-Namun was enjoying a cup of coffee and cakes. When Xuan turned to them, Imhotep refused. \u201cI have no obligation to help you. We haven\u2019t come to any terms yet.\u201d\n\nZheng asked. \u201cI have been curious. Why did you come to New York with the others? Are you seeking the mask too? You can\u2019t even turn into a monster since you are not a normal human. What would you need it for?\u201d\n\nImhotep nodded. \u201cYes. I don\u2019t have any use for the mask but Anck-Su-Namun could. If we use the diamond on the mask, she won\u2019t turn into a monster. Otherwise, she is growing older day by day. I can help you fight the monster but the mask must belong to me.\u201d\n\nEvelyn coughed to get their attention. \u201cWhat the murals depicted is only a possibility. You should be aware that the monster and the vampires it made will burn to dust upon contact with sunlight. Yet, it says to shine concentrated sunlight on the mask\u2019s forehead. Are you sure about taking this risk?\u201d\n\nAnck-Su-Namun looked hesitated. No normal person would want anything to do with the mask after seeing the experiments on the flesh even if the mask brought immense power. Especially a woman as beautiful as her. However, Imhotep didn\u2019t seem to get her feelings and acted stubborn.\n\nZheng had to enlighten him. \u201cImhotep, stop acting so selfish. Is it fine turning your lover into a monster just so you can be with her forever? Do you love her or yourself?\u201d\n\nImhotep turned to Anck-Su-Namun with doubts. She looked back at him with a pair of pitiful eyes. He hesitated before saying with difficulty. \u201cAt least let me experiment the mask on an animal. If it really turns into a monster, I will give the mask to you. Give me that piece of flesh.\u201d He held out his hand to Xuan.\n\nXuan handed him the bottle with the largest piece. Imhotep opened the cap then the flesh instantly shot out at his hand and trying to dig its way in.\n\nEveryone was shocked. The women screamed and the men all stood up. Imhotep waved his hand and said. \u201cNot a problem. My body is different from yours.\u201d His whole arm transformed to a wave of sand then back to an arm. On his palm was a piece of dehydrated flesh.\n\nImhotep smiled at them then tore the flesh in half. There was no sign of regeneration anymore.\n\nXuan took over a piece and pondered for a moment. He opened the saline solution bottle and threw it in. The thin slice that was originally inside the solution surrounded the dehydrated flesh. As it absorbed the solution, the dehydrated flesh grew back up and in the end, merged with the thin slice.\n\n\u201cDehydration only takes away the cells\u2019 ability to move but not kill them. The only methods we know that can destroy the cellular structure in a short time are strong acid and base, fire, and sunlight. Silver will poison the cells and disable the cells\u2019 ability to split, but won\u2019t kill them.\u201d Xuan shook his head and said.\n\nZheng breathed out. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Not all battles have a perfect solution. Just like you said, 50% chance of success is worth taking the risk. I will assign the roles now. Imhotep and I will be our main attackers. Since the monster already fought me and absorbed some of my blood, his strength and speed are exceptionally fast. Firearms aren\u2019t fatal to him but if he gets inside your body, you will turn into a vampire. So the two of us are the only ones that can get near him.\u201d\n\n\u201cZero will support us from afar. Your first targets will be his legs. It takes him time to regenerate. So if he tries to run, blast off his legs. I will use Explosion or even Destruction to beat him down. Imhotep then take the chance to dehydrate him, every single cell. Afterward, we will just have to wait for sunrise. Which means our attack starts at before dawn!\u201d\n\nOnce their strategy was decided, they were left with determining the time and how to find the monster. Even though the flesh were alive on their own but could they still return to the main body when they were separated so far away? No one knew but they decided to test this possibility at 4am.\n\n\u201cKampa can come with us to help clear the vampires on the side and offer fire support when needed. Everyone else stay in the hotel. WangXia, Xuan, and O\u2019Connell protect them. Lan keeps our communication in place. Any questions?\u201d Zheng finished talking then asked.\n\nThe others shook their heads and Jonathan said with excitement. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We will stay in the hotel and won\u2019t interfere with your fight in any way. I promise.\u201d\n\nZheng smiled bitterly. \u201cWhy do your words feel like a thorn to my ears? Like some accident is prone to happen to make you mess the fight up.\u201d\n\nXuan frowned. \u201cThere might be an accident. I seemed to have missed something in my calculations, something critical. Let me go over my thoughts again. A person obtained the golden mask, turned into a monster then killed the group of archeologists and everyone in the town. You escaped by luck. Jonathan stole a fragment of the mask. The monster wanted to retrieve this fragment and obtain the diamond so he chased after you and kidnapped Alex on the way. Then he followed you to New York.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connell and Evelyn looked at each other then nodded. Xuan rubbed his temples. \u201cWhich means he had two chances of killing you but he didn\u2019t. While you managed to steal a fragment from him. He also has a sense of connection to the fragment but you mailed it to Cairo instead of carrying along. That was why he kidnapped Alex. So I was wrong since the beginning. This monster has a high level of intelligence. He let Jonathan steal the fragment so he could follow you to the diamond. Yet, after you mailed away the fragment, he had to kidnap Alex instead.\u201d\n\nXuan bit his finger. \u201cI know the reason the mission includes protecting Alex\u2019s life and preventing him from turning into a vampire. The monster had already injected his cell into Alex\u2019s body. He can easily find our location and ambush us. Once the cell grows, Alex will turn into a vampire! F*ck. He might be in the hotel already.\u201d\n\nThe sound of glass shattered came from the room Alex was sleeping in right as he finished talking.\n\n\n5 thoughts on \u201cTI Vol 13: Chapter 12-1\u201d - NO SPOILERS and NO CURSING\n\n  1. This entire scenario already feels very much unnecessary, Xuan should\u2019ve already told everyone to use silver in case the Jojo vampire will arrive, even before they went back to the movie, yet here we are. I think I\u2019ll just skip this conflict.\n\nLeave a Reply",

Old habits die hard.\nNotes: Written for waltzmatildah at fandomaid, who requested \"Katherine is above all this\" fic, with bonus Elijah.\n\nA Proposal\n\nVampires love universities. They\u2019re full of drunken students looking for a good time who won\u2019t care that they don\u2019t remember anything in the morning. Nobody bats an eye at a nocturnal lifestyle. And best of all, it\u2019s perfectly normal to move on after three or four years, before anyone notices that she hasn\u2019t aged. She can graduate and never see these people again.\n\nA few vampires treat the experience in earnest. She knew a guy called Trevor who collected degrees like a hobby. Most take the opportunity to have fun.\n\nKatherine is definitely the second type.\n\nShe tells her friends that she\u2019s a languages student. Italian and Russian, to be precise, because she\u2019s fluent in the former and a little rusty in the latter, and she figures there\u2019s no harm in brushing up her skills.\n\nWhen she\u2019s not reading Russian literature, she\u2019s hooking up with the local vampire population (they have their own society), fulfilling her own personal mission to dine at every college hall, and partying. She kills one vampire who recognises her and another who annoys her, but generally speaking they\u2019re a fun bunch. She brings back the hunting game that was once a popular tradition in the city \u2013 not one that the tour guides normally talk about, since it involves a pack of ravenous vampires gleefully chasing down a group of terrified students through the quad.\n\nAt the end of the night, she thanks the porters for their diligent work in blocking off every exit, wipes the blood off her mouth, and returns to her room in high spirits.\n\nLife is good.\n\nLife is good, until the day that Katherine walks into a study to meet her thesis supervisor, and discovers that the pleasant and knowledgeable Dr. E. Zhirinovsky she\u2019s been exchanging emails with is in fact Elijah.\n\nDear fucking Lord.\n\nElijah is a professor.\n\nOf course he is.\n\nHe\u2019s sitting in an oversized dark green leather armchair behind an intricately carved mahogany desk, surrounded by the smell of books and polished wood, and old-world elegance.\n\nShe does a heel turn so fast she thinks her boots may leave a trail of smoke behind her, but it\u2019s too late. He sees her. There\u2019s a moment when their eyes meet and his gaze pierces right through her \u2013 she feels it, like an electric shock, and she runs, runs, runs, but it makes no difference.\n\nA hand grips her arm like a vice. She turns back and there he is, right there, the dark flash of triumph in his eyes.\n\nHer breath catches. Elijah. She has nightmares about him, sometimes. Not so much now, and less often than her dreams featuring Klaus, but she never forgot his face. His eyes. She fears the power of his gaze, even when her blood is laced with vervain. He only has to look at her, and she\u2019s caught.\n\nNever get caught. Never be seen. Rules that Katherine Pierce lives by. She curses herself for being so careless.\n\n\u201cKaterina,\u201d he says. \u201cMy office is this way.\u201d\n\nHis voice is low and pleasant, polite. It chills her to the bone.\n\nHe escorts her back to his study, walking just at her shoulder. She can practically feel his breath on her neck, and she has to hold herself still, attempt to calm her racing heart. It\u2019s deliberate; she knows that, everything Elijah does is deliberate. He has the art of terror down to the bare minimum in efficiency, and Katherine is terrified.\n\nThey enter the study. The door clicks softly shut behind her.\n\nKatherine lets out a shaky breath. Elijah moves over to lean against his desk, watching her as she surveys the room. There are no other exits. The window is latched shut. She\u2019s still trapped but now that he\u2019s further away from her, she has space to think. She needs to come up with a plan, and fast.\n\nFirst tactic: stall.\n\n\u201cDid you lure me in here?\u201d she asks. \u201cWas that the plan?\u201d\n\nElijah\u2019s eyebrows lift. \u201cAs I recall, you came here willingly.\u201d He turns to pick up a paper from his desk, scanning it. \u201cYou wished to discuss the subject of your thesis proposal. The Brothers Karamazov.\u201d\n\nHe can\u2019t be serious. She recalls what she learned about him from his assumed identity. He\u2019s a visiting lecturer from the University of Amsterdam. He has a string of impressive-sounding qualifications and published research to his name. And he\u2019s teaching 19th century Russian literature.\n\nHe probably is teaching 19th century Russian literature, she thinks. None of the other vampires mentioned him. Maybe he compelled them, or maybe his cover is just that good.\n\nKatherine purses her lips. \u201cIsn\u2019t that all academic?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be the point.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s playing with her. She can see the amused glint in his eyes. Of course it\u2019s all academic \u2013 everything between them is; it\u2019s been five hundred years, after all, and in those centuries everything has changed for both of them except that he still hunts her and she is still hunted. Some habits persist.\n\nShe\u2019s the girl who likes to be chased, but not like this. This is no fun.\n\nElijah seems to wait a moment for her to appreciate his joke. When she fails to do so, he discards the paper and becomes all business. \u201cActually, I have a proposal for you. Are you aware of my brother\u2019s recent activities?\u201d\n\n\u201cKlaus?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cI know he\u2019s not looking for me.\u201d\n\nWhich begs the question of why Elijah is here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s no longer true,\u201d Elijah tells her.\n\nHer heart jumps. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nKlaus is looking for her? She had been relying on him doing exactly the opposite of that. Elena was supposed to provide enough of a distraction to give her at least a few years free of him. A knot of anxiety tightens in her stomach.\n\nElijah explains. \u201cKlaus is looking for a cure. A cure for vampirism.\u201d\n\nShe stares. She\u2019s never heard of such a thing. No witch she has ever talked to \u2013 and Katherine has known quite a few witches in her time \u2013 ever mentioned it. No vampire either.\n\n\u201cA cure,\u201d she repeats, as if to make sure that she heard the word correctly.\n\n\u201cHe wants the cure for Elena,\u201d Elijah goes on. \u201cHer blood is the key to turning more hybrids \u2013 but only if she is human. However, Elena is not the only doppelganger around.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cKlaus sent you,\u201d she whispers. Her body feels cold. He wants to turn her human too, so that he has two blood sources to use in order to create his pathetic hybrids instead of one. She can hardly think of a worse fate.\n\nElijah steps forward, and again her first instinct is to bolt, but there\u2019s something else going on here, something contemplative in his expression that she can\u2019t quite read.\n\n\u201cI have no desire to stand idly by while Klaus rebuilds his hybrid army,\u201d he says in a low voice. \u201cSince he is invulnerable, I am left with two options. Destroy the doppelgangers. Or...\u201d\n\n\u201cDestroy the cure,\u201d she breathes. That\u2019s why he\u2019s here. If he was going to kill her, he would have done it already. And it\u2019s not because of her that he won\u2019t, she can figure that part out. No, it\u2019s \u2013 her lip curls \u2013 precious Elena. She\u2019d wonder how Elena does it when the girl is such a drip, but she is a Petrova. They do whatever it takes to survive, and if that means lying with the devil, Katherine will do it too. \u201cSo you want my help.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the cure exists, I want to find it before Klaus does. I believe that may also be in your interest.\u201d\n\nHe says it carefully, she notes. It\u2019s the first thing he\u2019s said that\u2019s less an order and more of a suggestion; he\u2019s gauging her reaction. Katherine smiles.\n\nHere it is, finally: an opportunity.

(He notices the camera) Oh! Um... Hi! Um...hi.\n\nNarrator: Would you join me in magic adventures on my pony unicorn (which can drill into the ground with its penis) to the center of the Earth?\n\nNC: (looks bewildered)...WHAT THE HELL KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?! Um... I don\u2019t know.\n\nNarrator: Why does hair grow on my hands?\n\n\nNarrator: How do I know if the KGB is watching me?\n\nNC: Are these really the kind of questions he gets?
