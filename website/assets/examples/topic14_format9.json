        "text":"I have had pups my whole life, and ive come across tips that work and that dont work. BUT i am always on the lookout to \u00a0best help out my furry friend. So here are some recent discoveries and older discoveries that i use!\u00a0\n1. If your pup eats fast, try putting a ball in their bowl to help slow them down. This definitely worked on one of my dogs but the other one just sat anad looked at it.\n\n2. A carabiner makes it a quick and easy way to secure your pups leash when you are out in public. I showed this trick to my aunt and uncle and they use it all the time.\n\n3. Doggy CPR. This is very helpful in a scary situation, luckily i have never had to use it on my pups and hopefully you will never have to use it on yours but it is very helpful thing to know just incase.\n\n4. Play fetch down hill. My pup Bambi(RIP) loved playing fetch, he was also very hyper and this worked out very well for us and he loved it.\n\n5. Easily remove pet hair from your carpet by usuing a squeegee. I have never tried this one personally but my aunt has and she says it works.\n\n6. Know your pups language. If you can read your furry friends body language than its easier for you to help them and know what they might do next and you can stop the situation before it even becomes a situation. This goes for other dogs as well. Read other pups body language. \u00a0\n\n7. Baking soda and vinager helps get pet urine out of your carpet.\n\n8. Know what harms your pup, this is helpful in so many ways because it can keep your furry friend safe.\n\n9. If your pup hates when you brush their teeth squeeze some dog toothpaste onto a nylabone or a rope toy.\n\n10. If your pup isnt feeling too well, just add some low sodium chicken broth to their drinking water.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*this helps with puppy dehydration and if they cant keep the food down.\n\nAnother fun little suggestion i have done with my pups is make sure i have the vet number in my phone and a 24 hour vet number and address in my phone just to be on the safe side incase anything were to happen.",

        "text":"6 Royal Docks developments that will boost buy-to-let returns\n\nIf you really can measure a booming property market by the number of cranes in the sky, then London\u2019s Royal Docks will leave you breathless. Take the DLR from Canning Town just 5 minutes into the heart of Royal Docks and you\u2019ll see a horizon full of developments at different stages of construction.\n\nWhen Royal Docks was unveiled as both an Enterprise Zone and an Opportunity Area, developers rushed to bid for brownfield sites. The result is phenomenal: 15,000 new homes and 40,000 jobs are being created in an area 4km long; a distance equivalent of a walk from Oxford Circus to Bank.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the major Royal Docks developments currently under construction and the ideas still on the drawing board.\n\n1. \u00a33.5bn regeneration of Silvertown Quays\n\nSilvertown Quays is a 27.4-hectare site within Royal Docks. With Royal Victoria Dock to the North and Pontoon Dock at its heart, the development site has more than its fair share of prime waterfront views.\n\nIt contains several historical buildings from London\u2019s rich dockside past that add to the charm and character of the area. These include Millennium Mills, the Rank Hovis Building and the Grade II listed Silo D, which will be restored and incorporated into the wider development.\n\nA series of \u2018Brand Pavilions\u2019 will give the area a unique feel and will act as an innovation hub. A Floating Village will see 15 acres of water converted into a collection of buoyant homes, caf\u00e9s, shops and restaurants bobbing below the Emirates Air Line.\n\nThe development will create up to 20,680 jobs in office, retail and leisure sectors and around 3,000 homes.\n\n2. \u00a33.7bn regeneration of Canning Town and Custom House\n\n10,000 new homes are under construction in Canning Town as part of a massive regeneration project that will also revamp two town centers by 2024.\u00a0The project will provide up to 5,000 new jobs.\n\nHallsville Quarter\u00a0is the \u00a3600m town centre project for Canning Town. It will provide 1,100 new homes, 15 new shops, a hotel, cinema and gym over the course of 5 phases. Work began in 2012 and so far 179 residential units, a large Morrisons supermarket and underground parking are already complete.\n\nThe\u00a0Rathbone Market\u00a0development that includes the iconic Vermillion Tower will provide 650 new homes, shops, a market square and a library.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a31.7bn Asian Business Port\n\nABP London in Royal Albert Dock is a development that will create 20,000 jobs, 1,000 homes and add \u00a36 billion to London\u2019s economy.\n\nThe 35-acre site will eventually be home to over 3.2 million sq ft of work, retail and leisure space, including 2.5 million sq ft of prime office space, creating a vibrant, district on London\u2019s waterways.\n\nABP is the largest commercial development of its kind in the UK and will attract financial, high-tech and knowledge-based Asian industries looking to establish their business in the UK and European markets, as well as businesses looking to trade with them. When complete, the site will become London\u2019s third business district and should generate \u00a323m a year in business rates.\n\n4. 3,400 homes in Royal Wharf\n\nRoyal Wharf\u00a0is a 363,000 Sqm waterfront development from two leading developers, Oxley Holdings Limited and Ballymore UK. It consists of 3,400 apartments and townhouses, as well as approximately 20,000 sqm of office and retail space. The project will incorporate a new town square, high street retail, restaurants, bars & leisure space, there are also plans for a new school and medical centre.\n\nThe development also features a riverside park, linking the proposed Royal Wharf Pier, Royal Wharf Amphitheatre & Riverside Walk. When finished, it will be home to around 10,000 people.\n\n5. Crossrail\u00a0at Custom House\n\nCustom House will open as a Crossrail station\u00a0in 2018. \u00a0A journey to Canary Wharf will take just 3 minutes, and Tottenham Court Road will take only 15. Even Heathrow airport will under 45 minutes away.\n\nProperty research giants JLL expect prices near Custom House to grow 40.5% from 2014-2020 due to Crossrail alone. They also forecast that rental values will rise by 28% in the same period.\n\n6. Growth at London City Airport\n\nRoyal Docks has unrivalled links to London City Airport. The airport\u2019s fast turnaround times make it the number one choice for business travellers and frequent flyers. It has just added transatlantic flights to New York to its roster and with the growth of Royal Docks you can expect more routes to be added in the coming years.\n\nLondon City Airport is applying for planning permission to expand its operations, including infrastructure improvements and greater passenger facilities to meet rising demand.\n\nFuture projects in Royal Docks\n\nProposals for a new cycle and pedestrian\u00a0bridge across Royal Victoria Dock\u00a0will improve upon the current footbridge from Silvertown Quays to Custom House DLR. Crucially, it will also improve access to the future Crossrail station. If the project goes ahead, Custom House will be just 500 metres away.\n\nA consultation is underway for a\u00a0Silvertown Tunnel\u00a0that will link Royal Victoria Dock with the Greenwich Peninsula in taking roughly the same route as the Emirates Air Line. The tunnel is a \u2018Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project\u2019 and if all goes to plan, would start construction in 2018 with an opening scheduled for 2022\/2023.\n\nSince May 2015, the Mayor of London has actively been seeking a development partner to redevelop\u00a0Albert Island\u00a0in Royal Docks. The Mayor wants to create new commercial space to attract employers and improve connections at Gallions Reach and King George V DLR stations.\n\nThere\u2019s also a proposal to transform\u00a0Royal Albert Basin\u00a0into a state-of-the-art commercial boatyard.\n\n\nRoyal Docks Investment Summary\n\nRight now,\u00a0Royal Docks\u00a0isn\u2019t much to look at. The historic buildings give shades of past glory, and the cranes hint at the potential of the site, but the ripples have started. The first phases of some residential developments are nearing completion and by the time Crossrail opens the entire area will be well on its way to a total transformation.\n\nWith 40,000 jobs created there will be massive demand from the new local working population, but also from people viewing Royal Docks as a lifestyle choice.\n\n13 million visitors each year are expected to explore Silvertown Quays alone. Add this to the growing social infrastructure across all the developments and the future pull to the area is going to be huge.\n\nAs owning a property within London continues to be out of the reach of most, rental demand is only going one way, especially in the Royal Docks area where there are quick transport links to central London. That\u2019s why buying an off-plan property in today\u2019s market promises to be a particularly lucrative investment.\n\nAccess our London Property & Opportunities",

You have floss, fabric and other necessary accessories to keep track of. Staying organized, especially when you have a big project, will keep you stress free and allow you to enjoy the cross stitch pattern you are working on.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 02 of 06\n\n    Organizing Floss\n\n    Sugar Cookie\n\n    Whether you like to keep your floss in the original package, or wind it on a bobbin; there are a wide variety of options for keeping your thread organized.\u00a0\n\n    If you want to keep the floss as is, a Stitch Bow Floss Organizer is the way to go. You simply place the floss on the top and bottom of the bow. Once you have it on the bow, you can place it in a binder.\u00a0\n\n    For skeins that are used and you have scraps left; bobbins \u00a0are great ways to keep your floss in order. You can use the simple plastic bobbins on a key chain or you can get a bit more fancy by using cute wood bobbins. Be sure to purchase a bobbin winder, it will make the winding go much faster.\u00a0\n\n    If you just want to organize the floss for a particular project, a floss organizer is the way to go. You can not add a bulk floss on them, but they do allow for smaller portions for projects.\u00a0\n\n    Bobbins, $19.56 for 1,000, Amazon.com\u00a0\n\n    Wood Bobbins, $12.00, Sugar Cookie\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 03 of 06\n\n    Organizing Patterns\n\n    Kimberly Ouimet\n\n    \u00a0Organizing your cross stitch patterns can take a bit of time, but it will help you in the long run. Especially if you buy a bunch of patterns at once and plan on using them the whole year through. One of the easiest ways to organize patterns is to use page protectors and binder notebooks. You can organize even more by labeling the binders with themes. If you are particular to animals, have an animal binder, or a people binder. Creating binder themes will make finding a pattern easier. If binders aren't your thing, you can organize your patterns with file folders and a filing cabinet.\u00a0 Kimberly Ouimet's printable organizer is perfect for keeping all of your projects in order. All you need is a binder!\u00a0\n\n    Needlework Printable, $4.00, Kimberly Ouimet\n\n  \u2022 04 of 06\n\n    Organizing Fabric\n\n    Design Mom\n\n    The biggest challenge of organizing your fabric is folding and making sure it continues to stay neat. One way to make sure your Aida and linens are kept nice and clean is to fold them on foam board and stack them like you would a book. They will fit perfectly in a bookcase with the foam board. If you are worried about creases in your fabric. Why not roll your cloth and stack in a bin? This will keep the fabric from creasing and still keep your craft room clean. Both Design Mom and Smashed Peas and Carrots have brilliant ideas on how to keep your fabric organized. Get creative with your storage!\u00a0\n\n    Continue to 5 of 6 below.\n  \u2022 05 of 06\n\n\n    A Needle Runs Through It\n\n    \u00a0One of the most important items to kee\u00a0organized are your needles. Many cross stitchers know that the arm of your couch is not a good place to keep your needles. If you have pets, losing a needle can be a scary thing. Needleminders keep track of your needles, not only when you are working on a project, but also when you are finished . They have become so popular that they are now considered a collector's item. No matter what you are into, there is a needleminder out there for you.\u00a0\n\n    Needleminder, various prices, Etsy\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 06 of 06\n\n    Cross Stitch Travel Bag\n\n    Toteworthy Designs\n\n    \u00a0One great thing about cross stitch is that you can take your projects anywhere. You can stitch in a coffee shop, on the bus or in a park. The only issue is carrying around your supplies. You need a tote that can handle your hoops, your floss and any other accessories you like to have on hand. Any tote will work but there are special ones that are specific to cross stitch and other needlework. Toteworthy Designs has taken the totebag to another level with their version of a customize cross stitch tote. They come in a variety of fabrics, or you can order one specifically made for you.\u00a0\n\n    Cross Stitch Tote, $20.00, Toteworthy Desgins\n\n\nGetting and staying organized doesn't have to cost you a lot of money or be a lot of work. Once you have everything in place you will have more time to craft and less time finding your supplies.",

That wall has been very empty and needing something to make it look more inviting. I ordered this product on July 14, and received it July 28. I was impressed immediately by the thickness of the decal it does not look like a sticker, but more like a carving that has been placed on the wall. Secondly the shine and smoothness of the pieces is amazing quality, and gives a nice look to the overall appearance. It should be noted that the decal is several hundred pieces, but it comes with a template to and numbered pieces to show you where to pace them.

Otherwise, you can further secure with the mainstream 3m wall adhesive, etc.\nThere's a certain ethereal feel to attics because of the unique architectural lines.
