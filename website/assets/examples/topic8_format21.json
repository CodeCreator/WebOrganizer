        "text":"How to be your own unique self \u2013 A style interview with Shelley\n\nby Sylvia\n\nPost image for How to be your own unique self \u2013 A style interview with Shelley\n\nI love women that have a truly unique and arty sense of style who\u00a0are not afraid to stand out. Shelley certainly fits that category with her unusual unique hairstyle taking center stage and she has never felt better. Let\u2019s find out more about her!\n\nCan you tell us a little bit more about yourself?\n\nI was the only child of two working parents, and learned to be independent, resourceful, and to entertain myself from a very early age. Spending a lot of time alone fostered a love of solitary pursuits like drawing, reading, photography and watching old movies, and I still enjoy doing those things today. After moving from a small town to a larger city to attend university, I spent several years of working in record stores (remember those?) and other retail and contract jobs. I found a \u201creal job\u201d, and work as a program assistant at a University in London, Ontario, which allows me to indulge in passions such as travelling and thrift shopping. I have no kids, but I have two smart and adorable pet rats. My current goals are to keep my wardrobe from taking over my too-small apartment, and meet as many of my blogger friends as possible.\n\n\nAs a point of reference which age group do you belong to or perhaps you are willing to share your age?\n\nI\u2019m 53 \u2013 a middle-aged tween, according to my pal Melanie of Bag and a Beret\n\nCan you tell us a bit more about your blog Forest City Fashionista and why you created it?\n\nI\u2019ve always noticed other people who have unique personal style, and when I first saw Scott Schuman\u2019s blog,The Sartorialist, I was inspired to do something similar for the city I live in. My blog began as a way of documenting the small population of creative and stylish people in London, Ontario. Eventually, I found I was shooting the same people over and over, and I was asked why I didn\u2019t photograph my own outfits. Over the last 5 years, my blog has evolved into a photographic diary of the outfits and adventures of a 50-something round peg living in a square hole.\n\n\nHow would you describe your own style?\n\nI would use words like playful, funky, and quirky to describe my style. I\u2019ve loved secondhand shopping for most of my adult life and most of my current wardrobe is from thrift stores. I do very little retail shopping for clothing, but when I do buy something new it tends to be black with an interesting shape and then I wear it with something vintage and brightly-coloured. I\u2019m not very girly, although I do enjoy wearing full skirts with crinolines once in a while.\n\nWhat would you consider the most important components of your style?\n\nMy hair is probably my most recognizable component of my style \u2013 shaved back and sides, with a long section on top that is coloured orange and pink at the moment. Pretty much everyone that reads my blog recognizes me from my hair. My footwear is also important to me because I walk a lot, and can\u2019t wear heels because of foot issues, so I almost always wear boots, Doc Martens, or Converse sneakers.\n\n\nWhere do you live and how does that influence your style?\n\nI have lived the last 35 years of my life in London, Ontario, a city of close to 400,000 people, known for being the home of Western University, and a lot of insurance and law firms. I don\u2019t think that this city has influenced my style, rather, I tend to stand out in this city because of its conservative nature.\n\nDo you feel you have a signature style?\n\nAccording to the people I work with, my signature style tends to be \u201cstuff that other women my age couldn\u2019t get away with\u201d. I guess my hair and footwear would be part of my signature style, and I am drawn to exaggerated proportions (big shoulders in jackets, wide-leg pants, etc.)\n\n\nWhat inspires your outfit choices the most?\n\nMy mood, the weather, and what I\u2019m doing that day, not necessarily in that order\n\nDo you take things like color profiling or body type into account when you dress?\n\nNot that I\u2019m consciously aware of.\n\n\nHas your style changed at all after turning 40?\n\nMy style became more professional and a bit more conservative when I got a full-time office job in my late 30\u2019s and continued into my 40\u2019s. Now that I have been in my current job for 10 years, I\u2019ve found I can wear pretty much whatever I want to work as long as it\u2019s clean and not too short or low cut, so I\u2019ve felt free to experiment more in the last few years with different colours and shapes in my wardrobe. I did notice that I started wearing more colour in the last ten years, which could indicate that I\u2019m mellowing out a little. My body shape has changed over the last 5 or so years which has meant that some things I wore 10 years ago don\u2019t work on the body I have today.\n\nDo you believe in dressing \u2018age appropriately\u2019 and what does it mean to you?\n\nI\u2019ve always worn what I liked, and what I felt good in at that particular time, so I\u2019ve never given much thought to whether what I wore was \u201cage-appropriate\u201d. When style magazines would do those features on how to wear a particular trend at 20, 30, 40, 50 etc. I would often find the version suggested for the 20 year old appealed to me more than the boring one for the 50 year old. I have my own ideas of what I feel comfortable in, and what is appropriate for me, depending on my current body shape, so that is the yardstick I use rather than any societal rules regarding age-appropriateness.\n\n\nWould you say that at this stage of your life you are now more, or less interested in fashion, style and the way you look?\n\nI would say that I\u2019ve always been interested in fashion and style, even as a child when I was mesmerized by the outfits worn by Cher and Carol Burnett on television. I didn\u2019t really know what kind of look suited me best until I was into my 40\u2019s, and I guess at this stage of my life I am less interested in fashion than I used to be, but more interested in whether the way I present myself through my personal style reflects who I am on the inside.\n\nWhy is the way you look important to you?\n\nHow I look (by that, I\u2019m referring to hair style, clothing and accessories) is important to me because my body is my canvas. I have always loved the arts \u2013 theatre, dance, film, visual arts, etc., and wanted to be an artist when I was a child, but I learned that I am not particularly talented in any of those fields, (although I am a good photographer), so what I choose to put on my body every day is my means of creative expression. I want to present my best possible self to the world, but also, a self that reflects my interest in colour, shape, texture, etc.\n\n\nWhich of the outfits on your blog are personal favorites and why?\n\nI can\u2019t think of any in particular \u2013 if it\u2019s on the blog, it means I like something about the outfit and I feel good in it.\n\nDo you follow trends? And if yes, which trends excite you at the moment?\n\nWhen I was younger I would buy fashion magazines every month to see the latest trends, and occasionally incorporate them into my wardrobe, but I stopped doing that about 10 years ago. I still buy the occasional Vogue to look at the beautiful, unattainable fantasy clothes, but I no longer pay attention to what is \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d in a particular season.\n\n\nDo you have any fashion and style tips for women over 40?\n\nI don\u2019t think I am in any position to give fashion or style tips as my style is very specific to me and my lifestyle. The only thing I would say is that being over 40 doesn\u2019t mean you have to \u201ctone it down\u201d or start dressing to suit someone else\u2019s idea of what women of a certain age are supposed to look like. I feel much more liberated in my style choices now than I did when I was in my 30\u2019s because I really don\u2019t give a f@*#k what anyone else thinks about what I\u2019m wearing, and I feel much more comfortable in my own skin.\n\nLife is too short to wear boring clothes.\n\n(I have no idea where this quote originated, but it has become my mantra).\n\nWhat are your plans for your blog and how do you see it develop over the coming years?\n\nI\u2019ve never had a particular plan for my blog \u2013 it has evolved over the years from its beginning as a street style blog, but it has been a natural evolution, not one that was mapped out. It gets more difficult as the years go by (I will have been blogging as The Forest City Fashionista for five years in April) to find the time and ideas for blog posts, and I have reduced the frequency of my posts to once a week. I\u2019m open to seeing where the blog goes, and to keep it going as long as I enjoy it, and believe that I am providing something that is enjoyable for my readers.\n\n\nAnything further you would like to add?\n\nBlogging has been the catalyst for developing cherished friendships with like-minded women all over the world, which I had no idea would happen when I started Forest City Fashionista.\n\nThe other surprising benefit is that I am much more accepting of myself. I used to hate looking at photos of myself because of my crooked teeth, glasses, etc. and I\u2019m much less critical of myself since I started to regularly put myself out there into the world via my blog, where I\u2019m open to the judgement and criticism of others.\n\nI think blogging is a perfect way for women over 40 to connect with each other and the world at large, and show we have intelligent and interesting things to say, are endlessly creative, inspired and inspiring, and have fabulously diverse style! Many thanks to Sylvia for the opportunity to add my two cents to your interview series.\n\nCheck out more of her fabulous style at her blog Forest Style Fashionista. You can also find her on Instagram.\n\n\nP.S. Shelley is one of the bloggers who will join the 40+bloggers meetup in Vancouver in July. I will be there too! If you like to join us, register here.\n\nI will also be in New York and am organising another blogger meetup there.

        "text":"What is Old Is New Again with New Wash by Hairstory\n\nHairstory products\n\nMy twin Kali told me about a new shampoo, New Wash by Hairstory, that is stripped of detergents and that left her hair with amazing curls, so I reached out to the company immediately.\n\nI\u2019m always on the hunt for hair products that will leave my curls looking picture perfect. New Wash is the bomb.\u00a0 Yes, repeat, New Wash is the bomb. It\u2019s a little awkward at first because you want your hair to lather and create suds, but it doesn\u2019t, and that is OK. You have to have faith that your hair will look great sans the suds. My curls were fresh and had no frizz after I washed with New Wash and used Hair Balm.\n\nWes Sharpton, creative director\/hair stylist behind the line, answered my questions about this magical product.\n\nTell me about Hairstory and why it was created.\n\nHairstory is really based on a simple concept: That you could have a excellent product without being excessive about it, \u00a0i.e., less is more. We wanted to focus in on making products that were really, really great. Fewer products that would perform and actually do what they say they\u2019re going to do instead of creating a ton of mediocre ones.\n\nI had a hard time figuring out the right amount to put in my hair because it wasn\u2019t lathering.\u00a0 What\u2019s the best advice you can give newbies when using your product? How much is too little and how much is too much?\n\nThere is a bit of a learning curve in the beginning, and how much product you need to use really does depend on your hair type and texture. I like to say \u201cpumps are personal,\u201d and all hair types will have a different journey with the amount they use. However, what I would recommend to everyone when stepping away from shampoo and making the switch to New Wash is to make sure that the product has contact all over your scalp, if it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not going to grab on to all the dirt and impurities it needs to remove. There really isn\u2019t a magic number of pumps, but I would generally suggest being more generous with product in the beginning if you\u2019re unclear. Then just be sure to rinse really well and repeat for the first few weeks.\n\nHow often should someone use New Wash for cleansing?\n\nWhat you\u2019re doing in switching to New Wash really is replacing your shampoo and conditioner (and your masque and your detangler), so I suggest sticking to the same regimen that you normally follow. If you\u2019re a person who likes to work out really hard and heavy and likes to shampoo your hair every day, go for it, because New Wash is very gentle it\u2019s going to be fine.\n\nIf you\u2019re a person who likes to shampoo it once a week, then stick to that. Your routine doesn\u2019t need to change. What most people will find is that, about a month in, your scalp will rebalance itself. What does this mean? Well, you\u2019ve changed not only your hair routine, but you\u2019ve also changed your skin routine because your scalp is an extension of your skin, and any time you change that you want to be aware of what\u2019s happening to that ecosystem.\n\nI\u2019d suggest that after your first month, when your scalp rebalances, that you pay attention to how it feels. Before making the switch, you may have felt that you had to wash your hair every day, whereas now, you now may find that you gain a day or two and feel compelled to wash less.\n\nWhat should someone do on day two (days I don\u2019t wash my hair)? I was experimenting with undressed and the hair balm. I\u2019m sure you can offer some tips.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a little more volume, maybe your hair fell a little flat during sleep, or you just want to reactivate the root, I love spraying a little bit of our Undressed right at the root. It will bring a little bit of that volume back to life.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to calm your hair down, say you have curly or wavy hair that needs to be a little more tamed, then I would go through and apply a little bit of our Hair Balm from mid-shaft to ends. This will take down any little bit of frizz and seal the ends together.\n\nAvailable at www.shophairstory.com.\n\n0 I like it\n0 I don't like it\n\nEva Marie is a daughter of a hair stylist who from an early age was obsessed with fashion, colors and rubbing sample parfume scents from magazines all over her body.

        "text":"Marc Chaya_President and Co-creator MFK.png\n\nMarc Chaya\n\nLast month, Thailand Tatler had the chance to sit down with the CEO and co-creator\u00a0of world-class Parisian fragrance label Maison Francis Kurkdjian for an interview as the brand held its official launch in Thailand at the pristine Central Embassy.\n\nThe passionate co-founder came with a lot of enthusiasm but also candid insight into what he describes as a sort of misguided market for luxury products like perfumes and the change he would like to drive in the industry through the maison.\n\nAs Maison Francis Kurkdjian turns 10 next year, Marc Chaya met his business and creative partner Francis Kurkdjian by chance 15 years ago when Marc was still working as a bigtime financier at the prestigious Ernst & Young.\n\n\u201cI asked him very casually \u2018what do you do\u2019 and this is when I learned that he was the person behind some of the most groundbreak creations, bestsellers in the fragrance industry.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Marc says, despite Francis\u2019 accomplishments, he did not know the man. Despite even owning several of the perfumer\u2019s works, he did not know his name.\n\n\u201cI was in shock.\u201d\n\nThe encounter made Marc realise that the fragrance industry was the only creative industry in which the talent can be unnamed and unheard of. Because in the world of fashion, for instance, the designer behind every luxury fashion house is well known to the public. When it comes to perfumes however, \u201cthe perfumer tends to be hidden.\u201d The CEO adds, \u201csometimes I\u2019m shocked to read that some people would claim to be perfumers. They are really makeup artists, celebrities or marketeers. This doesn\u2019t happen in any other form of creativity. This isn\u2019t allowed. You cannot write a book and pretend someone else wrote it.\u201d\n\nMarc Chaya_President and Co-creator MFK1.png\n\nThus sparked a total life and career change for Marc (and most likely Francis as well).\n\n\u201cWhen I met Francis I was completely seduced by him and his talent and his know-how. And over time we became close friends and we decided to start working on putting the framework to create a luxury fragrance house that carries his name and that would enable him, as one of the greatest living perfumers of all time, to express his vision freely.\u201d\n\nBesides the mission of putting the artist at the forefront of the brand, the two also identified a decline in luxury that they wanted to repair.\n\n\u201cLuxury was being overused. You could buy luxury watch for five dollars, rent a luxury condominium for 200 dollars. You can even go to the supermarket and buy luxury soap for one dollar. Luxury doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore.\u201d\n\n\nBaccarat Rouge 540 Extrait de Parfum by Maison Francis Kurkdjian\n\n\nBaccarat Rouge 540 Eau de Parfum\u00a0by Maison Francis Kurkdjian\n\nHe goes on to describe the scenario of burly bodyguards sitting intimidatingly at the doors of luxury stores, watching you as if you\u2019re going to do something wrong. At some stage, luxury has become a \u201cvery ostentatious and very intimidating\u201d experience, says Marc.\n\nWhat is Maison Francis Kurkdjian vision for luxury then?\n\n\u201cOne day, Francis showed me a party of a very beautiful movie\u2014Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s with Audrey Hepburn. They go into Tiffany\u2019s and for five dollar she wanted to buy something. This is a store where you can buy a diamond necklace for 10 million dollars, but she still manages to get something, like a small engraving on her ring, for five dollars.\u201d\n\nbreakfast at tiffanys.jpg\n\nAudrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961)\n\nFor Marc and Francis, the vision is for the maison to be true to the perfumer\u2019s craft and creativity, to build the business aspect of the brand around the creativity and to attract and invite those who share the same passion and taste.\n\n\u201cI never think who is my targeted audience. What I think is \u2018what is it that I want to say? What is it that I want to express?\u2019 And what I want to express is a total freedom of creativity for Francis, who to me is genius perfumer, and a total form of non-ambiguous luxury. I think our customers are people who are tired of mass market perfumes, who want to experience quality, who want to experience creativity and who are attracted to the talent of the perfumer, as opposed to the talent of marketing.\u201d\n\nBesides this creativity comes first and marketing second policy, customer experience, says Marc, is also at the heart of the brand--which explains why the maison keeps a considerably low or fashionably quiet profile with limited, though not invisible, online presence.\n\n\u201cI think when you come to our store, you can spend five minutes or you can spend one hour if you have time and want to learn about every scent, the inspiration behind them, where the idea came to Francis, why that name, what are the ingredients and the origins of the ingredients.\u201d\n\n\nSome of Maison Francis Kurkdjian's best-selling scents, including Aqua Universalis and Aqua Vitae\u00a0\n\nThe work dynamic between the two founders seems to be one of trust and integrity towards the art. Marc explains that Francis freely comes up with the ideas, names and scents while Marc helps with testing the scent and giving him feedback that he is free to take or not. \u201cIt happens that he listens to me,\u201d say Marc with a smile.\n\nOnce Francis settles on the scent, it\u2019s then Marc\u2019s turn to develop the strategy of marketing\u2014under Francis\u2019 influence\u2014and in the middle they meet to design the packaging together.\n\nAs the brand is now working on its 2020 line (the maison has already wrapped 2019), as well as a coffee table book to celebrate Francis\u2019 25th year as a perfumer in 2019 and a few other projects, when asked about what the maison\u2019s long term goals are, Marc says,\n\n\u201cI like, in the very humble way, to see ourselves as trendsetters...and I like to be number one.\u201d\n\nFind Maison Francis Kurkdjian at the Atelier De Prestige in The EmQuartier and at Siam Paragon.\n\nTags: Perfume, Fragrance, CEO, Marc Chaya, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, Perfumer, Francis Kurkdjian, Perfume, Luxury",

        "text":"If you asked Rachel Marie Hurst a year ago if she would be showing at New York Fashion Week, she wouldn\u2019t have believed you. But that\u2019s not to say she never dreamed about it. The Denver designer has worked diligently on her craft for years, making a name for herself locally, but never experiencing that breakthrough moment so many designers yearn for. Then, in January,\u00a0 Hurst received a career-changing call.\n\nHurst, whose brand is called Fashion House of Rae Marie, was one of four regional designers chosen by Diet Pepsi to showcase three outfits at New York Fashion Week\u2019s kick-off event, \u2018Style Studio\u2019\u00a0fashion show presented by\u00a0Simon Doonan. The other designers included Genoveva Christoff from Columbus, OH, Elise Bergman from Chicago, IL and Shirin Askari from Dallas, TX. Each designer portrayed their hometown perspective with Doonan (Barney\u2019s Creative Ambassador-at-Large) serving as a mentor.\n\nNew York Fashion Week wrapped up last week, but Hurst\u2019s dreams did not end at that stroke of midnight. She has returned home, but is more focused on fashion than ever. She took the time to answer some of 303\u2019s questions about her experience, who made her starstruck and what\u2019s next for the Fashion House of Rae Marie.\n\n303: You were selected by Diet Pepsi to showcase three outfits during New York Fashion Week. How did it feel to be chosen out of hundreds around the country?\nThis opportunity was so surreal. It was such a dream come true! If you had asked me at the beginning of January if I thought I would be showing pieces at New York Fashion Week this year, I would have laughed and said only in my dreams! But, it was such a humbling learning experience. I feel so blessed and so excited!\nOnce you arrived in New York, what was your schedule like?\nIt was a little crazy since I still had some sewing to finish. All four of the Style Studio Fashion Show participants flew into New York on Tuesday night. We had fittings all day Wednesday with models from Wilhelmina New York. The models were stunning. On Thursday, we had dress rehearsal, hair and make-up and then the show was at 8pm sharp. Following the show, we had interviews. We also met Christian Cota on Thursday. Friday we had more interviews. Saturday we attended Christian Cota\u2019s show. It was crazy, but so amazing!\n\n303: Do you feel like you were able to communicate the \u201cColorado girl\u201d in the designs you presented?\nRH: I think the \u201cColorado girl\u201d is a girl who takes risks and walks to her own tune, and who has clothing that is cross seasonal, fun, funky and colorful. I think I captured the essence and then put my own flare into it.\n303: Tell us a little about your experience at New York Fashion Week. Who did you meet? Where did you go? What did you see?\nRH: I met Simon Doonan and he was fantastic and so down to earth. I also met Christian Cota who was charming and his collection was inspirational and beautiful! The people at Harrison & Shriftman were amazing! Being in the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week tents was beyond what I was expecting. I saw Coco Rocha and was just star struck! She is beautiful in person!\n303: There were several celebrities at the \u201cDiet Pepsi Style Studio\u201d fashion show where you presented, including Mary-Kate Olsen, Debra Messing and Kristin Chenowet. Were you starstruck by anyone in particular?\nRH: I think I was most starstruck by Mary Kate Olsen! I remember growing up and watching her , so I was shocked that she was sitting front row at the show! But I also love Debra Messing, Kristin Chenowet and Kelly Rutherford from Gossip Girl. It was all was so awesome!\n303: How do you think this entire experience will influence your designs and approach to the business?\nRH: I came back thinking, man I have a lot of work to do! I love New York, but it is on a whole different level and the resources for designers there made me a little envious. I really took the advice that was given to me and will be working to further propel my career as a designer.\n303: Simon Doonan is a New York fashion icon. How was it working with such a strong visionary?\nRH: He is AMAZING \u2013 so down to earth, genuine and sweet. He really made time to talk to each designer individually and gave invaluable advice to help us further our careers. I am so grateful.\n303: What did you take away from this experience?\nRH: I took everything away that I could, but mostly to be true to who I am as a designer and stop trying to please everyone. Not everyone is going to like me or what I design and I have to accept that. I have to keep my voice clear and make sure it is what I believe in.\n303: Tell us a bit about your aesthetic and the type of woman you design for.\nRH: I design for a client that is sexy, edgy and chic. My girl isn\u2019t afraid to stand out in the crowd and loves to take risks and be noticed for her fashion in a classy way. I would love to dress Blake Lively. I just think she would be my ideal customer.\n303: What is next for the Fashion House of Rae Marie?\nRH: Well, I am revamping my name, brand and image. I received a lot of great feedback, but I know I have a lot of work to do. I want to push my designs into more boutiques, work on my plus-size line and really design away!\u00a0I am so excited to find out what is next.\n*Images courtesy of Rachel Hurst and Diet Pepsi.",

        "text":"Revolution through Evolution\n\nMosh: The Blue-Sky Thinker!\n\nTextbook hoader-Photographer-Traveller-Fashionista-Blogger, Shalini is an affable social butterfly.\n\nBorn in Cuttack, Odisha, Shalini has grown up moving places! She did her High School\u00a0 from Singapore on an academic scholarship; Bachelors from Raffles International College, Hong Kong and Raffles Design International, Mumbai and currently pursuing her Masters in Fashion Styling and Visual Merchandising, Milan on a scholarship awarded by Vogue Italia Talents.\n\nIn conversation with Mosh, the MbyMosh blogger, let us discover more about this omniscient soul!\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s the story behind M by Mosh\u00a0?\u00a0\n\nMosh is a mash up of my name, Mohanty Shalini. It started with a college project during my Bachelors and from there on I find a strong connection with the name. M used to be Metamorphoshiz (a play on the word metamorphosis, as I was heavily into DIY back then).\u00a0\n\nHow do you envision the future of your blog?\n\nI had changed Metamorphoshiz to M because it was a mouthful to be honest. I intend to (hopefully) one day turn it into a brand. And M will be that brand. M encapsulates everything that I do as a blogger, stylist, graphic designer, etc. M means the world to me.\u00a0\n\nWhen did you discover this inclination (towards fashion)? Was it everything that you had ever dreamt since childhood?\n\nYes, fashion is pretty much a childhood affliction. The back of my exam question papers were filled with doodles of beautiful dresses with sweetheart necklines. But consciously and actively I was preparing for medical school. It was actually my dad who suggested after my 12th grade that I give up on the \u201cnonsensical chase\u201d after medical schools and pursue fashion indeed. And since then, I have never looked back.\n\nHow did this idea of starting an online blog stem up?\n\nIt was actually the suggestion of a few of my friends. I used to DIY a lot and post pictures of my activities (including the ones with disastrous results) on Facebook and I realised a lot of my friends were actively following that segment and even giving really good feedbacks. That\u2019s when I thought blogging would be a great idea since my ideas would be open for viewing\/trying for a lot more people than just the ones on my friend list. And, this happened to be my first blog post which I wrote back in 2014 January.\u00a0\n\nHow supportive and helpful have your parents been?\n\nHahaha. My father = chill. My mother loves it. She is a creative soul just like me, so she enjoys my creative endeavours as well. On a side note, the way my parents support my natural talents has really helped me nurture my confidence levels. It\u2019s something all parents should take a note of. I\u2019m so glad that I was born to two most understanding and supportive parents.\n\nTell us something about your team?\n\nMy team has got to be the best ever. And I\u2019m being completely unbiased here. Seriously. My team includes (rather included, since I moved to a new country) 4 models and myself. I style them, do hair and make-up when necessary, click them, do the post production of the images, add content and POST it up! The models are charming, popular, and effortless at what they do. They make great muses for my DIYs.\u00a0\n\nHow difficult was it to find such convincingly-promising people to contribute and work with you?\n\nNot very difficult. All my models are outgoing girls with a vibrant attitude to life, and that shows very well every time I work with them. In the beginning (even when some of them didn\u2019t have much\/any experience), they still said yes to this because they were so open to trying something new. Like modelling for a blogger. I\u2019m so glad they all said YES!\u00a0\n\nTell us something about your writing experience in other places\n\nAs for writing in other places, for a period of time, I was a writer for the fashion section of IIM Indore\u2019s student magazine, dishing out \u201cfashion gyaan\u201d on a regular basis.\n\nWe even saw a book review on the site. How does that relate to a fashion blog?\n\nI have started expanding on the topics I cover on my blog, and one of them happens to be Book reviewing. The tagline is \u201cDIY. Fashion. Prattle.\u201d\u00a0I love reading books, and I actively promote the idea of reading. It makes us thinkers, you know? People with a great imagination!\u00a0\n\nYour association as a model has been pretty evident. So, any modelling plans down the line?\n\nI\u2019m genuinely not so sure. I know I love modelling because I know I\u2019m able to convey the essence of the character I play, the product\/fashion style I carry, etc. but I can\u2019t do generic modelling. But if something interesting turns up, I\u2019m definitely up for it.\n\nYou stay abroad. What difference do you find staying and working there as compared to when you were here?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s more inspiration here because I\u2019m surrounded by people who are just as ambitious, enthusiastic and creative as I am. It\u2019s a good environment for me to grow and develop not just as a great professional but even expand my skill set. In India, I met all kinds of people: the ambitious and the non-ambitious. So even my work wasn\u2019t consistently that great. I guess you can say my creativity is directly related to the kind of people I surround myself with.\n\nWhat difficulties did you face during your rookie days for mbymosh?\n\nOh. That would be seeing EVERY DAY how little the blog traffic was. It was disheartening. Because I knew my content was really good, but the Internet doesn\u2019t decide to show your blog on top search results because of quality. Hence, I knew I had to persevere and keep doing what I love and believing in it.\n\nHow has Mosh grown in this journey?\n\nMosh has certainly evolved. I\u2019ve been told recently by a very close friend that I don\u2019t have that childish aura I used to have a year ago (around the time I actively started blogging). The person I was in 2014 and the person I am in 2015 are very different: same principles, but a more dynamic, more confident, more daring personality. \u00a0I\u2019ve been moulded into a person who can face everything and anything, because I know my goal. And that is all I need to know.\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019ve been one conspicuous epitome of hard-work. How do you manage work and other things with equal elan?\n\nYou\u2019re too kind and generous to say that, really. I do work hard, but not relentlessly (unless required). I work smart. I have a friend who once told me\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not how many problems you solve in your life, but the ones you take on.\u201d\n\nI sort of twisted it a little bit and apply it to my work: it doesn\u2019t matter with the quantity of effort you put in, but the quality of effort you put in. But of course, when the time comes for an uphill battle, I\u2019ll give it my all.\u00a0\n\nWhat would be your message to the viewers and advice for the hidden talents like you?\u00a0\n\nOnly that: don\u2019t stay hidden. And to do that, embrace yourself completely (strengths and weaknesses) and be comfortable in your own skin. Have unsurmountable amount of belief and faith in yourself and your abilities. That will give rise to a tremendous amount of confidence; the kind of confidence that no one can compete with. \u00a0\n\n\n\nIshani Mishra\n\nI am a trained vocalist and an Odissi dancer. Albeit I am no preacher of the Indian Classical Art and Culture but I find a divine and spiritual connection which inclines me towards it. Other than this, I am a writer by passion.I hence like to move into reveries and ponder about issues and gather all the musings with my pen. I have a varied taste of writing and thus wish to try my hands on any and every aspect possible. And, my future aspiration is to become a civil servant.",

        "text":"Anya Ayoung-Chee Anya Ayoung-Chee\n\nAs the former Miss Trinidad and Tobago, Anya Ayoung-Chee was already recognized internationally for her beauty. But now the Project Runway Season 9 winner wants the beautiful things she creates to find their way overseas.\n\nThroughout the competition, the designer inspired viewers with her can-do attitude. She decided to pursue her fashion dreams after the tragic death of her brother Pilar. Although she had some local success in the Caribbean for her designs, she took the next step and learned to sew four months before applying for and being cast on Project Runway.\n\nThe Project Runway Season 9 winner is...\n\nAfter being announced the winner Thursday, Ayoung-Chee spoke to about how much more she has to learn, how she doesn't hold a grudge against competitor Joshua McKinley and her plans for the future.\n\nCongratulations! How hard was it to keep your win a secret?\nAnya Ayoung-Chee:\nThank you so much! Sometimes if it were with my best friends, it was difficult. And, oh gosh, everybody asked me on the street and everywhere I went. But I didn't want to spoil it. It's so much more fun to find out in real time, so I'm happy that I didn't give it away.\n\nHow was it then when everyone found out? You had some sort of viewing party?\nYes. I live in New York so I had a party here, and I had one in Trinidad \u2014 I was Skyping with them. Trinidad and Tobago has gone crazy. It's like the World Cup or something. It's crazy and everybody was screaming. It was really overwhelming.\n\nIn the moment, what was going through your mind when you found out you had won?\nI was really shocked. I did not anticipate it, particularly because it was just a few days before that I almost went home because I didn't make the best choices of what to show the judges in the three looks. I was so thrilled to be still in the running, but I did not think I was going to win. So it was a complete shock to me.\n\nWhen you learned that you had won in the finale, you also made a point to thank Heidi Klum for her support. What are your feelings about her part in your success?\nFrom the very beginning, Heidi rallied for me because the other judges were not really interested in letting me be on the cast because of my lack of sewing skills. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have been there; I really believe that. What's nice about her, though, is that she was always fair. Even though she had pushed to have me on the show, when I didn't perform well, she made sure to let me know that. So I really appreciated that she wasn't acting on any favoritism, but she certainly was integral to my being on the cast in the first place.\n\nHow much did you overhaul for that final collection at Fashion Week?\nI pretty much did half of it, so out of 10 pieces I made five the day before. [Laughs] I know it's crazy, but we got to go to Mood as you know, so that really helped. Geez, I don't know what I would have done without that.\n\nHave you come to the conclusion that you can you only produce under pressure?\n: [Laughs] I don't think only, but clearly I'm good at it. I don't know where that comes from, but I think I really do produce better when I'm forced to do it.\n\nDo you think the criticisms that you need to take more lessons as far as technique and study more diverse styles are fair?\nYeah, I don't anticipate making clothes for my customers directly, \u00a0but I do see that having skill will improve my design sensibility and I want to keep on that path. So, I think I'm going to challenge myself continue to learn more techniques. It will only make my designing better. And in order to make it in the international market, I have to have a wider variety. I do feel that having more sewing technique will assist me in designing things, let's say for winter, and outside of the things I'm accustomed to.\n\nThe creative silhouette on the dress inspired by the raven made it a particular favorite. Has anyone requested that you remake it... but with a more practical way of getting in and out of it (instead of sewing a person in and cutting them out)?\n[Laughs] Literally, exactly what you said I've been asked to do that. They want me to put a zipper on it.\n\nJoshua McKinley always seemed so resentful and angry at you and your successes. Was it really as it seemed from watching TV?\nI really do think that because of the editing you only see a fraction of what our relationship was. A lot of the time we were really having a good time, and we were tablemates for a lot of the season. We've since grown in our friendship and we've had very honest conversations at how things went on the show. It's in the past. If at times he was just under pressure and he was feeling nervous about where he was at in the competition, he would say things that, although I agree they were unnecessary, it was just par for the course of the competition I think.\n\nWho was the most entertaining behind the scenes?\n: Oh my God, Viktor Luna by far. He kept us all in stitches the whole time, down to the episode you saw last night. They didn't show a lot of what was going on. We were so tired and he just kept us going because he was almost finished with his collection, so he could just be the jokester the whole time. His comedic timing is on point. He's extremely funny.\n\nWho were you closest with? Is there anyone you keep in contact with?\n: Laura for sure. She and I have become very good friends. She lives in St. Louis, so I don't get to see her very much but we talk all the time. She's an amazing girl.\n\nIs there anything you learned about yourself from watching this show?\nI definitely saw that I was able to remain myself completely and not get caught up in a lot of the drama.\u00a0 I just see now how effective that was. It wasn't intentional, but when I see now how much was being said behind the scenes, I'm just glad I didn't get into that.\n\nCheck out the rest of today's news\n\nThe huge earrings and the bracelets you wore on the show were part of the look too. Will you be offering accessories as part of your fashion line?\nAbsolutely. Like you, I just think an outfit is never complete unless you've styled it properly. I love earrings, I love bracelets, I love rings. I'm super into accessories, and I'm absolutely going into that arena and I think it's very viable commercially because you don't have to do sizes or any of those things.\n\nIn the After the Runway specials, Kimberly Goldson mentioned that she's had many male fans ask her out. Have you had any similar proposals or attention in that arena?\nYou know what's funny, it was only one or two of those, but overall the messages have been much more friendly and platonic. It's been just a lot of love and support and definitely not anything too much on that side of it really. I don't know why, but I'm happy it hasn't gone in that direction.\n\nWhat is the funniest fan response or request you've received?\nHmm, that's a good question. So much of it has been so great in the sense of inspiring people to do ... whatever it is that they've been dreaming to do. ... I've just been overwhelmed by how many people have messaged me about being inspired to sew or whatever it is that they realize now they can do if they try to do it.\n\nHow do they message and contact you? What's your Twitter?\nMy Twitter name is @AnyadeRogue and then on Facebook. That's a bit overwhelmeing,. Between the two, it's been hundreds and hundreds of messages about being inspired to follow their dreams.\n\nHow are you going to celebrate now that the secret is out?\nWell, I really feel like now is when the work really begins because I want to continue in the effort to build my online retail presence and get my line into boutiques and stores in the U.S. I don't know if I'm going to celebrate just yet. I want to see the line progress, and that's going to take a bit of work at this point.\n\nWhat is the next step for you then?\nMy website is on the verge of launching the retail portion. That's really my big fish right away. I'm also starting a microfinance loan program for young creatives in the Caribbean to support the kids who are like I was when I was a teenager, who need that extra boost to follow their dreams in the creative field.\n\nAre you happy that Anya won? Would you purchase any of her designs?",

        "text":"An Interview with Linda Rodin\n\nInterview: Linda Rodin\n\nLinda Rodin is one of the most distinguished stylists in the fashion industry, and her name is becoming equally revered in the beauty market. As a young adult, Rodin modeled in Italy, then returned to New York, where she tried her hand at photography, discovering she was better at dealing with the clothing and styling aspect of the craft. She proceeded to open the first boutique in SoHo (Linda Hopp, in 1979), serve as an editor at Harper\u2019s Bazaar, build a prolific freelance styling career, and, most recently, launch the very successful Olio Lusso face oil and corresponding product line.\n\nPossessing an innate style and natural beauty, Rodin avoids the mess of fleeting fashion trends, but still has her finger on the pulse of what is relevant. She has become her own best spokesperson. A collector of beautiful things, accomplished entrepreneur, and self-admitted aesthete, Rodin graciously agreed to answer a few questions for The Aesthetic\u00a0Post.\n\nThere have been hints at a facial cleanser and hand cream, any updates on the future of the Olio Lusso line?\n\nRodin: The hand and body cream, CREMA, will be available November 15, at all of our retailers, and of course on our e-shop. The facial cleanser is in\u00a0the works, and a perfume too.\n\nYou\u2019ve traveled extensively, but you\u2019re unmistakably New York. From your perspective, what is it about this great place?\n\nRodin: Sometimes I think I take New York, my home town, totally for granted, having lived here all my life. But then when I\u2019m in a taxi from the airport, returning home, and I see the skyline, it\u2019s always like for the first time: NYC \u2013 whew! home at last. What is great is the pace. I move quickly, and for me, of course the familiarity I have here is priceless and a short hand for my daily life. I have been living in the same apartment building for 32 years, and I feel safe and good here. And, of course, there is everything one could ever want, as far as culture and convenience. I do love Rome, as my second city though.\n\nAfter years of styling, and your eye being an extension of your career, where do you stand on the debate of form over function?\n\nRodin: It depends totally on the seriousness of the \u2018form\u2019 over the \u2018function\u2019. I collect many, many different types of things, from shells, to sparkly vintage hat pins, to modern chairs, vases, etcetera. I must admit that I never ever think of function when I buy any of these things. The function is that they make me happy. However, for clothing, I do like to be comfortable, so I\u2019ll put function over form, although I have many things that are both.\n\nIn a material context, because the purpose of The General Aesthete is to feature beautiful, smart design, what are some of your favorite examples of outstanding design?\n\nRodin: In fashion, I love Prada and all that they do. It is beautiful and smart, with a wink to the history of fashion, I love it. I am very old fashioned, and not a fan of new architecture. I would rather be in Rome or Paris or Prague, or any old, beautiful, untouched or renovated or restored city or town, than be in Beijing or Dubai. I love the past, I always have. As far as design, house wares and new great things that are well designed and useful, I will take a close look at. There are extraordinary things out there. I like Muji, all things Japanese, and anything Apple.\n\nOlio Lusso\n\nOlio Lusso at The General Aesthete\n\nThere are 3 comments on this article.\n\n  1. add_filter('jpeg_quality', function($arg){return 100;});\n  2. Like the modern design. I was pleased with the information. Thanks for the brilliant post. add_filter('jpeg_quality', function($arg){return 100;});\n  3. Nice stuff, she seems like the quintessential NYC woman. add_filter('jpeg_quality', function($arg){return 100;});\n\n\u00a9 2017, Aesthetic Post",
