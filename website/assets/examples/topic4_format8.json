        "text":"Any person engaged in graduate study at VCU must enroll each semester in which he\/she is engaged in any form of study at VCU that involves use of university facilities, laboratories\/studios and\/or libraries, or who is supervised by or consults with a faculty member concerning graduate work on a project, work of art, thesis or dissertation.\n\nContinuous enrollment for degree-seeking graduate students\n\nContinuous enrollment \u2013 Pre-candidate\n\nOnce admitted to a degree program, a graduate student is expected to comply with minimum enrollment of one course per 12-month period from the beginning of his\/her program.\n\nContinuous enrollment \u2013 Candidate\n\nA graduate student who has completed course requirements for a degree must register for at least one credit at VCU each fall and spring semester until the degree is awarded. Students must be enrolled during their graduation semester.\n\nRevised 5\/8\/2012\nUniversity Graduate Council\n\nStudent load\n\nStudent load is the total number of credits for which students are enrolled in any semester. Students may be either full-time or part-time, dependent upon program rules. Students who are fully funded as VCU graduate assistants with tuition remission are classified as \u201cfull-time\u201d during any semester in which they enroll for nine or more credits (three during the summer if funded on a 12-month stipend). Departmental requirements vary; therefore, funded students should verify expected course loads with their graduate program directors.\n\nThe maximum number of credits for which students may enroll in any semester without special permission is 15. More than 15 credits is an overload. More than 15 credits may result in increased tuition. Permission to enroll for more than 15 credits may be granted upon the written recommendation of the adviser, through departmental governance procedures, to the dean of the Graduate School.\n\nEach summer course is designed to provide the equivalent of one semester\u2019s work. With careful scheduling, it is possible for students to earn as many as 15 credits during the summer if course work extends over the full summer semester calendar. Permission to enroll for more than 15 credits in the summer semester may be granted upon the written recommendation of the adviser through departmental governing procedures to the dean of the Graduate School.\n\nSummer success is predicted on the academic standard of one credit per week. Six credits in five weeks or nine credits in eight weeks is considered a normal load, but VCU does not permit six credits in four weeks or nine credits in six weeks. Suggested summer scheduling combinations are in the online Schedule of Classes.\n\nGraduate courses are not offered during the winter intersession.\n\nRevised 5\/11\/2010; 5\/10\/2011\nUniversity Graduate Council\n\nChange in registration\n\nOnce students have registered for classes, changes in registration must be made during the add\/drop period. Whenever students make any changes in registration, they should keep copies of their new schedules as verification of the changes. Changes in registration may affect financial aid. Students are advised to consult with a financial aid counselor before making any changes to their enrollment status. See the\u00a0Financing graduate school\u00a0section of the Graduate Bulletin for detailed information.\n\nCancellation of registration\n\nTo cancel registration, students must notify, in writing, the Office of Records and Registration before the end of the add\/drop period, or drop all classes using the Web registration system. Refunds are issued in accordance with procedures described in the\u00a0Financing graduate school\u00a0section of the Graduate Bulletin.\n\nAuditing graduate classes\n\nClass size permitting, students may register for courses on an audit basis. Auditing a course means students enroll in courses, but do not receive academic credit upon completion of the courses. Students who register on an audit basis are subject to attendance regulations of that class and, unless otherwise specified at the discretion of the instructor, are subject to the same course requirements as other students in the class. Students who register on an audit basis may be administratively withdrawn by instructors for a violation of class requirements for audit students, before or after the normal withdrawal deadline as posted on the\u00a0VCU Academic Calendar. Audit students are charged the regular rate of tuition and fees. An audit course is counted as part of a student\u2019s semester load in terms of classification as a full-time student. Courses taken for audit, however, do not satisfy minimum enrollment requirements for students receiving graduate teaching or research assistantships, graduate fellowships or university graduate scholarships.\u00a0Students may register for audit only during add\/drop and late registration periods as a new registration and not as a change from credit to audit. Changes in registration status from audit to credit or from credit to audit will not be approved after the last day of add\/drop registration.\u00a0The grade of AU is not included in the calculation of the GPA.\n\nRevised 5\/11\/2010\nUniversity Graduate Council",

        "text":"Faculty & Staff\n\nAcademic Honesty Statement\n\nLas Positas College Faculty Senate\n\nLas Positas College promotes student success by providing high quality instruction and learning resources. The primary factor in student success, however, is the student's devotion of considerable time and energy to the learning process. A high grade in a Las Positas College course is, therefore, something of which both the college and the student can be proud. It indicates mastery of the material achieved through hard work.\n\nAny form of academic dishonesty, whether cheating or plagiarism, undermines the value of grades for the entire student body and the College as a whole. It is an affront to every student who has labored to achieve success honestly and a threat to the College's reputation for academic excellence. For these reasons, the College does not tolerate any form of academic dishonesty. Any student attempting to gain an unfair advantage in a course will be severely penalized, up to and including suspension from classes. The actions taken against the student will also be permanently entered into the student's record in the case of repeated, flagrant, or serious incidents.\n\nFor purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:\n\nCheating is defined as fraud, deceit, or dishonesty in an academic assignment. It may involve:\n\n  \u2022 Copying or attempting to copy from others during an examination or for an assignment;\n  \u2022 Communicating examination information to, or receiving such information from, another person during an examination;\n  \u2022 Preprogramming a calculator or computer to contain answers or other unauthorized information for examinations;\n  \u2022 Using, attempting to use, or assisting others in using materials that are prohibited or inappropriate in the context of the academic assignment or examination in question, such as: books, Web sites, prepared answers, written notes, or concealed information;\n  \u2022 Allowing others to do one's assignment or a portion of one's assignment or using a commercial term paper service;\n  \u2022 Allowing someone else access to your secure online classroom to complete assignments or portions of assignments;\n  \u2022 Gaining unauthorized access to another student\u2019s online classroom account;\n  \u2022 Altering examination answers after an assignment has been completed or altering recorded grades; and\n  \u2022 Resubmitting a previously written assignment for a new course without the permission of the instructor.\n\nPlagiarism is defined as using another's work (whether printed, electronic, or spoken) without crediting him or her. Whereas cheating is almost always intentional, students sometimes plagiarize accidentally. It is vital, therefore, for students to understand the many different kinds of actions that constitute plagiarism:\n\n  \u2022 Submitting the whole of another's work as one's own (see the definition of \"cheating\" above: this includes submitting another student's paper or a paper obtained from a commercial term paper service as one's own);\n  \u2022 Using the exact wording of a source without putting that wording in quotation marks and citing it;\n  \u2022 Paraphrasing the wording of a source without citing it;\n  \u2022 Inadequately paraphrasing the wording of a source (not only the words, but the sentence structure of the original must be changed);\n  \u2022 Summarizing the ideas of a source without citing it; and\n  \u2022 Overusing the ideas of a source, so that those ideas make up the majority of one's work.\n\nFrom discipline to discipline and course to course, students will find that instructors will sometimes use teaching tools like modeling (in which the student is asked to \"model\" his or her writing after another's) or collaboration (in which students co-write or share ideas for an assignment) that seem very close to plagiarism. In cases like these, the instructor will be very careful to emphasize that the \"use of another's work\" is occurring within the specific parameters of the assignment. Such use should not occur in other contexts or without the supervision and consent of an instructor.\n\nDefinition of plagiarism influenced in part by the academic honesty policies of Ohlone College, Fremont California and Hamilton College, Clinton New York; by \"What is Plagiarism,\" Turnitin.com Oakland: iParadigms, 2003. 10 Feb. 2004 ; and by Robert A.

Introduction\n\nThe Community College of Philadelphia is committed to maintaining an environment of respect and trust consistent with the College\u2019s Mission Statement. In addition, the College is committed to complying with all laws and regulations applicable to it, and the College relies upon its employees to perform their duties in accordance with the College\u2019s policies and procedures. The College\u2019s internal controls and policies and procedures are intended to prevent and detect improper activities. The College encourages good faith reports by College employees and others of observed or suspected misconduct, waste, or noncompliance with law, regulations or College policies.\n\nThis Whistleblower Policy is designed to encourage and enable College employees and others who have good faith serious concerns about misconduct, including violations of law, regulations or College policies and procedures, to report their concerns. This Policy is not intended to supplant existing College policies. Thus, complaints or grievances such as those regarding discrimination or harassment, personnel, employment and labor relations matters, academic matters, and other matters for which the College has specific policies, should continue to be made and addressed in accordance with the policies and procedures applicable to such matters and applicable law.\n\nII. Reporting Misconduct\n\nAny person may report allegations of misconduct. Reports shall focus on facts and should avoid speculation. Reports shall include as much detailed information as possible in order to better facilitate evaluation of the nature, extent and urgency of the investigation. Employees may report allegations of misconduct to their supervisor or other appropriate supervisors\u00a0 in their work area.\n\nEmployees may also make reports internally to the President, General Counsel, Vice President for Business and Finance, Vice President for Academic and Student Success, Chief Information Officer or Internal Auditor. The College recommends that persons who are not employees of the College make reports to the College official whom the reporting person reasonably believes has responsibility over the affected area or holds one of the positions listed above. Anonymous reporting is also permissible, but such reports must include sufficient detailed information to warrant an investigation. Reports also may be made outside the College to appropriate authorities.\n\nIn addition to the methods of report set forth above, any person (identified or anonymous) may make a report of suspected misconduct to the College\u2019s hotline at: 1-888-261-1669 or\n\nA person making a report under this Policy may request that it be handled as confidentially as possible. Although the College will endeavor to handle all such reports in a confidential matter, other obligations and considerations may preclude the College from maintaining confidentiality in all circumstances.\n\nIII. Protection from Retaliation\n\nNo individual who in good faith reports misconduct or suspected misconduct (whether internally or to authorities outside the College) shall suffer retaliation for making such a report. Individuals who believe that they have suffered retaliation may report it by one of the reporting methods identified above. Making a report pursuant to this Policy shall not insulate an individual from personnel or other actions that are warranted based upon performance or other factors and are not caused by making a report under this Policy.",
