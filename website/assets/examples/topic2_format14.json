BOLD-IS accomplished alot in those 14 years: we built lots of great websites and web applications, worked with some outstanding employees and developed long-standing relationships with some awesome clients -- many of them important Kansas City businesses and nonprofit organizations.\n\nThe partners now operate as individual enterprises, teaming up with one another and other consultants (many of them ex-BOLD employees) as needed to work on projects. It's much like a guild of artisans, each with distinct skills, teaming up to put those unique skills to work for one another.\n\nAs the Man In Charge of BOLD's development arm, CommandB (aka Bold Interactive Group... read more about that here), specializes in what I do best:\n\n  \u2022 Content-managed websites, specializing in Drupal\n  \u2022 Server and database administration\n  \u2022 Website\/server hosting\n  \u2022 IT consulting\/support\n  \u2022 Web application development\n  \u2022 Project management\n  \u2022 Technical documentation\n  \u2022 User support\n  \u2022 Snarky one-liners (no extra charge)\n\nWhether or not you're a previous BOLD customer, if you need help with your website, application or any have any other type of support need, feel free to contact me and I'll do my best to take care of you.

Created a minimal testcase without using glibc to demonstrate the socket_send\/recv failure with non-socket fds. Sent the testcase and the patch for review.\n  \u2022 Investigated cp issues with O_NOFOLLOW & O_NOTRANS. Sent a mail to bug-hurd explaining both issues and possible solutions.\n\nJuly 19th - July 25th\n\n  \u2022 Initial SCM_RIGHTS implementation. Seems to work when sending pipes, but fails miserably when sending fds from an open syscall. No idea why yet.\n  \u2022 Fixed memleaks in sendmsg() while implementing SCM_RIGHTS. Patch accepted upstream.\n  \u2022 Had to build glibc thrice because the system crashed and the fs was totally corrupted. I'll build stuff in a separate partition as suggested from now on. Doesn't help. It turns out the issue seems to be with kvm, or at least it's only reproducible for me there. I've switched to VirtualBox and there are no filesystem issues there.\n  \u2022 Addressed comments in the \/dev\/fd\/N patches. Need to test them (when I can build glibc and Hurd without the system crashing).\n\nJuly 14th - July 18th\n\n  \u2022 Catched up with email.\n  \u2022 Prepared a patch to implement getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_TYPE, ...). Patch committed to Hurd.\n  \u2022 Addressed comments in the \/dev\/fd\/N patches and resent them.\n  \u2022 Investigated another glib's unix-fd failure: passing fds over a socket using sendmsg() doesn't dup them. Created a minimal testcase. Prepared a preliminary patch, needs testing and fixing.\n\nMay 26 - July 13th\n\n  \u2022 Copyright assignment on file.\n  \u2022 Studied a lot to finish my BSc.\n  \u2022 Got the linkat patch (Savannah #29655) committed upstream.\n\nMay 19 - May 26\n\nMay 12 - May 19\n\n  \u2022 Read http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/hurd\/hurd-talk.html\n  \u2022 Half read http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/hurd\/hacking-guide\/hhg.html\n  \u2022 Read many Hurd interfaces (fs.defs, auth.defs, fsys.defs, io.defs, password.defs).\n\nMay 5 - May 12\n\n  \u2022 Read http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/hurd\/hurd-paper.html\n  \u2022 Improved the linkat() patch\n  \u2022 Fixed the issues mentioned in bug GNU Savannah bug #28934, but after doing so I realized that wouldn't work well. The only good solution is to pass file_name from execve() to the exec server, so we need new RPCs.\n\nApril 28 - May 5\n\n  \u2022 Submitted a talk proposal on Hurd with Michael Banck for DebConf\n  \u2022 Sent request to assign copyright to the FSF for Hurd\/Mach\/libc\n\nBefore April 28\n\n  \u2022 Investigated the glib's gtester problem and tracked it down: GNU Savannah bug #28934. Prepared a patch but it's not good.\n  \u2022 glib's garray test timeouts on Hurd. The tests passes if the timeout is increased. The current upstream timeout (10s) is quite small (it fails on many Debian builds for some Linux arches). However on Hurd it needs a very big time it seems (like more than 100s). Maybe do an allocation benchmarch?\n  \u2022 Investigated glib's unix-fd test failure: getsockopt() isn't implemented on Hurd. Need to implement it in hurd\/pflocal\/socket.c.\n  \u2022 Investigated coreutils' ln EIEIO, with Samuel's help. linkat() is buggy. Reported as bug 29655. Prepared a patch for it.\n  \u2022 Investigated coreutils' cp EACCES. Test case: 'mkfifo a && cp -R --copy-contents a b'. Problem is that O_NOFOLLOW adds O_NOTRANS.\n\nMidterm Evaluation\n\n\n  \u2022 Assigned copyright to the FSF.\n  \u2022 Read many documentation and source code.\n  \u2022 \/dev\/fd\/N bug fixed\n  \u2022 Prepared a patch for getsockopt()\n  \u2022 Fixed linkat() problems.\n  \u2022 Investigated bug with O_NOFOLLOW & O_NOTRANS (needs more work).\n  \u2022 Investigated a glib test failure (garray). Not a Hurd issue.\n\n\n  \u2022 Studied a lot to finish my BSc. Didn't work on Hurd for a month because of that, so that's why I couldn't make a lot of progress (this was known in advance, although in the end the downtime was a bit larger than expected).\n\n  \u2022 There's no expected downtime from now on.",
