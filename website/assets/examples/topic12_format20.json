No. 290,914, filed Sept. 21, 1972 and entitled \"Effervescent Mouthwash Tablet\" now U.S. Pat. No. 3,772,431, dated Nov. 13, 1973.\nWhat is claimed as the invention is\n\n1. An effervescent mouthwash tablet comprising an effervescent couple consisting of at least one each of a solid pharmaceutically acceptable acid and a solid pharmaceutically acceptable base material, which effervescent couple reacts to produce carbon dioxide when dissolved in water causing effervescence, and an effective amount of strontium ion, zinc ion and mixtures thereof as an astringent-desensitizing agent.\n\n2. The tablet of claim 1 wherein said astringent and desensitizing agent is strontium chloride.\n\n3. The tablet of claim 1 wherein said astringent and desensitizing agent is zinc chloride.\n\n4. An effervescent reaction product produced when the tablet of claim 1 is dissolved in water, said product having a pH of about 5.\n\nThis invention relates to an effervescent tablet, including a Zinc or Strontium Ion which, when dissolved in water produces a solution which makes it uniquely desirable for use as a mouthwash.\n\nThe use of mouthwashes in liquid form is well known and popular. However, for many years, the appropriation of a mouthwash from a dry powder has had appeal because it is freshly made instead of having been contained in a bottle for a long period of time. The application of this principle to an effervescent formula has surprisingly attracted little attention, although offering advantages of freshness, taste and effectiveness, as will be set forth hereinafter.\n\nFurthermore, it has been difficult for a traveler, such as a tourist or a camper, to carry liquid mouthwash with him because of weight, fragility or bulk. Furthermore, shelf space is a problem at the retail outlet or even the home and so the provision of a number of tablets is easily preferable to a pint of liquid or the bulky sizes greater than a pint. Also, a tablet being of powder is not subject to atmospheric changes or temperature changes and would be convenient for use by the airlines or on a ship. The tablet would be useful even where the quality of drinking water is a problem since the formula can be modified to include a water purification chemical.\n\nEffervescent tablets for producing cleaning compositions have been formulated in the past.\n\nThe concept of an effervescent tablet has been previously recognized in U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,450,865, 2,105,690, 2,540,253, 2,985,562, 2,999,293, 3,102,075, 3,105,792, 3,136,692 and 3,653,914. Also to be considered is U.S. Pat. No. 3,518,343 which introduces an anti-microbial substance into the effervescent tablet as well as a special tablet lubricant. It should be noted, however, that each of the prior arts has had as it's primary purpose avoidance of technical difficulties associated with the production and tableting of the effervescent tablet. The primary consideration was not for the development of a useful and acceptable mouthwash tablet, but of a produceable effervescent tablet with mouthwash application. The formulas in each instance produce a sweet, pleasant-tasting, colored mixture, not unlike a soda drink.\n\nHeretofore, astringent-desentizing agents have been regarded as unacceptable because of their apparent insolubility in the presence of a carbonate or bicarbonate. These agents will be later outlined with the solution as presented by the present invention. The lack of said agents in previous effervescent mouthwash tablet formulations is most likely responsible to some degree for the noted absence of a commercially acceptable and practically useful effervescent mouthwash tablet. It is our purpose to produce an effervescent mouthwash tablet which will be not only palatable in appearance and taste, but which will have the dual role of producing an astringent mouthwash effect and desensitizing action, and which form will lend itself ideally and uniquely to the additions as outlined in our claims for long lasting plaque control, decay control, anti-microbial action, breath sweetening, whitening, and water purification.\n\nWithout this basic and necessary astringent-desensitizer, the tablet with all additives will be unappealing and therefore non-useful.\n\nThe effervescent granulation can be selected from formulations well known to those skilled in the art. The composition consists of at least one each of a solid acid and solid basic material which react to produce CO2 when dissolved in water, causing the effervescence. The acid may be an organic such as fumaric, citric, tartaric, etc., or a corresponding anhydride or an inorganic, such as sulfamic or phosphonic acid derivitave as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,325,357. The basic material can be any of the metal carbonate salts such as alkali or alkaline earth carbonates and bicarbonates. Lithium, sodium, calcium carbonates or bicarbonates are examples of such materials. Certain combinations of the acids and bases are preferable to others. In the present invention, the tablet is prepared as follows:\n\nI. Basic Effervescent Granules: Parts by weight ______________________________________ Citric Acid, Hydrous 32.4 Tartaric Acid 50.4 Sodium Bicarbonate 95.4 ______________________________________\n\nTartaric acid and sodium bicarbonate are passed through 40 mesh screen, neither are pre-heated as is usually directed. Materials blended and heated on a water bath in a porcelain evaporating dish. Mixture is stirred as it becomes moist with glass or stainless steel device (temperature about 85\u00b0 C. under dish). Screen through 8 mesh screen and heat to two hours in oven at 40\u00b0 C. When damp granules are dry, push through 16 mesh screen and store over silica gel or equivalent desiccant.\n\nThe astringent-desensitizing agent may be:\n\n1. Tannic Acid and the tanin group.\n\n2. Dilute or weak salts of the metals such as zinc chloride, stannic chloride, strontium chloride, alums, aluminum chloride and acetate.\n\n3. Dilute organic acids such as basic acid. Examples of the foregoing are:\n\n1. Zinc chloride and other zinc ion compounds as disclosed herein.\n\n2. Strontium chloride and other strontium ion compounds as disclosed herein.\n\n3. Thymol\n\n4. Silver nitrate\n\n5. Sodium Carbonate (anhydrous)\n\n6. Trichloroacetic acid\n\n7. procaine hydrochloride\n\n8. Potassium hydroxide\n\n9. Phenol\n\n10. Oil of clove\n\n11. Eugenol\n\n12. Crissote\n\n13. Chlorobutanol\n\n14. Ammoniacal silver nitrate\n\nThe use of strontium chloride in aqueous solution has presented difficulties in the past because the strontium chloride has a very low solubility product in prescence of carbonate and bicarbonate. The resulting precipitation would be undesirable because the insoluble precipitate would undoubtedly be available to function as an astringent-desensitizing agent and there would be further objection from an appearance standpoint.\n\nWith the present invention, it is now possible to maintain the strontium ion and\/or zinc ion or vice versa in aqueous solution at a 2 to 15% by weight concentration through the use of effervescent granulation formula No. 1 that maintains a solution ph of about 5 during the course of carbon dioxide generation. Furthermore, the tablet will dissolve in water in twenty to thirty seconds to produce a clear aqueous solution that has effective astringent and desensitizing properties.\n\nA common dental problem is that of extra sensitive teeth. When the dentin or cementum of the tooth is exposed because of faulty brushing, abrasion, gum diseases, etc., then cold, heat, sour, sweet, or pressure contacts these areas and causes discomfort. In aqueous solution the strontium ion is released. This ion appears to have a strong absorptive affinity for the organic fraction of calcified tissue (dentin and cementum). The higher the organic content the greater the absorption. The strontium ion was shown to be effective in relieving sensitivity by virtue of its apparent biocolloidal binding and blocking actions. The ions penetrate into the dentinal tubules in depth. This is consistent with the hypothesis that as the strontium ion binds with the biocolloidal of the organic matrix, an effective blockade is established to disrupt the transmission of external stimuli to the dental pulp.\n\nFORMULA A1 FORMULA A2 __________________________________________________________________________ Effervescent granulation 1.20 (grams) 1.20 (grams) (61.95%) Granular Mannitol 0.400 0.400 (20.65%) green color 0.002 0.002 (0.10%) Ascorbic Acid 0.100 0.100 (5.16%) Strontium Chloride 0.040 0.100 (5.16%) Sodium Saccharin 0.020 0.020 (1.03%) Sodium Benzoate 0.015 0.015 (0.77%) Peppe...

The goal of this PA is to announce a career development opportunity \nfor new investigators to build a program of translational research in \nneurological disorders under the guidance of an experienced mentor.\n\nThis PA is one of three coordinated programs being released by NINDS to promote \ntranslational research, including \"NINDS Exploratory\/Developmental Projects in \nTranslational Research\" \n(, and \"NINDS Cooperative \nProgram in Translational Research\" \n\n\nThe research project for this award must specifically be in the area of \ntranslational research.  For the purposes of this program translational research \nis defined as the process of applying new ideas, insights, and discoveries \ngenerated through basic scientific inquiry to the treatment or prevention of \nhuman disease.  Projects will typically include either a disease-relevant assay, \nor candidate therapeutics that have a significant effect in a disease model.\n\nThe career development and training experience must focus on translational \nresearch.  This should include the principles of therapeutics, candidate \nscreening and evaluation, assay validation, the development and use of animal \nmodels of neurological disorders, toxicology and safety testing, biostatistics, \nthe preparation of Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device \nExemptions (IDE) applications, and interactions with private sector companies \ninvolved with the manufacture and marketing of therapeutic drugs or devices.  \nAlthough all of these elements will not normally be included in the research \nproject, experience and training in these areas should be built into the career \ndevelopment plan.\n\nThe rapid translation of basic neuroscience research findings into improvements \nin clinical neurology and neurosurgery practice and outcomes remains an \nimportant part of improving the quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and cost-\neffectiveness of health care.  Significant hurdles exist, however, to \nimplementing this goal.  There is broad agreement among researchers and health \ncare providers about the urgent need to accelerate the application of evidence-\nbased findings and tools in clinical practice.  The overall objective of this \nprogram is to attract and encourage investigators at the postdoctoral or early \nfaculty development stage to focus their efforts on translational research in \nneurological disorders.  This program is intended to promote more extensive \ninteraction among basic and clinical researchers, and to accelerate the \ndevelopment of interventions and effective treatments that will improve the \nquality of life of persons with neurological disorders.\n\n\nThis PA will use the NIH Research Scientist Development Award \u2013 Research & \nTraining (K01) mechanism.  Applicants will be solely responsible for planning, \ndirecting, and executing the proposed project.  These awards are intended to \nsupport a period of intensive supervised career development experiences in the \ndevelopment of treatments for neurological disease.  Candidates for the K01 \naward normally will have some postdoctoral research experience at the time of \napplication.  The candidate must be able to demonstrate the need for 3-5 years \nof additional supervised research, and the potential for a highly productive \nindependent career.  K01 Awards are not renewable.\n\n\nYou may submit an application if your institution has any of the following \n\no For-profit or non-profit organizations \no Public or private institutions, such as universities, colleges, hospitals, and \no Units of State and local governments\no Domestic\n\n\nAny individual with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out \nthe proposed research is invited to work with their institution to develop an \napplication for support.  Individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic \ngroups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply \nfor NIH programs.  Candidates for NINDS K01 awards must have a Ph.D. or \nequivalent research-intensive degree (e.g., Pharm.D.) and must have demonstrated \nthe potential for highly productive independent research in the period after the \ndoctorate.  The candidate must identify a mentor(s) with extensive basic and\/or \nclinical research experience.  Candidates must be willing to spend a minimum of \n75 percent of full-time professional effort conducting research and research \ncareer development during the entire award period.  The candidate must clearly \ndescribe the need for intensive research supervision for a period lasting 3-5 \nyears leading to research independence.  Current or past principal investigators \non NINDS\/NIH research grants are not eligible for this award (the only \nexceptions are the R03 and R21 awards).\n\nCandidates must be U.S. citizens or non-citizen nationals, or must have been \nlawfully admitted for permanent residence by the time of award.  Individuals \nadmitted for permanent residence must be able to produce documentation of their \nimmigration status such as an Alien Registration Receipt Card (I-551) or some \nother verification of legal admission as a permanent resident.  Non-citizen \nnationals, although not U.S. citizens, owe permanent allegiance to the U.S.  \nThey are usually born in lands that are not states but are under U.S. \nsovereignty, jurisdiction, or administration.  Individuals on temporary or \nstudent visas are not eligible for this award.\n\n\nA. Environment: The institution must have well-established research and career \ndevelopment programs and qualified faculty in basic and\/or clinical research to \nserve as mentors.  It is particularly desirable that the institutional setting \nbe conducive to translational research and therapy development.  The institution \nmust be able to demonstrate a commitment to research and to the continuing \ndevelopment of the candidate as an independent scientist.  Institutions with \noutstanding basic and clinical neurology researchers who can serve as mentors \nare particularly encouraged to take advantage of these career awards to train \nthe next generation of translational neurological sciences researchers.\n\nB. Program: The award provides up to 5 years of salary and research support.  At \nleast 75 percent of the recipient\"s full-time professional effort must be \ndevoted to the goals of this award.  The remainder may be devoted to other \nscholarly activities and research pursuits consistent with the objectives of the \naward.  In particular, candidates for the K01 award must be able to devote \nsubstantial time and effort to achieve the objectives of the career development \n\nC. Mentor(s): Candidates must name a primary mentor who together with the \napplicant is responsible for the planning, direction, and execution of the \nprogram.  The mentor should be recognized as an accomplished investigator in the \narea of therapy development and have a track record of success in training \nindependent investigators.  The mentor should have sufficient independent \nresearch support to cover the costs of the proposed research project in excess \nof the allowable research costs of this award.  Because of the scope of this \nprogram, candidates may wish to nominate co-mentors that can provide particular \nexpertise which will augment and balance the research strengths of the primary \nmentor.  NINDS strongly encourages outstanding research scientists with \nsignificant basic-clinical (i.e., translational) neurological sciences research \nexperience to serve as mentors or co-mentors.\n\nD. Allowable Costs:\n\n1. Salary: The NINDS will provide salary of up to $85,000 plus fringe benefits \nfor the career award recipient.  The total salary requested is normally based on \na full-time, 12-month staff appointment.  It must be consistent both with the \nestablished salary structure at the institution and with salaries actually \nprovided by the institution from its own funds to other staff members of \nequivalent qualifications, rank, and responsibilities in the department \nconcerned.  If full-time, 12-month salaries are not currently paid to comparable \nstaff members, the salary proposed must be appropriately related to the existing \nsalary structure.\n\nThe institution may supplement the NIH salary contribution up to a level that is \nconsistent with the institution\"s salary scale, however, supplementation may not \nbe from federal funds unless specifically authorized by the federal program from \nwhich such funds are derived.  Because the salary amount provided by this award \nis based on the full-time institutional salary, no other NIH funds may be used \nfor salary supplementation.  Institutional supplementation of salary must not \nrequire extra duties or responsibilities that would interfere with the purpose \nof the K01.  Under NIH grants policy, however, institutions may rebudget funds \nwithin the total costs awarded to cover salaries consistent with the \ninstitution\"s salary scale up to the current legislated maximum salary. \n\n2. Research Development Support: In addition to salary, NINDS will provide up to \n$50,000 in research development support.  These funds may be used for the \nfollowing expenses: (a) tuition, fees, and books related to c... (truncated)",

Several of these demonstrated magnetic field interactions. Fortunately, the devices that exhibited positive magnetic field interactions typically become incorporated securely in tissue within six weeks after implantation due to ingrowth and other mechanisms. Therefore, for most coils, filters, stents and grafts that have been tested, it is unlikely that these implants would become moved or dislodged as a result of exposure to MR systems operating at 1.5-Tesla or less. Additionally, many of these items have been evaluated at 3-Tesla (see below). MRI-related heating may also be of concern for certain configurations or shapes for coils, stents, filters, and vascular grafts. To date, there has been no reported case of excessive heating in association with MRI and these types of implants.\n\nMany coils, filters, stents and grafts are made from nonferromagnetic materials, such as the LGM IVC filter (Vena Tech) used for caval interruption and the Wallstent biliary endoprosthesis (Schneider, Inc.) used for treatment of biliary obstruction. As such, these implants are acceptable for patients undergoing MR procedures relative to the use of the particular field strength utilized in the ex vivo testing (for specific information, see The List). Notably, it is unnecessary to wait after surgery to perform an MR procedure in a patient with a \u201cpassive\u201d metallic implant that is made from a nonmagnetic material (see Guidelines for the Management of the Post-Operative Patient Referred for a Magnetic Resonance Procedure). In fact, there are reports in the peer-reviewed literature that describe placement of vascular stents or other similar devices using MR-guidance at 1.5-Tesla and 3-Tesla. Interestingly, some of these vascular implants (e.g., vascular stent grafts and stainless steel embolization coils) display high magnetic field interactions in association with 1.5- and 3-Tesla MR systems, yet have MR Conditional labeling approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nPatients with the specific coils, stents, filters and vascular grafts indicated in The List have had procedures using MR systems operating at static magnetic field strengths of 3-Tesla or less without reported injuries or other problems.\n\nA study by Taal, et al. (1997) supports the fact that not all stents are safe for patients undergoing MR procedures. This investigation was performed to evaluate potential problems for four different types of stents: the Ultraflex (titanium alloy), the covered Wallstent (Nitinol), the Gianturco stent (Cook), and the modified Gianturco stent (Song) - the last two are made from stainless steel. Taal, et al. reported \u201can appreciable attraction force and torque\u201d found for both types of Gianturco stents. Taal, et al. stated, \u201cthe Gianturco (Cook) stent pulled toward the head with a force of 7 g\u2026however, it is uncertain whether this is a potential risk for dislodgment.\u201d In consideration of these results, the investigators advised, \u201c\u2026specific information on the type of stent is necessary before a magnetic resonance imaging examination is planned.\u201d\n\nMRI at 3-Tesla and Coils, Stents, Filters and Vascular Grafts. Different coils, stents, filters and vascular grafts have been evaluated at 3-Tesla. Of these implants, two displayed magnetic field interactions that exceeded the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International guideline for safety (i.e. the deflection angles were greater than 45 degrees). However, similar to other comparable implants, tissue ingrowth and other mechanims are sufficient to prevent them from posing a substantial risk to a patient or individual in the 3-Tesla MR environment. Please refer to The List for specific information related to coils, stents, filters and vascular grafts.\n\nMRI at 3-Tesla: Bare Metal and Drug Eluting Coronary Stents. Patients with coronary artery disease are often treated by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Re-narrowing at the angioplasty site, or restenosis, occurs in as many as 50% of patients following PTCA. Therefore, after coronary artery intervention, either a bare metal or drug eluting stent may be placed in an effort to prevent restenosis.\n\nMRI information has been obtained for many bare metal and drug eluting coronary artery stents, which have been reported to be acceptable for patients undergoing MR procedures at 3-Tesla or less (i.e. based on assessments of magnetic field interactions and MRI-related heating). Of note is that, for these coronary artery stents, patients may undergo MRI procedures immediately after placement. Please refer to The List for specific information.\n\n\nAhmed S, Shellock FG.
