        "text":"The Advantages of Obtaining Applied Vehicles for Purchase On line\n\nSearching online is a well known and valuable means of locating used vehicles for sale. That is a superb market for car merchants and individual retailers to market their vehicles, and for consumers to see second-hand vehicles minus the inconvenience of traveling round garages and playing revenue pitches. Customers can search cars at leisure from their own houses and have time for you to believe obviously about their decisions alternatively of being rushed into buying in a high pressure situation. Vehicle traders who promote on the web also can reduce overheads, specially in how many sales representatives employed 88\uce74.88\uce74' in 88\uce74 \uc911\uace0\ucc28 |\n\nWhen observing used car income online potential buyers may view images and also mail the automobile dealer or operator with issues concerning the car. That is an infinitely more effective process than having to move and meet anyone to talk about the automobile if you are only at the perusing stage. Needless to say, should you intend to get the automobile from the categorized marketing website, it is vital to meet owner, see and check drive the vehicle, and probably carry along a car technician to check on that everything is in correct functioning order.\n\nSome car sellers offer incentives to customers who search their sites before purchasing from the specific dealership, such as for example providing on line discount. This allows prospective customers to see an automobile dealership\u2019s recent inventory on line and establish if their shop is worth a visit or not. Having consumers who have already examined their used cars on the market on the web significantly reduces the dealer\u2019s time and manpower as well. On the web commercials also provide car sellers significantly higher coverage of the used cars they\u2019re attempting to sell and expands their array of consumers, possibly taking them a lot more business.\n\nYet another significant advantage of the Web when checking second hand cars for sale, is the capacity to obtain a large amount of information in a brief place of time. You can receive a detailed report of the car by publishing the car identification number to Carfax. This may offer you with home elevators the car\u2019s owners, any incidents and any significant technical issues. That equips you with the information required to produce an educated choice therefore you choose the best vehicle for your budget and needs. Obtaining the exact same information offline will take around two weeks.\n\nWith trusted websites that promote used vehicles on the market, there\u2019s no further the requirement to entirely count on the time-consuming way of planning round vehicle retailers and pouring around newspaper advertisements. You need to use on line resources to narrow the search to your preferences of make, model, price, gas type an such like and perform most of your research and communication with owner online. Having gathered a wide range of informative data on the automobile you want to get and different comparable kinds of applied cars also can give you bargaining power. The seller may be aware that you understand a lot about the automobile as well as the worth of related applied cars. Thus, the Net is definitely the best and many effective means of locating applied cars for sale.",

        "text":"\n\nKelley Blue Book \u00ae - 2004 Dodge Stratus Overview\n\nVehicle Overview from Kelley Blue Book\n\nKBB.com 2004 Dodge Stratus Overview\n\nIn the Spirit of Muscle Cars Past\n\nThere was a time not long ago when Dodge built some of the fastest, most desirable performance coupes on the planet. Names such as Charger and Challenger were augmented by such labels as Hemi, shaker and six-pack and sent shivers up and down the spines of car guys from coast to coast. Today, a well-preserved original can fetch up to $40,000 at auction, proving that these cars were a one-of-kind creation never to be replicated. So what's a 21st century car lover to do? Well, though the days of the muscle car have passed, Dodge has not forgotten the spirit of those coupes, the hours of pleasurable cruising they inspired and the powerful image they conveyed. Today's young drivers can capture a bit of the old Dodge magic in the new Stratus coupe.\n\nThe coupe market is a tough place to play. There are fiercely good competitors from both Europe and Japan, and a host of aftermarket companies jockeying for favor among the young street tuner crowd. This is not a place for a warmed-over sedan platform massaged into coupe form; this is a market that demands serious commitment. Understanding this, Dodge has turned to its long-time partner Mitsubishi for a little help. The basis of the Stratus coupe is derived from the excellent Eclipse platform. The engine, drivetrain and interior fittings are all direct transplants, with only the wheelbase and rear end modified by Dodge. Where the Eclipse is really a two person coupe with a tiny backseat, the Stratus' additional length and higher roofline allow it to comfortably carry two full-size adults and still provide plenty of room for their luggage in the deep trunk.\n\nIn the looks department, the Stratus scores big. Its racy wheels, sharply creased sheetmetal and aggressive crosshair grille are definitely shaped to attract the younger eye. Dodge further pushes the sport car envelope by adding on wide, lower side runners and a sharp trunk-mounted rear wing. The Stratus is available in two trims, SXT and R\/T, but unlike most coupes, the base model SXT does not look like a stripped down version of the racy R\/T. We applaud this decision, which allows those who want the look of the R\/T, but not the added power and cost.\n\nThe SXT includes a long list of standard equipment, including 16-inch cast aluminum wheels, remote keyless entry, cruise control, power windows and door locks, power trunk release, tilt-wheel, air conditioning and an AM\/FM stereo cassette with four-disc in-dash CD changer. Prices for the SXT model start at just $20,535 and include a number of options and packages.\n\nThe Stratus' interior is as sporty and clean as its exterior. You'll find the speedometer and tachometer are deeply recessed in a hooded pod that protects them from the sun's glare; R\/T models have white-faced gauges for even better clarity. The Stratus' low-back bucket seats include adjustable headrests and seat height. They provide good lateral and lower back support and can be equipped with a 6-way power driver's seat with manual lumbar support. A wide center console contains two large cup holders and a deep storage area perfect for hiding CD's and cell phones. The shift lever rests exactly where your hand naturally falls and is angled down so as not to block the heater controls.\n\nPower for the SXT comes from a spunky 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces a healthy 147 horsepower. With this engine under its hood, the Stratus feels light on the road, easily maneuverable with a nice balance between front and rear. The suspension set up on the SXT tends to lean toward comfort over performance, but you will still find this sporty coupe offer hours of driving enjoyment combined with a very livable ride. Another bonus for the Stratus is its 16-gallon fuel tank that allows you to cruise an average of over 450 highway miles on a single tank of gas.\n\nFor those who want all the driving excitement promised by the Stratus' muscular exterior, the R\/T model is the one you'll want. It comes standard with a slick shifting five-speed manual transmission and a torque heavy 200-horsepower 3.0-liter V6. You'll find the V6 brings this car to life, with good low-end torque for quick passing and jackrabbit off-the-line starts. Handling is vastly improved over the base model, due in part to the thicker roll bars and stiffer shocks, but mostly because of the tenacious 17-inch Goodyear performance tires. The R\/T also offers the option of Chrysler's AutoStick automatic transmission that allows you the pleasure of selecting your own gears without the burden of operating a clutch pedal. If you decide to go with the AutoStick, you will be offered the added security of low-speed traction control, a worthwhile option for those who drive in snow and rain.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 by Kelley Blue Book Co., All Rights Reserved.",

Can a \u00a375k De Tomaso hold a candle to Lamborghini\u2019s \u00a31m masterpiece. Is a \u00a31m Lamborghini really worth a dozen times more than a De Tomaso? Greg MacLeman unleashes Pantera and Countach in search of the greatest \u201970s supercar. Photography Julian Mackie.\n\nImagine a visitor from another world with no prior knowledge of the intricacies of British politics stumbling across David Miliband standing in the road. Then, drawing alongside, his brother Ed. From a distance the similarities are plain to see, but take a few steps closer and, despite their family resemblance, the two could not be more different. Like screaming and yawning \u2013 only there\u2019s nothing boring about either of these game-changing supercars.\n\nLamborghini Countach LP400 vs. De Tomaso Pantera\n\nLamborghini Countach LP400 vs. De Tomaso Pantera\n\nBy the late 1960s, Lamborghini had taken a comprehensive lead over De Tomaso in the hunt for ever-increasing top speeds. With the Miura, Sant\u2019Agata was the reigning champion, while its rival was reeling from the perceived failure of the incredibly beautiful yet dynamically challenged Mangusta. As a result, it was all to play for at the turn of the next decade.\n\nThe Pantera project began as a marriage of convenience between Argentine-born Alejandro De Tomaso \u2013 who controlled Ghia and Vignale \u2013 and Ford, which desperately required a halo sports car with which to take on the Chevrolet Corvette. The Blue Oval duly offered De Tomaso a plentiful supply of V8s, pledging $2m in financing as well as access to its network of Lincoln-Mercury dealerships. The schedule was tight, though, and when the Tom Tjaarda-penned Pantera went on display at the 1971 New York Auto Show it was far from a finished product.\n\nLamborghini Countach LP400 vs. De Tomaso Pantera\n\nLamborghini Countach LP400 vs. De Tomaso Pantera\n\nEarly examples were plagued by issues ranging from overheating to air-conditioning units devoid of refrigerant, each car needing a considerable number of man-hours to put faults right when it arrived from Modena at Bill Stroppe\u2019s shop in Long Beach, California. Yet despite the questionable quality control and a wary reception from the motoring press, the Pantera was light years ahead of the Mangusta \u2013 thanks in large part to its Giampaolo Dallara-engineered chassis, courtesy of the former Sant\u2019Agata man who had helped to mastermind the Miura.\n\nLamborghini\u2019s task was arguably more challenging: to improve upon the model that had almost single-handedly created the supercar segment and to fend off a resurgent Ferrari, which had its 365GT4 Berlinetta Boxer in the pipeline. Sant\u2019Agata fired its opening salvo at the Geneva Salon in March 1971, where it revealed the extraordinary LP500 concept \u2013 the car that would become the Countach LP400. Perhaps even more than the Pantera, the gestation of the new model was a complicated process that involved a change of tack from the semi-monocoque of the prototype to a tubular spaceframe chassis reminiscent of a Porsche 917, while the longitudinally mounted V12 was reduced in capacity from five litres to four.\n\nThe wedge was king in 1970s car design, but to describe either of these two cars as such would do a great disservice to both Gandini and Tjaarda. The Lamborghini in particular seems to evolve under your gaze, straight lines and angular sharpness giving way to softly sweeping curves. You can almost visualise the pencil swooping over the draughtsman\u2019s table as you trace the undulating outline of the bonnet and the Coke-bottle swage line down each flank.\n\nLamborghini Countach LP400 vs. De Tomaso Pantera\n\nLamborghini Countach LP400 vs. De Tomaso Pantera.\u00a0Angular wedge styling and lurid paintwork place our supercar pairing squarely in the \u201970s, but their pace can still trounce that of many a modern vehicle.\n\nPerhaps Gandini\u2019s greatest triumph was the slashed rear arches that add a sense of motion to the styling, paired with black NACA ducts and the cavernous air scoops that were added to the otherwise largely unchanged LP500 concept. The Countach is a different car from each angle \u2013 from the front, sleek arrowhead; the tail, pure muscle; and from the side, cruise missile \u2013 and in 1974 the wild scissor doors must have seemed like something straight out of a science fiction film. It\u2019s a design that defined a generation of supercars, influencing the visual language of every Lamborghini to leave the factory since. In contrast, the Pantera, perhaps unsurprisingly, boasts a more transatlantic flavour.\n\nLamborghini Countach LP400 road test\n\nLamborghini Countach LP400 road test\n\nWhere the Countach is all-Italian supercar, the De Tomaso has muscle car overtones, with bulging, tall rear tyres akin to a top fuel dragster and a meeting of side window and rear wheelarch that brings to mind \u2013 if you squint hard enough \u2013 Mustang Mach 1 and Buick Skylark.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear that the De Tomaso was built, at least in part, to fend off the Richard Teague-styled AMC AMX\/3 \u2013 although that threat ultimately proved to be empty.\n\nBoth Countach and Pantera share a striking similarity from behind, with each tail slanting aggressively and sharing a flat deck leading to a barely functional vertical rear window. In a rare nod to practicality, \u2018our\u2019 Lamborghini has small door mirrors \u2013 a feature notably absent from the Pantera. In truth, though, regardless of which car you\u2019re driving you might as well have a passenger carrying a red flag should you ever need to reverse. Or, in the case of the Countach, master the art of the \u2018pitlane prowl\u2019 and back up with the driver\u2019s door raised.\n\nLamborghini Countach LP400 road test\n\nLamborghini Countach LP400 road test.\u00a0Clockwise: even today, few cars can match the sheer drama of the Lamborghini; small three-spoke wheel with Raging Bull centre; inlets duct cooling air to vast engine; Campagnolos and period-correct XWXs; V12 was carried over from the Miura, but is mounted longitudinally in Countach.\u00a0From top: Lambo\u2019s cabin is pure theatre with highly stylised seats and vast transmission tunnel; De Tomaso remarkably conventional inside; both cars provide huge drama out on the public road.\n\nIn engineering terms, the Lamborghini is a curious mix of old and new; a cutting-edge lightweight aluminium body draped over a complex spaceframe and mated to a four-litre V12 \u2013 based on that of the Miura \u2013 sitting amidships. Unlike its transverse-engined predecessor, the LP400\u2019s transmission is located ahead of the engine between driver and passenger; power is channelled forward to the gearbox and then back \u2013 via a shaft passing through the sump\u2013 to the differential, and on to each rear wheel. As well as allowing for a remarkably short wheelbase, the layout negates the need for a lengthy gear linkage, resulting in a pure and delightfully mechanical shift.\n\nIn contrast, DeTomaso opted to place the ZF transmission behind the differential, with the engine ahead of the axle line. \u2018Students of race car design will immediately notice that all major components are in the right place,\u2019 noted Road Test\u2019s John Ethridge in period, and in many ways the Pantera proved a spiritual successor to the GT40, proving to be a useful tool in Group 4 racing. Its sub-structure closely matched that of Ford\u2019s Le Mans winner, too, while the drag coefficient was found to be practically identical.\n\nAt its heart, the Pantera boasts the fruit of De Tomaso\u2019s partnership with the Blue Oval \u2013 a thumping 351cu in (5.8-litre) \u2018Cleveland\u2019 V8. If the Lamborghini\u2019s engine is a scalpel, then the Pantera\u2019s is a sledgehammer; the pushrod unit is as simple as they come, but with that simplicity come reliability, tunability and tractability that helped the model to endure.\n\nYou instantly know where you stand when you hear the DeTomaso\u2019s V8 burble, unlike its rival. Any sense of familiarity afforded by the steering being on the correct side of the Countach \u2013 it\u2019s one of only 17 right-hand-drive examples built \u2013 soon evaporates as you lift the bonkers door and slide into the outlandish, high-backed leather seat.\n\nDe Tomaso Pantera road test\n\nDe Tomaso Pantera road test\n\nThough more reserved than that of a Miura, the cabin reeks of Italian style and 1970s flamboyance, complete with an upright driving position and a pedal arrangement that demands careful placing of penny loafers.\n\nTurning the key kicks the fuel pump into action, a series of clicks and whirrs accompanying the priming of six twin-choke sidedraught Webers, the engine bursting into life with a tickle of the throttle. Fly-off handbrake released, the gearlever slots into the dogleg first with ease and you release the clutch pedal, which has a high biting point and long travel. Judicious use of revs prevents stalling, which owner Stephen Ward says can be a problem if you\u2019re not used to the car\u2019s foibles. Newcomers can expect an ungainly and nervous start before they and the Countach become better acquainted \u2013 horse riders will know the sensation well \u2013 but confidence grows with each shift through the stiff, purposeful \u2019box. Being more aggressive with the throttle is rewarded with a V12 roar accompanied by great lungfuls of air and fuel being gulped by the intakes.\n\nShallow wheelarches limit suspension travel, but even on bumpy roads the Countach absorbs imperfections beautifully, cornering flat and encouraging you to press on through long sweepers before burying the throttle to power up approaching hills. Blind crests provide the opportunity to test the brakes, which show their age but haul up the LP400 straight and true.\n\nDe Tomaso Pantera road test\n\nDe Tomaso Pantera road test.\u00a0Clockwise: aggressive wedge profile was the work of American designer Tom Tjaarda; \u2018Cleveland\u2019 V8 is set well forward; stylish Campagnolo alloy ...

        "text":"Does Transit Yield its Promised Economic Benefits? A 1969 Perspective.\n\nJune 25th, 2015\n\nThe actual economic benefits of Metro far exceed what planners estimated in 1969, and it\u2019s worth remembering as we consider future transit investments.\n\nIn the late 1960s, when Metrorail was nearly about to begin construction, Metro published a forecast of the economic benefits of Metrorail. \u00a0The report made rosy projections of the all the travel time and costs the network, then a 97-mile proposed rail system, would bring. \u00a0(It also included photos of the pretty awesome 3-D model of a station, including maybe a one-car train?). \u00a0Now, four decades later, were the projections right? \u00a0Has Metrorail produced the benefits we thought? \u00a0The answer is yes, and then some.\n\n\nCover of a 1969 report estimating the economic benefits of Metrorail\n\nAt the time this report came out, the region was about to make a substantial investment in public transit , probably not unlike today, where we face real choices about whether to invest in Metro 2025 initiatives such as 8-car trains, the Purple Line, or bus lanes. \u00a0To quote the report,\n\nMetro is ready for construction. The routes have been selected. The program for local financing has been approved.\n\nHow feasible is Metro? Who will benefit? \u00a0Will the benefits justify the costs? Is Metro a good public investment for the National Capital Region and its financial partner, the federal government?\n\nThe report tallied up all the time savings to riders \u2013 former motorists, former bus riders, and truckers \u2013 as well as the travel cost savings like avoided parking, vehicle savings, operating cost savings, and more. \u00a0It concluded that Metro would save $186 million per year in 1990$, roughly equivalent to $310 million\/year in today\u2019s dollars after adjusting for inflation.\u00a0\n\n\nThe economic benefits of Metro today exceed what was forecast in 1969.\n\nDid this turn out to be correct? Our 2011 Making the Case for Metro study posed a very similar question, and estimated the same economic benefits of Metro (travel time, costs) in 2011 at just over $1 billion\/year \u2013 about three times higher than the estimate from the 60s. \u00a0There are some apples-to-oranges going on here, most notably that the 1969 study quantified the benefits of Metrorail alone, whereas the 2011 study included Metrobus. And Metrorail in 2011 was a bit bigger than 97 miles. But nevertheless, the current benefits still outweigh the 1969 study. \u00a0Interestingly, the study also predicted that the cost of Metrorail would be just under $1 billion (in 1969 dollars) \u2013 significantly less than the actual construction costs, but the difference in costs is roughly similar to the difference in benefits.\n\nIn 1969, \u201c30% of downtown-destined commuters travel by public transportation. This is unique for a city without rail transit.\u201d \u00a0Today, with Metrorail, that share is up to 51% according to COG\/TPB Cordon Counts (PDF), even as the city has grown significantly.\n\nForty years ago, this region was considering a massive investment in transit, and the actual benefits have exceeded the forecasts at the time. \u00a0As we consider the costs and benefits of further transit investments, it is important to keep this in mind.\n\n\nPages from the 1969 report (click for larger)\n\nPages (click for larger)\n\nPages from the 1969 report (click for larger)\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n  1.

        "text":"Welcome Your IET account\nWoman in mask on public transport\n\nSafe post-pandemic transport solutions will be driven by data\n\nImage credit: Dreamstime\n\nCommuters\u2019 unwillingness to travel in close contact with strangers in the wake of Covid-19 is likely to boost uptake of autonomous \u2018mobility as a service\u2019 systems like electric robo-taxis that were once the stuff of science fiction.\n\nAs we ease out of lockdown, the importance of public authorities\u2019 role in mobility, transport and battling congestion will only increase. There\u2019s no return to \u2018business as usual\u2019\u00a0\u2013 the post-pandemic world will be very different\u00a0from what came before. However, there can\u2019t be a wider economic or social recovery without a comprehensive, progressive strategy for transport and mobility.\n\nFor the moment, the utmost priority for countries is to ensure the safety of citizens when travelling. At the same time they shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the bigger picture. Transport infrastructure is the lifeblood of an economy and the bedrock of people\u2019s lives. We have to be building a mobility model that\u2019s safe, efficient and sustainable many years into the future.\n\nMobility as a service (MaaS) has been crucial to these efforts during the last decade. However, persistent fears over infection and a hesitance to return to public transport could undo a great deal of progress. Indeed, the UK Department for Transport reported that April this year saw rail and Tube usage fall by over 95 per cent, and the number of bus passengers by 85 per cent. It\u2019s vital the Government shores up MaaS and builds on its foundations. A data-driven, autonomous MaaS transport system could prove to be the safest and most efficient option for the post-pandemic economy that commuters trust\n\nWill a return to relative normality inevitably lead to the return of widespread congestion in towns and cities? New car registrations in the UK rose by approximately 11 per cent year-on-year in July, with almost 175,000 sales, as consumers turned away from public transport in favour of personal vehicles.\n\nWhile not an unmanageable shift, we must proceed with caution. The risk of transmission may be lower in a car, but the side-effects of traffic congestion and emissions can be equally damaging. Recent reports suggest that pollution and low air quality can leave people at higher risk of contracting Covid-19, with the risk of death increasing by 15 per cent in heavily polluted areas. Congestion can also have a negative impact on economic growth and the quality of people\u2019s lives.\n\nThe need for sudden regional lockdowns only increases the likelihood of congestion as roads are closed and traffic diverted. Ultimately, public authorities will have to step in to keep congestion under control and flatten the traffic curve. The UK could take some inspiration from Singapore, where congestion has been managed innovatively using demand-based road pricing that offers financial incentives to drivers to avoid peak rush hours.\n\nA more palatable solution could come from MaaS and some of the recent trends that have been developing in the industry. The guiding principle is to provide consumers with travel solutions based on their present needs, rather than depending on a personal vehicle that might not always be the best option. The wider adoption of a MaaS network would reduce congestion and car emissions, while improving public health outcomes more generally.\n\nThe challenge policymakers face is convincing the public that such modes of travel are safe. The only way for the MaaS industry to survive in the short term will be dependent on government funding to support it through this period of fear and uncertainty.\n\nOver time, however, a greater use of electric autonomous technologies could help allay concerns. It\u2019s anticipated that the $75 billion due to be invested in the development of autonomous cars by 2023 could lead to more sophisticated and reliable solutions. MaaS offerings like electric robo-taxis and other passenger services used to be the stuff of science fiction, but they could prove a major comfort for travellers hesitant to share an enclosed vehicle with a stranger.\n\nOf course, electric autonomous vehicle networks need to be powered by the latest navigational solutions. In place of a human driver, onboard computers need up-to-date, accurate lane-level information on driving conditions and traffic in real-time. Services like\u00a0TomTom Traffic analyse real-time incidents and congestion to predict traffic before it happens. With billions of anonymised data points processed every second, autonomous vehicles will be able to avoid congested areas and transport their passengers safely from A to B.\n\nPublic authorities, businesses and consumers all play a key role in determining what the future of mobility will look like. Yet it will be down to public authorities to ensure the progress towards a cleaner, more efficient MaaS infrastructure is not in vain. Support for EVs, autonomous and smart-navigation technologies are crucial to building a transport system that is fit and safe for the future.\n\nUndoubtedly, remaking the system is no small undertaking and it will be years before a working and reliable model is in place. Yet innovation is a process rather than an end goal. Every advance or breakthrough will carry its own benefits that will build up over time. Work needs to start now to get the wheels turning on the national recovery.\n\nStephanie Leonard is head of government and regulatory affairs at TomTom.\n\nSign up to the E&T News e-mail to get great stories like this delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nRecent articles\n\nInfo Message\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.

Is this the same Th!nk that failed here before, went bankrupt, had their electric bike recalled and has annoying punctuation in their name? Yes. But they got that sweet sweet Kleiner Perkins VC money, right? True, that money has yet to produce a commercially successful car. The interesting history of all that below.\n\nOur first introduction to Kleiner Perkins and the world of electric vehicles came with their investment in EEstor, a company based in Texas working on an electric battery for ZENN Motors. Unfortunately, the Canadian governor is making it hard for ZENN to sell cars in Canada. So as of now, things aren't looking great, though battery development continues.\n\nMost recently, Kleiner Perkins came up with relation to the Fisker Karma Luxury Hybrid, which is a vehicle that piqued our interest due to its attractive proportions and relatively low price tag of $80K. Though the company has yet to experience the usual electric car delays, it is dealing with an incredible amount of litigation in the Fisker-Tesla girl fight. Will this delay production of the car? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nSpeaking of production delays, what about the Tesla roadster? Everyone was so excited about it but it has been delayed thanks to transmission problems, lawsuits, et cetera. Yes, they claim they're shipping production units now, but not only is it in low volumes, it's not even enough to fulfill the backlog of orders. Did we mention Tesla is backed by Kleiner Perkin's VC rivals at Draper Fisher Jurvetson.\n\nAnd don't get us started on the 2011\/2012\/201X Chevy Volt. An ongoing development that is being backed by an OEM \u2014 thus it relies not-so-much on VC dollars so much as R&D dollars. When will we see a production version of that particular vehicle? Your guess is as good as GM's word.\n\nBut hey, a 65 mph-capable electric car with potentially a 110-mile range for $25K, which Th!nk is offering, doesn't sound bad. Excuse our skepticism, but we'll believe it when we see it clear all the hurdles and successfully market itself to the tens of thousands of consumer they're planning to reach. Do we want cars like this to succeed? Yes. Electric cars, hybrid cars, biodiesel cars... whatever. Is it good, then, that firms are putting up the bank for these projects? Yes. We're just glad it isn't our money.\n\nIf you want an electric car for the city, full hybrids like the 2008 Mercury Mariner Hybrid can be driven in a way that they provide mostly electric power. While we're not huge fans of these hybrids in spirited driving, you can stretch a gallon of gas pretty far in slow city commuting. That's something.\n\n[Photo: Th!nk]",

PCMag India\n\nThe Internet of Cars Will Ruin the Roads\n\nFor safety's sake, it would be better if self-driving cars were kept totally autonomous, as in unable to chat with other cars or any system outside the car.\n\nEveryone thinks vehicles will be so much safer if they can somehow talk to each other; just look at the recent deal between Cisco and Hyundai.\n\nOpinionsThe idea of the networked car is not new. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) started hosting its Future Networked Car events in 2005, and they continue to this day.\n\nNetworking applies in two ways to automobiles. The first is the system within the car; the wiring harness that comprised dozens of wires making point-to-point connections with the buttons and switches on the dashboard is replaced by a network cable. Protocols tell lights to turn on and off and can also apply to steering and brakes. Toyota is a leader in this.\n\nThe second refers to car-to-car networking, where a bunch of vehicles on the road can \"talk\" to each other as a traffic control mechanism. The rationale for this is sketchy, although safety is mentioned a lot.\n\nThe emergence of the self-driving car sidelined these discussions. But the networking idea is not going away and will eventually merge with self-driving technology, providing a closed system of sorts. This will evolve into self-driving cars exchanging passenger and destination information for the coordination of fleets of cars providing taxi or ridesharing services.\n\nIt all sounds good on paper. In the real world, it is subject to numerous problems, not the least of which are hackers.\n\nMany of the most popular cars made today are trending towards \"fly-by-wire,\" with many of the subsystems\u2014including steering\u2014utilizing intra-car communications. We've already seen demos of potential car hacks that can stop your car remotely, or drive you off the road, and I've seen no evidence that these problems have been fixed.\n\nIt would be better if self-driving cars were kept totally autonomous\u2014as in, unable to chat with other cars or any system outside the car. That's the only way these futuristic concepts will work.\n\nOnce cars can communicate within a networked system, it introduces the possibility of easy remote access. If a car is not connected to any larger network, it makes a hack very difficult, like trying to hack a computer that's not on the internet. You'd have to infect it with a USB key or something inserted directly into the machine.\n\nBecause the entire world is gaga over networking everything, including the refrigerator and washer\/dryer is connected to the web under the Internet of Things banner. So no one will consider a vehicle that cannot communicate with the outside world.\n\nFuture hacks will explore simple possibilities, such as having the horn honk randomly or continuously until physically unhooked. Doors can lock and unlock. Windshield wipers can be on all the time. The trunk can randomly pop open. But more nefarious projects are certainly afoot; disabling a car completely with ransomware, for example. The possibilities for hijinks are endless.\n\nIf networked cars rely on a standard OS, the problem will worsen. But at least anti-malware could be written as a stop-gap measure. That will set off a new, car-centered cyberwar, just one of the many, looming IoT disasters. And nobody sees it coming.\n\nJohn C. Dvorak\nBy John C.

        "text":"200 Years of a German Shipping Family\n\nThe 3,731grt Ellen Hugo Stinnes was built in 1914 by Burmeister & Wain at Copenhagen as thePacific for Rederi A\/B Nordstjernan. She joined Stinnes in 1951. From 1964 she sailed as Steinweg for Atlas-Werke AG before reverting to Ellen Hugo Stinnes in 1966. In 1971 she joined Friedrich Krupp GmbH as Nedderland, and in 1978 she became Castos of Ensenada Armadora SA. On 3rd September 1980 she arrived at Calcutta to be broken up by India Metal Traders. Photo: Fotoflite\n\nHugo Dieter Stinnes (1870-1924) was an ambitious, dynamic but controversial entrepreneur, who went on to found the biggest business empire in Germany by the time of his death, covering shipping, coal, coke, gas, electricity, fuel briquettes, iron and steel, chemical, metallurgical and pharmaceutical industries. He entered into partnerships with the other great names in German industry e.g. Thyssen, Krupp, Kirdorf and Siemens. He was by no means just a shipowner, but also the controller of over 1,600 companies and subsidiaries and the employer of over 60,000 workers. He was also a member of the Reichstag Parliament of the Weimar Republic (1919-1933) and had far reaching political and business influence, and used his wealth to change the industrial infrastructure of Germany.\n\nHistory Of The Stinnes Family And Businesses\n\nMathias Stinnes (1790-1845) founded a coal mine and barge shipping business on the Ruhr and Rhine rivers in 1808 at Mulheim near Duisburg. The barge fleet eventually numbered over sixty barges and over twenty tugs, which was taken over on his death by his son Hermann Hugo Stinnes, and by his grandson Hugo Dieter Stinnes in 1890. Hugo Dieter Stinnes passed his graduation examinations and worked in an office at Koblenz where he received basic business training. He then worked for a few months as a miner at Wiethe Colliery, and a year later in 1889 he attended a course at the Academy of Mining in Berlin and a year later inherited his father\u2019s coal and barge businesses at the age of twenty years. However, Hugo Dieter Stinnes was dissatisfied with the traditional family business of operating barges, tugs, five coal mines and associated storage facilities, and immediately persuaded his mother to sell her ownership in the firm and lend him 50,000 gold marks to start his own business in 1892. He, however, retained technical management of the Mathias Stinnes A.G. mines, and later his many businesses eventually merged with the Mathias Stinnes A.G. businesses.\n\nIn the first decade of the new century, Hugo Dieter Stinnes expanded his own mining interests in Westphalia, the Rhine and Luxembourg areas, and in 1907 turned his attention away from river and coastal shipping to founding a deep sea shipping fleet as Hugo Stinnes Schiffahrt Ges. A fleet of thirteen colliers and tramps was ordered from German yards such as Bremer Vulkan for transatlantic trading to the U.S.A. and Canada as well as to traditional European countries with export coal from Germany. Two \u2018three island\u2019 tramps of 8,000 dwt were completed in 1910 as Clare Hugo Stinnes and Nora Hugo Stinnes on dimensions of 385.9 feet in length, moulded beam of 51.6 feet and depth of 26.8 feet, with a fo\u2019c\u2019stle of length 29 feet, bridge deck of 71 feet and poop deck of length 61 feet. Eleven colliers ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 dwt were also completed as Adeline Hugo Stinnes, Annie Hugo Stinnes, Dora Hugo Stinnes, Edmund Hugo Stinnes, Ernst Hugo Stinnes, Fritz Hugo Stinnes, Grete Hugo Stinnes, Heinrich Hugo Stinnes, Helene Hugo Stinnes, Hilde Hugo Stinnes and Otto Hugo Stinnes. English coal was also imported in large quantities via an agency office in Newcastle, and branch offices were set up at Rotterdam and Hamburg with a Head Office in Mulheim. The coal was used partly to drive turbines for the electricity production of the RWE power company on the Rhine, becoming a majority shareholder in RWE along with German steel magnate, Fritz Thyssen. He experimented with using gas burnt off from coke to recycle it for industrial use.\n\nThe 5,051grt Ostpreussen was built in 1914 by Burmeister & Wain at Copenhagen as the Kronprinsessan Margareta for Rederi A\/B Nordstjernan. She joined Stinnes in 1951 and in 1952 she was lengthened by 7.2 metres. On 5th January 1963 she arrived at Hamburg to be broken up. Photo: Fotoflite\n\n\nHugo Dieter Stinnes had married Clare Wagenknecht on 15th June 1895, the daughter of merchant Edmund Karl Wagenknech. His wife had been born at Montevideo on 26th November 1872 while her father was temporarily working in the Uruguayan capital. After her marriage to Hugo Dieter Stinnes, the couple had seven children in Edmund (1896-1980), Hugo Hermann (1897-1982), Clarenore (1901-1990), Otto (1903-1982), Hilde (1904-1975), Ernst (1911-1986) and Else (1913-1897). These family names were to be repeated time and again in the names of ships owned by the many family shipping companies and subsidiaries.\n\nClare Stinnes (nee Wagenknecht) was to have a very long and busy life, for she lived to attain one hundred years of age, dying at Mulheim on 17th January 1973. After the death of her husband on 10th April 1924 at the early age of 54 years, she became Managing Director of the huge business empire of Hugo Stinnes Gmbh, and until a few years before her death she played an active part as the head of the shipping, coal, industrial and banking enterprises.\n\nDuring World War I, there were shortages of coal and basic materials needed for normal existence in Germany, and as a consequence the Hugo Dieter Stinnes collier and tramping fleet made great profits. Some ships were lost but the survivors continued in the coastal trades after the end of the war. The Stinnes business interests in England and Holland were sequestrated by the Allies. Undaunted, the ambitions of their owner became apparent in 1916 as he wanted to not only compete with Hapag and Hamburg Sud on their worldwide services, but also if possible take them over. In 1916, he purchased the Woermann shipping business of Hamburg and their associated East African companies, and also purchased the biggest fleet operating out of Flensburg. He then ordered a very large fleet of passenger and cargo-liners, tramps and colliers in 1917 from German yards for completion after the end of the war. A very large fleet of two dozen ships was being operated from 1921 by Hugo Dieter Stinnes under a wide range of shipping, coal, and chemical company names.\n\nThe 2,802grt Heinrich Hugo Stinnes was built in 1923 by Workman Clark at Belfast as the Mayari for Unifruitco SS Co. In 1954 she joined Cia Maritima Ircar SA as Kismet before moving to Stinnes in 1955. On 7th January 1960 she arrived at Altenwerder to be broken up by Eisen u. Metall.\u00a0Photo: Fotoflite\n\nSubscribe today to read the full\u00a0article!\n\nSimply click below to subscribe and not only read the full article instantly, but gain unparalleled access to the specialist magazine for shipping enthusiasts.\n\nShip Show\n\nSubscribe nowLog In\n\n\nSign-up or login to comment\n\nUp next",
