These terms of reference, approved by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee at the heads of agency level, also apply to the UN Resident Coordinator, when acting as the DHA representative.\n\nThese terms of reference include 22 tasks, divided into four main categories:\n\n1) humanitarian assistance coordination mechanisms and agreements\n2) assessing and addressing humanitarian needs\n3) humanitarian advocacy\n4) information dissemination\n\nHumanitarian assistance coordination mechanisms and agreements\n\n1. Convening and serving as the Chair for meetings of the Disaster Management Team (DMT) in-country to deal with matters relating to the complex emergency in question, and providing the necessary secretariat support to the DMT. For purposes of dealing with the complex emergency in question, the regular DMT will usually be expanded to include other relevant entities, such as NGOs involved in related relief efforts.\n\n2. Reaching agreement on the basic division of responsibilities among the UN agencies, in accordance with their respective mandates and capacities, as well as working with the other relief entities to facilitate such agreements within the larger relief community.\n\n3. Developing and maintaining a central registry of locally represented humanitarian assistance agencies and organizations, including information on their respective activities and expertise.\n\n4. Ensuring that effective inter-agency coordination within specific sector areas is undertaken by the relevant agencies, and that coordination of the overall logistics needs of the relief operation is effectively undertaken.\n\n5. Obtaining guidance from the Designated Official regarding the implementation of security procedures in support of humanitarian assistance activities, ensuring that this is effectively communicated to the concerned agencies in the field, and facilitating their coordinated implementation.\n\n6. Acting as a focal point fort discussion within the relief community regarding policy issues of inter-agency concern (e.g. wage levels for local staff, difficulties with customs procedures and policies, government clearances for travel and passes, etc.) and as an interlocutor with the relevant parties (e.g., the host government) for resolution of such matters.\n\n7. Facilitating the provision of key support services for the larger relief community, such as telecommunications, transportation (e.g., via vehicle or light aircraft operation), etc.\n\n8. Ensuring consultation with government and national authorities on matters regarding the planning and implementation of humanitarian assistance\n\n9. Facilitating communications, and ensuring overall coordination, between the UN and other humanitarian aid agencies on the one hand and the relevant components of bilateral military forces and\/or those of UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations when such forces are present, including promoting resolution of matters of joint concern to the humanitarian aid agencies\n\nAssessing and addressing humanitarian needs\n\n10. Ensuring the overall coordination of inter-agency, multi-sectoral assessments of needs, including the identification of priority needs, and ensuring that such assessments are quickly initiated, adequately supported and effectively carried out.\n\n11. Coordinating the preparation of an overall humanitarian assistance strategy and Plan of Action of UN agencies, including the establishing of priorities for assistance and agreed collaborative approaches, and coordinating revisions and modifications as required by changing conditions and needs. The preparation and revision of this Plan should be done in close collaboration with the other relevant humanitarian assistance entities, including reflecting their activities and future plans in the Plan.\n\n12. Coordinating the preparation of inter-agency consolidated appeals for humanitarian assistance for the complex emergency in question, including working with the agencies both in-country and at the headquarters level to ensure that the actions described in the IASC Consolidated Appeal Guidelines (currently being finalized) are implemented.\n\n13. Monitoring the provision of resources against such appeals, bringing donor attention to important outstanding gaps, and facilitating inter-agency resource mobilization efforts both in-country as well as at the headquarters level (e.g., via local donor meetings and briefings, convening donor conferences if appropriate, etc.).\n\n14. Monitoring humanitarian needs and identifying specific gaps in the provision of humanitarian assistance. Working with UN and other entities to ensure that such gaps are addressed before they reach the crisis point.\n\n15. Facilitating ongoing strategic planning for the relief effort, including the provision of early warning of major changes in needs or delivery capacities, and contingency planning for such eventualities.\n\n16. Monitoring and facilitating UN humanitarian assistance to special population groups (e.g., internally displaced persons, demobilized soldiers, etc.) to ensure that it is provided in an adequate and timely manner, and coordinating such UN efforts (unless such coordination has been delegated by the Emergency Relief Coordinator to a specific agency).\n\n17. Ensuring that the necessary support is provided to field staff assisting in local coordination of humanitarian assistance and in situation monitoring.\n\n18. Ensuring that effective evaluations of the overall relief efforts, especially the coordination aspects, are undertaken, the lessons to be learned dearly identified, and appropriate follow-up actions taken.\n\n19. Cooperating with entities responsible for planning and implementation of rehabilitation and development activities to ensure that rehabilitation actions begin as soon as they become feasible (which will often be simultaneous with relief efforts), and that relief actions are planned and undertaken with the perspective of their longer-term impacts.\n\nHumanitarian advocacy\n\n20. Serving as focal point for the humanitarian community for ensuring the protection of humanitarian mandates in conflict situations, including by: (a.) seeking acceptance by all parties to the civil conflict in question on the key principles that must underlie UN humanitarian aid efforts (e.g. neutrality, impartiality, access to those in need, accountability to donors for aid provided, etc.); and (b.) promoting, assisting and if necessary, leading negotiations to obtain free, safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance to those in need. (c.) provide information to the Military and Political Department of UN missions assigned to a country to situate the humanitarian mandate in relation to political and military ones.\n\nInformation dissemination\n\n21. Collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information regarding humanitarian needs and operations to the wider community (e.g., through the production of regular Situation Reports).\n\n22. Ensuring the provision of timely, accurate and relevant information to media, and of briefing information to assist new agencies and NGOs, visiting missions and delegations, etc.",

NSC June 2009\n\nThis is a suite of policies designed to meet the needs of an ageing population. The emphasis is on developing a range of accommodation to provide greater choice and independence. It reflects a move away from traditional care homes towards support for different types of assisted independent living.\u00a0\n\nPolicy DM 40: Retirement accommodation and supported independent living for older and vulnerable people\n\nDM40 retirement accomm\n\nThe council will support development of a range of accommodation aimed at independent living for older and vulnerable people provided that:\n\n  \u2022 it is located within the settlement boundary;\n  \u2022 shops, public transport, community facilities and medical services can be reached easily by those without access to a car, as appropriate to the needs and level of mobility of potential residents; and\n  \u2022 it will provide an appropriate standard of facilities, independence, support and\/or care.\n\nThe provision of accommodation aimed at achieving various degrees of independent living for older or vulnerable people will be required on all residential planning developments over 100 dwellings.\n\nPolicy DM 41: Nursing and care homes for older people and other vulnerable people (includes drug and alcohol rehabilitation centres)\n\nPlanning permission will not be granted for extensions to or new residential care or nursing homes within Class C2 of the Use Classes Order (including the change of use of an existing property) unless:\n\n  \u2022 the new proposal replaces an existing similar sized care home in North Somerset which will no longer be used for that purpose and there is a continuing identified local need; or where it can be demonstrated that there is insufficient provision in the locality to meet local need for that type of specialist care;\n  \u2022 the proposal is within a defined settlement boundary. Outside settlement boundaries evidence will need to be provided that no alternative site exists within the towns or villages and that it is accessible by public transport;\n  \u2022 the proposals itself or in conjunction with other similar uses or proposals nearby, will not harm the overall environmental, social or economic character of the surrounding area and\/or character and amenities of adjacent properties; and\n  \u2022 sufficient outdoor space is available for quiet relaxation either within the curtilage or in reasonable proximity.\n\nWhere appropriate, conditions will be attached to any new proposal to restrict any subsequent change of use to an alternative type of care home or use.\n\nA separate evidence paper has been produced setting out the background data to develop policy for the Planning Management of Care Homes and schemes for Older People. The document can be viewed here.\n\nPolicy DM 42: Lifetime homes\n\nAll new residential development including residential annexes aimed at older people and age-restricted either by planning condition or as part of any leasing\/renting agreement will be required to meet the Lifetime Homes Standards.\n\nAll new build residential developments over 10 dwellings will be required to be constructed to Lifetime Home standards. Conversions will be expected to meet the standards as far as practicable.\u00a0\n\nDM43 residential annex\n\nPolicy DM 43: Residential annexes\n\nWithin settlement boundaries proposals will be permitted for residential annexes where they meet the design standards set out in policy DM 31 (High quality design and place making).\n\nIn other settlements and the countryside annexes will only be permitted where they are clearly an extension to the main dwelling and can be converted into the main dwelling once there is no longer a need for the annex. Proposals which are not designed as an integral part of the house will not be permitted.\n\nNote: Any proposals in the Green Belt will also need to comply with Policy DM 13 (Development within the Green Belt).\n\nPolicy DM 44\n\nGypsy and Travellers\n\n\nCore Strategy Policies\n\nCS 18 Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling Show people\n\nReplacement Local Plan Policies\n\nH\/12 Sites for gypsies and travelling show people\n\n\nPolicy Intentions:\n\n  \u2022 Ensure that any new sites are well related to local services and facilities and do not impact on the surrounding countryside.\n  \u2022 To minimise tensions between the settled and travelling communities.\n  \u2022 Ensure that any sites meet the needs of the travelling community.\n  \u2022 Avoid circumstances where there is pressure to grant permission on appeal on inappropriate sites.\n\n\nThis policy is based on the Core Strategy policy but updated to reflect the changes introduced by the government's Planning Policy for Traveller Sites and taking into account the North Somerset Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Consultation 2011. A 'call for sites' initiative in the context of the Gypsy and Travellers Site Allocations DPD in 2009 failed to identify deliverable sites which met appropriate locational or site suitablility criteria. A decision was taken not to proceed with that document and instead to incorporate the Gypsy and Traveller site allocations as part of the Sites and Policies Plan. The Weston Villages SPD recognised the potential of this new strategic allocation to either identify suitable sites within the development or to negotiate off-site locations for residential sites for Gypsies and Travellers. Following an initial consideration of potential opportunities to bring forward sites as part of the Weston Villages development and discussion with landowners, two off-site opportunities have been identified. One of these at Old Junction Yard is proposed as an allocation. The other site west of Winterstoke Road is allocated for mixed use, but it is recognised that a Gypsy and Traveller site in this location may also be appropriate, but that will require further investigation. Further consideration will also be given to the potential to deliver additional sites within the Weston Villages development or at off-site locations, as the proposals for the development are further developed and in line with the Weston Villages SPD.\u00a0\n\n\nPolicy DM 44: Gypsies and Travellers\n\nThe council will seek to meet the identified requirement of 60 pitches by 2016 through the allocation of sites and the granting of planning consent.\n\nLand at Old Junction Yard, Winterstoke Road, Weston-super-Mare as shown on the Proposal Map, is allocated as a Gypsy and Traveller site to accommodate around 20 managed residential pitches with the potential for the inclusion of a small number of short stay transit pitches.\n\nIn addition, the mixed use allocation of land west of Winterstoke Road, Weston-super-Mare as shown on the Proposals Map for residential and employment use may also represent an opportunity to investigate its potential to accommodate a small (around 12 managed pitches) Gypsy and Traveller site as part of a mixed use development. This will require further detailed investigations to address in particular flood risk and its relationship to neighbouring uses.\n\nIn determining planning applications for gypsy and traveller sites priority will be given to sites that are outside of the Green Belt and Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and are:\n\ni) Within settlement boundaries and in particular within the Weston Villages;\n\nii) On previously developed land;\n\niii) Close to local services and facilities;\n\niv) Capable of being developed without dominating or harming the character and living conditions of adjacent property and the local area;\n\nv) Well located to the major road network.\n\nIn order to meet the identified need, sites outside of settlement boundaries may have to be considered These will have to be sensitively located and meet criteria (ii) - (v) above.",
