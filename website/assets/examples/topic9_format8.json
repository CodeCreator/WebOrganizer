        "text":"Condiciones de servicio | Atlasmic\n\nTerms of Service\n\nThese Terms govern your access to and use of as well as all content and Atlasmic products and services available at or through these websites (collectively, \u201cServices\u201d). Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance, without modification, of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, Atlasmic\u2019s Privacy Policy), and procedures that may be published from time to time by Atlasmic (collectively, the \u201cAgreement\u201d). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and the Agreement will apply to any upgrades. Please read the Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms of the Agreement, then you may not access or use our Services.\n\n1. Who\u2019s who\n\nThroughout these Terms, \u201cyou\u201d applies to both individuals and entities that access or use our Services. If you are an individual using our Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to the Agreement and that by using our Service(s), you are accepting the Agreement on behalf of that entity.

We refer to MB Atlasmic collectively as \u201cAtlasmic\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d throughout these Terms.\n\n2. Your account\n\nWhere use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account and keep the information current. This is important because sometimes we may need to send you notable updates (for example, about changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or we may want to let you know about and make informed choices in response to legal inquiries or complaints.\nYou will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your account. You are responsible for keeping your account information up-to-date and for keeping your password secure.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any Service-related content, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.\nWhen you create an Atlasmic account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may contact you to share more details about what we have to offer. Don't worry -- if you aren't interested in learning more, you can opt out of the marketing communication, whether it's an email, phone call, or text message.\n\n3. Minimum age requirements\n\nOur Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for or use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older (or 16 years or older in the European Union).\n\n4. Responsibility of visitors and users\n\nWe have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the content (such as, but not limited to, text, photo, video, audio, code, computer software, items for sale, or other materials) posted to our Services by users or anyone else (\u201cContent\u201d) and are not responsible for any use or effects of such Content. So, for example:\n  \u2022 We do not endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or non-harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights (see our Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy section to submit copyright complaints), or other proprietary rights of third parties.\n  \u2022 If you post Content, comment on a website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) Content available on our Services, you are entirely responsible for the Content, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct.\n  \u2022 We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone\u2019s use, purchase, or downloading of Content. If you access or use any Content, you are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.\n  \u2022 We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.\n  \u2022 Please note that additional third party terms and conditions may apply to the downloading, copying, purchase, or use of Content.\nWe also have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and web pages that link to, or are linked from, Atlasmic or our other Services. For example:\n  \u2022 We do not have any control over those websites and are not responsible for their contents or their use.\n  \u2022 The existence of a link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse such website.\n  \u2022 You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.\n  \u2022 We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from non-Atlasmic websites.\n\n5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal\n\nFees for Paid Services.\nSome of our Services are offered for a fee,such as Atlasmic plans, and some paid apps (collectively, \u201cPaid Services\u201d). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees, and fees associated with specific features. These fees may be one-time fees, recurring fees, or revenue-based fees. For recurring fees, we\u2019ll bill or charge you for in regular automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.\nDepending on which billing option you choose (like monthly vs. annually), there may be different features available or policies that apply to your Paid Service.\nTo the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future (\u201cTaxes\u201d). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you\u2019ve paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.\nIf your payment fails, Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, or we suspect a payment is fraudulent, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services.\nAutomatic renewal.\nTo ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, if you purchase an Atlasmic annual plan, you will be charged each year for the following 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you are checking your email (including any spam or other filters) in order to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of renewal. The date for the automatic renewal is determined automatically based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. You can view your renewal date for Atlasmic Paid Services by visiting your workspace settings billing page.\nCancelling automatic renewal.\nYou can manage and cancel your Paid Services at the respective Service\u2019s site. For example, you can manage each workspace Atlasmic plan through its respective billing page in workspace settings.\nTo cancel a Atlasmic plan, go to your workspace billing page and click \"Cancel plan\". You must repeat this process for each workspace plan you wish to cancel.\nFee changes.\nWe may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were previously free. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don\u2019t agree with the fee changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.\nWhile you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless otherwise required by applicable law.\n\n6. General representation and warranty\n\nYou represent and warrant that your use of our Services:\n  \u2022 Will be in strict accordance with these Terms;\n  \u2022 Will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, all applicable laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, privacy, data protection, the transmission of technical data exported from the the country in which you reside, the use of financial services, notific...

You are welcome to contact us for more specific information and advice.\n\nPrices and orders\n\nPrices quoted include VAT and exclude delivery.\n\nWhen you place an order online you should receive an automated email from Worldpay or PayPal to confirm they are processing your payment, and another automated email from us to acknowledge your order and give you an order number.\n\nWe will then check and process your order. We reserve the right not to accept an order.\u00a0\n\nIf we do not accept your order, for example because we do not have enough stock or a workshop is full, we will tell you in writing and we will not charge you. We expect these occasions to be rare.\n\nYour order is accepted when we dispatch your products or confirm your booking. Acceptance of your order will create a contract between us and we will send you a full sales invoice.\n\nWe aim to complete our side of all contracts within 30 days, although we are usually much quicker.\n\n\nOur standard delivery charge is \u00a33.99. This covers Royal Mail second-class delivery of a small package up to 2kg, delivered to any single address in the UK. We expect this to be sufficient for most consumer orders. If your order is larger than that, you are welcome to contact us before placing it, or we may contact you about delivery method and any charges.\n\nUnless special arrangements are made between us we cannot guarantee delivery by a particular date and are not legally responsible for delivery by a particular date.\n\nDelivery and orders outside the UK\n\nDeliveries to European countries are charged at a standard rate of \u00a35.40, including VAT. This covers Royal Mail International Standard delivery of a small package of up\u00a0 to 2kg, delivered to any single address in the EU.\n\nDeliveries to the Rest of the World are charged at a standard rate of \u00a39.99.

There may sometimes be minor variations between the products or packaging pictured and those supplied. If these minor variations are not acceptable to you, you can return goods under your cooling off \/ changing your mind rights.\n\nCooling off \/ changing your mind rights\n\nYou can change your mind about an order you\u2019ve placed or a product you\u2019ve received. If you change your mind please let us know as soon as possible by email to info@paincareclinic.co.uk.\n\nIf you inform us before dispatch of an item, we will not send out the product.\n\nIf you change your mind after you\u2019ve received an item, you must inform us within 14 days of receiving it that you wish to cancel your order. After that, you have a further 14 days to return the item to us.\n\nAll items returned must be unused, in their original undamaged packaging and capable of re-sale. You are responsible for looking after an item while it remains with you.\n\nYou are also responsible for returning an item to us. This includes choosing an appropriate method of return, and paying the costs of return and any insurance against loss or damage, if you wish to take this out.\n\nWe will confirm by email when returned items have been received by us and whether the condition is acceptable for a refund. Assuming it is, we will authorise a refund without quibble. We will refund the price and any standard delivery charges you paid.\n\nFor appointments and workshops the situation is slightly different, see below.\n\nFaulty products\n\nAs well as having cooling off rights or rights to change your mind about an order, consumers also have statutory rights in relation to faulty products. By faulty products, we mean products with serious defects or products that are not as described or are not fit for their purpose.\n\nYou can return faulty products and ask for either a replacement or a full refund.\n\nIf you intend to return a faulty product, please let us know by email as soon as you realise the product is faulty, as this can affect whether you are entitled to a refund or a replacement.\n\nOnce you have notified us that the product is faulty, please return it to us so we receive it within a further 14 days.\n\nIf a product is found to be faulty within 30 days of purchase we will offer you a full refund or a replacement.\n\nIf goods are found to be faulty within 6 months of purchase, we may offer you a repair or a replacement instead.\n\nCooling off rights do not apply to workshops or appointments if these are booked within 30 days of the start date. However, we will still try to accommodate a cancellation if we can. See Appointments and Workshops.\n\n\nWhere you are entitled to a refund for a cancelled order or faulty product, we will process your refund as soon as possible after satisfactory return of the relevant item. Occasionally, it may take us up to 30 days to process a refund.\n\nRefunds will be made to the card or account used for payment.\n\n\nAll appointments must be paid for in advance or on the day.\n\nWe sometimes have a waiting list for appointments. If you would like to cancel or change an appointment you have already booked, please let us know as soon as possible so we can offer the appointment to someone else.\n\nWe have a 48-hour cancellation policy. This means that if you don\u2019t give us at least 48 hours\u2019 notice that you wish to cancel or re-arrange an appointment, we will charge in full for the appointment. We will charge you even if we find someone else to take the appointment.\n\nWe can accept payment for missed appointments by card or bank transfer.\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse appointment requests or to cancel appointments.\n\n\nWe schedule all workshops carefully and with the intention that they will go ahead as planned. All workshops must be paid for in full at the time of booking.\n\nWe may decide to cancel a workshop, for example if we do feel we have enough bookings to make it a worthwhile workshop experience. If we cancel a workshop, we will offer you a refund or a place on another workshop.\n\nWe are not responsible for reimbursing any travel or accommodation costs you may be responsible for.\n\nYou can change your mind and cancel a workshop booking, provided there is still 30 days or more before the workshop is scheduled to run. You can\u2019t change your mind about attending a workshop after it has run.\n\nIf you cancel your workshop booking with less than 30 days to go before the workshop, you do not have the right to either a refund or a place on another workshop. However, if we have someone on a waiting list who can take your place we will exercise our discretion.\n\nMatters outside our control\n\nIf we cannot supply goods or services for reasons beyond our control, we are not obliged to offer you a refund, and we are not responsible for any losses you may incur.\n\nPayment and ownership of products\n\nAs a precaution against non-payment, legal ownership of products belongs to us until full payment is made.\n\n\nWe are entitled to charge interest on all invoices until full payment.\n\nLegal liability and professional accountability\n\nIt is always our intention to provide you with goods and services that meet legal and professional standards.\n\nWe don\u2019t limit our liability for defective products where it would be unlawful to do so.\n\nPrivacy and data protection\n\nWe are registered with the UK data protection registrar.\n\nWe respect your privacy online and offline.
