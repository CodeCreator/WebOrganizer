To me a role model is a person who has positively influenced someone in life, and is not a person filled with selfishness and greed. They help shape someone\u2019s personality, and characteristics. They are people who someone can look up to for advice in a hard situation, and know that they will give those words of wisdom. They will never judge our past actions, instead only look to help because they really care. A role model is someone who we should never feel awkward talking to about our problems. A perfect role model for me is my mother. She is a wonderful human being. She\u2019s smart, wise, ambitious, patient and such a loving person. There are no words that can describe my gratitude towards her, but through this essay I will describe some of her characteristics that makes her my role model. To begin with, I would like to describe my mom\u2019s ambition. Life was not easy with her, my father died when my bother was six years old and I was two. She was a single mother of two children and the head of the family. She woke up every morning with the positive attitude, and a smile on her face, even when she did not feel like it. She was always searching for ways to improve her persona, and live a happier life. My mom has worked really hard to give my brother and I the lifestyle we had. For example on my birthday she saved money for a month to do my birthday party and, she never missed one. My mom\u2019s ambition to succeed in life has allowed her to grow into a wonderful person full of kindness and knowledge. Ambition is a great virtue to have, and that is one reason why my mother is my role model. My mother is a hard worker, she never complains about her life also, she always gets what she wants. If I ever need my mom\u2019s advice or help she will be always there for me even today. My mother is a wise, smart and educated person, she has not any...\ntracking img",

He strongly feels, as do I, that people with similarities and a common ground are able to get along better and connect better with one of their kind, rather than a complete opposite. Aristotle found that several people believed that there is only one kind of friendship. As a philosopher, though, he went on to explain that there is a possibility to have three different kinds of friendship, or three levels of friendship. It is necessary for there to be some sort of bond or connection in order for a friendship to develop, especially to a level three virtuous friendship. However, this idea is even true in level one and two, utility and pleasure friendships. The most insignificant, and short-lived level of friendship is a friendship based solely on utility, basically a friendship based on convenience. These friendships are self-centered friendships that only exist for the good of one party. Examples of utility friendships are business partners, carpooling, or study groups. I personally know that these kinds of friendships exist, whether I would like to admit it or not. How many of us would stop being friends with the kid down the hall if he was not the smart kid who could help you with homework? The next level of friendship is the friendship based solely on pleasure. These are, incidentally, friendships that last a little longer than utility friendships but are still not everlasting. In these friendships, the person is accepted and admired for the pleasure the person brings, whether it be laughter or satisfaction. Once the pleasure has exhausted itself, there is no longer a need for the friendship, and the people usually lose contact with one another. Casual sexual relationships or relationships with people for purely their sense of humor or some other trait are examples of pleasurable friendships. These friendships, once again, satisfy...\ntracking img",

The article explores the regional variations in household composition by focusing on the living arrangements of young couples. The main question addressed by this article is whether or not part of the regional differences observed in household structure can be explained by different patterns of postnuptial coresidence among parents and young married children. The theoretical link between household composition and coresidence patterns between generations relies on analyses of stylized versions of family systems, namely the conjugal, stem and joint systems. Postnuptial coresidence, for example, is associated with the joint family system in which all sons join the parental home with their spouse. The necessity to set up a new household after marriage, in turn, is an aspect of the conjugal family system. In the stem family system, postnuptial coresidence may occur for one child only or for all of them, although usually as a prelude to the set up of a new household.\nDocument Type:\u00a0Article de recherche\nIssue Date:\u00a01 May 2000\nOpen Access Date:\u00a0Restricted access\nDocument version:\u00a0VoR\nThis document was published in:\u00a0Journal of Comparative Family Studies, Vol. 31 (2), 171\u2013189 (2000)\nUniversity of Calgary\nCollection:Articles publi\u00e9s dans des revues avec comit\u00e9 de lecture\n\nFiles in this item:\nDescription SizeFormat\u00a0\nBelanger 2000 Regional Differences.pdf\n2.14 MBAdobe PDF\u00a0 \u00a0 Request a copy\nBelanger 2000 Regional Differences.pdf\n2.14 MBAdobe PDF\u00a0 \u00a0 Request a copy\nAll documents in CorpusUL are protected by Copyright Act of Canada.",

Their love can make their family comfortable, make life easier, and unite family members. Patricia Hampl, \u201cGrandmother\u2019s Sunday Dinner,\u201d describes how her grandmother ruled over her family with her authoritative personality. And also, Hampl\u2019s grandmother made her family members united with her professional cooking skills. Similar to Hampl\u2019s grandmother, my grandmother rules over my family. My grandmother\u2019s personality is not authoritative, and her cooking skills are not good compared to Hampl\u2019s grandmother. However, her love sill makes out family united.

Since my grandfather passed away when my mother was young, my grandmother raised my mother and two uncles by herself. My grandmother is from a family of six siblings, and she is the youngest one. My grandmother told me she never cooked or learned how to cook because all of her siblings did it for her. Therefore, unlike Hampl\u2019s grandmother, my grandmother is not good at cooking. Since all of my family members live in different countries, we do not get many chances to see each other. If we are lucky, we see each other once a year and we always get together at the grandmother\u2019s house. When all of my family members gather at the foremother\u2019s house, my grandmother always puts all of her effort into making good meals for us. Since she is not good at cooking, all of my family members gather together in the kitchen and help her to cook. I always find true happiness in the kitchen because all of us talk about life and make stupid jokes with riotous laughter. Grandmother\u2019s house is a shelter for our family members because it is the only place that all of us can get out of where we are right now and relax without having any worries. Maybe my grandmother\u2019s dinner is not the best dinner compared to Hampl\u2019s grandmother\u2019s dinner in good qualities, but I still love eating my grandmother\u2019s meal because I can feel her love.

Several decades of research indicate that people are rather inept lie detectors (Levine, Park, & McCornack, 1999). This unimpressive ability to detect deception is due, in part, to the fact that deceivers inconsistently mark their deceptive practices. As a result, deceptive message judgments are often based on the use of cognitive heuristics rather than an accurate set of deception cues. This research explores how situational and personality factors influence veracity judgments in the context of intimate relationships. Ultimately, the findings presented are linked to larger theoretical implications regarding factors that may activate the use of the truth-bias heuristic.\n\nDeceptive Message Judgments\n\nAlthough some research still appears to be driven by the quest to identify the behavioral correlates of deception, many critical challenges to this line of inquiry have arisen. In particular, scholars raise serious doubts about the idea that people consistently mark deceptive practices. First, scholars question the assumption that increased arousal and\/or cognitive demands lead to behavioral manifestations when lying (e.g., Fiedler & Walka, 1993; McCornack, 1997). Most deceptive practices are not particularly challenging or arousing given that such acts are repeatedly performed (DePaulo, Kashy, Kirkendol, Wyer, & Epstein, 1996) with little awareness (Lippard, 1988) and effort (Di Battista, 1994). Moreover, persuasive claims have been made that truth-telling involves the active construction of messages and therefore can be just as cognitively demanding as lying (McCornack, 1997). Second, even if one assumes a consistent link between lying and changes in cognitive load or arousal, this does not mean that such changes would be manifested in a consistent manner (Fiedler & Walka, 1993).\n\nThe empirical evidence does not support the theoretical claims currently under attack. Despite decades of work, researchers consistently acknowledge an inability to identify a universal set of deception cues, even though both popular belief and theoretical expectations would suggest their presence (Zuckerman, Koestner, & Driver, 1981). The deception cues that emerge represent small, average differences that vary across situational contexts rather than diagnostic indicators regarding what any given individual is likely to do in any given context. In short, deception cues vary across individuals, situational features, interactional dynamics, and the nature of the lie being told (Buller, Burgoon, Buslig, & Roiger, 1996; Buller, Burgoon, White, & Ebesu, 1994; Burgoon, Buller, Ebesu, White, & Rockwell, 1996; Ebesu & Miller, 1994). Compounding the problem, detectors tend to focus on more nondiagnostic indicators rather than focusing on cues that might, on average, lead to slightly more accurate judgments (e.g., Stiff & Miller, 1986; Zuckerman et al., 1981). Taken together, neither theoretical arguments nor empirical evidence strongly supports the idea that people should be able to consistently detect deception based on observation alone.\n\nThe lack of reliable deception cues, however, does not prevent people from making veracity judgments. In fact, most people think they can always tell when others are lying (Shippee, 1977), especially in close relationships (Miller et al., 1984 cited in Miller & Stiff, 1992). Ironically, people's confidence in their ability to detect deception is often inversely related to their actual skill (see, for review, Kalbfleisch, 1992) and people frequently overestimate their lie detection competency (Miller & Stiff, 1993).\n\nThese results suggest an interesting question: If people lack adequate information, how do they make veracity judgments with such assurance? To solve this dilemma, researchers cast lie detection as an information-processing task influenced by the use of cognitive heuristics. \u2026\n\nAuthor Advanced search\n\n\nAn unknown error has occurred.

However, there has been remarkably little cross\u2010fertilization of ideas and concepts. In this study, we consider the relevance of the interactional sociolinguistic concept of relationality for symbolic interactionist theories of authenticity. We first disambiguate two forms of authenticity that are commonly studied but not clearly differentiated in symbolic interactionist research\u2014self\u2010authenticity, which emphasizes selves, and social authenticity, which emphasizes social identities. We then argue that relationality and its three pairs of interactional tactics\u2014verification and denaturalization, adequation and distinction, and authorization and illegitimation\u2014are particularly useful in conceptualizing social authenticity. We draw on data from an interethnic internet forum to show how members of two ethnic groups, Hungarian and Romanian, employ these relational tactics to authenticate their own ethnicity as the rightful inheritors of a place\u2010based Transylvanian identity, and to limit the other ethnicity's similar identity work. We then clarify the significance of social authenticity for the interactional study of category\u2010based identities by widening our discussion to other contestations over social identities in everyday life.",

This article is based on a study, conducted for an honours thesis, which invited four Japanese wives living in South East Queensland to describe, together with their Australian husbands, their family\u2019s interactions with Japan, its language and culture, and the local Japanese community. It was recognised that the extensive social networks these wives had established and maintained with local Japanese women from other Japanese-Australian intermarriage families were an important part of their migrant experience.\n\nThis article will firstly review the literature on contemporary Japanese- Australian intermarriage in Australia and Japanese lifestyle migration to Australia. It will then describe and examine the involvement and motivations of the four wives in their social networks. Entry into motherhood was found to be the impetus for developing and participating in informal, autonomous networks. Additionally, regular visits to Japan were focused on engagement with existing family and friendship networks. The contemporary experience of intermarriage for these women is decidedly transnational and fundamentally different from that of the war brides, or sens\u014d hanayome.\n\n\nResearch into Japanese residents, migrants and families in Australia, as well as their local ethnic communities, has slowly accumulated over the last 20 years. The lives, histories, and contributions of Japanese have been examined by historical works and celebrated in various commemorative publications which have explored the relationship between\u00a0Australia and Japan.1\u00a0These studies have also been generated as part of celebrations of Queensland\u2019s multiculturalism and diverse ethnic communities.2\n\nAn early investigation of the Japanese community in Brisbane focused on the integration of Japanese residents into Australian society.3\u00a0Fieldwork that is more recent has thrown light on the emergence of deterritorialised urban ethnic communities developing around autonomous and non-organisational social networks.4\u00a0Similar observations have been made by other studies conducted in Sydney and Melbourne.5\u00a0While sojourning corporate families have been a feature of Japanese communities in Australia from the 1960s through to the mid-1990s, their proportion has dropped considerably due to an increase in other migrant types.6\u00a0Sat\u014d refers to them as \u2018lifestyle migrants\u2019,7\u00a0and Nagatomo draws upon this concept to understand Japanese migration to Australia as a form of transnational leisure.8\u00a0The diasporic experiences and identity negotiations of Japanese residents is another aspect which has been researched, albeit to a limited degree.9\n\nThere remain few gendered perspectives on the migration of Japanese to Australia. One example is Nagata\u2019s re-examination of prostitutes in the prewar Japanese diaspora.10\u00a0However, while postwar migrants have been predominantly female there has been an absence of rigorous discussion about gender and its role in their migration experiences. The scope of the original study upon which this article is based was not ambitious enough to correct this. However, the work has attempted to provide a starting point for a more thorough examination of gender in Japanese migration to Australia by identifying, in particular, the role of motherhood in the development of and participation in informal, autonomous networks with other Japanese mothers of similar migrant backgrounds.\n\nThis article will firstly review the literature on contemporary Japanese- Australian intermarriage in Australia and Japanese lifestyle migration to Australia. Next, the methodology of my original study will be outlined. Finally, the involvement and motivation of Japanese wives who have established and maintained extensive social\u00a0networks with local Japanese from other Japanese-Australian intermarriage families in South East Queensland will be described and examined.\n\nContemporary Japanese-Australian Intermarriage in Australia\n\nResearchers have used a variety of terms to refer to the marriage of people from different backgrounds, including cross-cultural marriage and interracial marriage.11\u00a0The translated form of the Japanese term kokusai kekkon, or \u2018international \u00a0marriage\u2019, is also used.12\u00a0Each of these foregrounds one particular aspect of difference: culture, race, and nationality respectively. Penny and Khoo use intermarriage, explaining that its definition \u2018depends on the perceptions about what is different within the society in which the marriage takes place\u201913\u00a0and may involve religion, birthplace, and socioeconomic status, in addition to the previous three. While considering such differences where they occur, their Australian study of migration and integration focuses on the intermarriage of individuals born and raised in Australia and their partners who were born and raised in other countries. My study followed this usage.\n\nA typology of Japanese residents in Australia separates intermarriage couples into two generational groups.14\u00a0The first are the war brides of the 1950s who married Australian servicemen stationed in Japan during the Allied occupation after \u00a0the Pacific War.\u00a0 The second are the contemporary marriages of mainly younger \u00a0women in their 30s and 40s. This work is concerned with the second generational group and will not undertake a thorough comparative analysis. However, it is important to note briefly at this point that interviews with war brides have revealed that many experienced loneliness and alienation, with little opportunity to associate with other Japanese, speak Japanese or obtain Japanese foodstuffs. With many coming to regard Australia as their home and choosing to become citizens, yet still proudly maintaining their ethnic origins, Nagata describes them as having a hyphenated cultural identity: Japanese-Australians.15\n\nIt is difficult to obtain a clear picture of contemporary Japanese-Australian intermarriage through official statistics. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the population of Japan-born residents for 2007 at 45,613,16\u00a0however no detailed data which may indicate how many are married to Australian citizens appears to have\u00a0been kept. The report of the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs entitled \u2018The People of Australia\u2019, contains the most useful and recent data available.17\u00a0Using figures from the 2001 Census, it shows that 6,232 people born in Australia responded that Japan was the birthplace of one or both of their parents. Of those, 620 had an Australian mother and Japanese father, and 1,955 had a Japanese mother with an Australian father. However, these figures do not account for couples who have no children, whose children were born overseas, or how many are still dependants of their parents.\n\nReflected in these figures is the gender imbalance of Japanese migrants to Australia. Both Australian and Japanese government figures agree that approximately 63% of Japanese migrants are women.18\u00a0This is attributed to the migration of Japanese women who have married Australian men.19\u00a0In Mizukami\u2019s Melbourne study,20\u00a0the greatest proportion of female settlers (36.8%) responded that their main reason for migration was \u2018to marry someone in Australia\u2019, with almost half of all female settlers married to an Australian. In contrast, no male respondents gave marriage as their main reason for migration. In Nagatomo\u2019s Brisbane fieldwork,21\u00a0eight of the 26 permanent residents were married to Australian citizens. Though he provides no breakdown of their gender, half of these eight couples married after the Japanese partner had embarked on a working holiday to Australia. Based on his explanation of factors that account for the high number of young Japanese women engaging in overseas tourism and working holidays to Australia, it is likely that the intermarriage couples in his work also reflect the contemporary gender imbalance.\n\nStatistical analysis of Japanese residents in Australia may reveal their diverse demographic and socioeconomic characteristics but is limited in its capacity to portray this diversity.22\u00a0In the case of Japanese-Australian intermarriage, the lack of statistical data provides no conclusive insights, though it would appear there is a tendency for the wife to be the Japanese partner. It is here that qualitative studies can make a significant contribution.\n\nSat\u014d\u2019s interview-based ethnographic work examines the everyday lives and value orientations of Japanese migrants to Australia.23\u00a0Based on interviews with over 200 long-term residents, she identifies their overseas residency as motivated by\u00a0the pursuit of a better quality of life rather than a desire to escape from economic hardship. She refers to them as lifestyle migrants, a phenomenon which is discussed in the following section. In her chapter on \u2018the bright side and dark side of cross- cultural marriage\u2019, she refers to the gender imbalance and claims that the marriages of Japanese women and Australian men are \u2018statistically\u2026more likely to endure\u2019 than those of Japanese men to Australian women.24 However, her book is unreferenced and the source of this information is not given. She believes that these patterns in Japanese- Australian intermarriage are suggestive of cultural attitudes to gender and gender roles which categorise Japanese wives in two ways: those eager to escape gender restrictions from a still largely patriarchal Japanese society, or traditional women who come for other reasons and find themselves attractive because of their old-fashioned attitudes. In her presentation of the varied experiences and reflections of her Japanese informants, includ... (truncated)",

This sub-project was a collaboration between Wiltshire-based, not-for-profit group Tidworth Mums, Wiltshire Council, Army Welfare Service, the Open University and The Glass-House.\n\nTidworth Mums are an active provider and supporter of creative and playful activities for local families in the garrison town of Tidworth. The group had a vision to create a soft play facility locally and wanted to explore how this might be achieved. Working with our project partners, we co-designed a series of activities with the Mums. An asset mapping exercise (developed through a previous research project,\u00a0Creative Citizens) helped to map out assets available or within reach of the group, and showed that their strongest and most active assets were their relationships with local people and networks.\n\nWith support from play ambassadors, Nicola Butler (Hackney Play Association) and Robin Sutcliffe (Sutcliffe Play), The Glass-House organised a study tour of play facilities in London for the group, where they learned about different types of play activities and what is involved in managing play centres.\n\nTo better understand local views on play and test a model of \u2018pop-up\u2019 play activities, we co-designed a Mega Soft Play Day during half term in February 2014. As well as a providing a host of soft play activities, the event also involved creative activities to gather opinions and ideas about future play provision in Tidworth, including a \u2018jelly bean vote\u2019 and an arts and crafts section for children to create their dream playspaces.\n\nFinally, we worked together to explore different business models for the provision of soft play in Tidworth. The group concluded that whatever way soft play is provided locally, they were committed to ensuring this happens in an informed way.\n\n\nThis collaboration helped Tidworth Mums to develop new, creative ways to engage local families and other stakeholders, and build evidence and support for their goal.\n\nThe Mega Soft Play Day created a model that can be used regularly and sustainably and the Mums continue to run activities and remain a valuable asset locally. Our explorations helped the group to realise the value of their own skills and influence and how they could harness that to inform the future of their environment.\n\nThe ongoing collaboration between the Mums, Wiltshire District Council and the Army Welfare Service, has demonstrated the value of relationships, networks and shared objectives.\n\nThe experience of the group has inspired many others and the learning from our project shared across a range of networks and in publications and films (for more on that click on the EXPLORE tab).\n\n\u201cBeing involved in the research has given me new insights into what is meant by \u2018assets\u2019. We used to see these as physical things, such as buildings, but we now recognise that people are assets, and that our group, the Tidworth Mums, is a valuable asset for the community.\u201d\n\u2013 Charlotte Blakemore\n\n\nTidworth Mums: A Case for Soft Play Resource Pack:\nTo support the Mums in their continued efforts, and inspire other groups to mobilise their assets and drive their own future, we created a free resource that shares some of the ideas and activities we used in this project.\n\nCreative Citizens\u2019 Variety Pack: Inspiring Digital Ideas for Community Projects\nThe group\u2019s innovative use of social media to engage and support their community features in this publication by the Royal College of Art, in a case study written by The Glass-House and Tidworth Mums.\n\nFree online course case study:\nIn 2015, we revisited the project and its impact for a film case study to form part of a free online course on FutureLearn:\u00a0Global Systems Science and Policy: An Introduction.
