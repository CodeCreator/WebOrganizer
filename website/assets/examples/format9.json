The restaurant opened in 1786 near Las Ramblas, between Carrer de Ferr\u00e1n and Carrer de La Boquer\u00eda.

Perfectly suiting Can Culleretes' history and tradition are traditional Catalan dishes such as meat or spinach cannelloni with creamed salt cod (brandada de bacalao), a hearty traditional mixed meat stew called escudella con carn d\u2019olla and other homely dishes.\n\n    Location: Carrer d'en Quintana, 5, 08002 Barcelona, Spain\n\n    Open: Tuesday\u2013Saturday from 1.30 pm to 4 pm and from 8 pm to 10.45 pm, Sunday from 1.30 pm to 4 pm (closed on Mondays)\n\n    Phone: +34\u00a0933 17 30 22\n\n\n    photo by Enfo (CC BY-SA 4.0) modified\n\n\n    Casa Delf\u00edn\n\n    Traditional Catalan cuisine from midday to midnight\n\n    Casa Delf\u00edn has combined simplicity and tradition, serving traditional Catalan cuisine in Barcelona for over a century.

        "text":"About these ads\n\nDC Characters In Need of the\u00a0Spotlight\n\n\nTwo years ago DC Comics made a dramatic and controversial movie by rebooting its entire line of comics under the banner of The New 52. The move attracted a whole new audience to their product as they not only made their comics friendly to beginners but also diversified their product with a new focus on; horror, fantasy, and westerns. We are now two years into this new era of the beloved comics publisher and yet there have been many beloved characters who have yet to appear or have shown up only in brief glimpses. These heroes and villains may not have the popularity which comes with having an \u201cS\u201d or a bat on their chest but they do have devoted fanbases who want to see them.\n\nWally West\/The Flash:\u00a0True Barry Allen may be the most iconic speedster to ever put on the red wllywstand yellow, but an entire generation of fanboys (myself included) are for more familiar with his former sidekick, Wally West. Under the famous runs of writers such as; Mark Waid and Geoff Johns we fell in love with West as he grew into his own in the Flash legacy. During\u00a0Flashpoint\u00a0we saw the character die at the hands of his arch nemesis, Captain Cold and since then there has been no sign of him. Out of all the characters in their pantheon, DC must realize that Wally West is the one most fans are clamoring to see.\n\nThe Question:\u00a0Like the Loch Ness Monster and Sasquatch, this mysterious investigator has been sighted in brief glimpses around the dark alleys of the DC Universe lately, hinting that he is part of a larger story at work. Largely ignored throughout most of his time on the printed pages, his appearances in the animated series,\u00a0Justice League Unlimited\u00a0turned the obscure hero into a fan favorite and his final moments in the weekly series,\u00a052, further endeared him to comic fans. Hopefully as the larger story that he seems tied up in grows, we will see the trench coat clad vigilante spouting off his famous eccentricities.\n\nStephanie Brown\/Batgirl\/Spoiler:\u00a0The teenage hero everyone hated, until she took on the mantle of\u00a0Batgirl\u00a0under the pen of\u00a0Bryan Q Miller. Miller succeeded where so many others have failed in showing the readers who Brown was and why we should care about her. Many fans have had a hard time accepting the fact that she is simply gone, just as they had grown attached to her and wish to see her swing across the dark skies of Gotham once again. While few are suggesting that she returns to the\u00a0Batgirl mantle, especially since Gail Simone is blowing everybody away in her current run, perhaps a return to her\u00a0Spoiler\u00a0persona is in order; and given her chemistry with current Batgirl Barbara Gordon perhaps she can take on a fun sidekick role.\n\nBlue_Beetle_by_Miketron2000Ted Kord:\u00a0Before Jaime Reyes, rediscovered the scarab,\u00a0Blue Beetle\u00a0was a geeky underdog who sought to use his resources for justice. Often looked down upon as simply being\u00a0Boost Gold\u2019s\u00a0best bud, their is no doubt that the character had a lot of heart; which he proved in the lead up to the\u00a0Infinite Crisis. With the relatively clean slate the creators at DC now have a return is not outside the realm of possibility. Though the role of Blue Beetle is already filled, Kord is an interesting enough character he can stand on his own out of costume.\n\nJustice League International:\u00a0A series that ended far too early. The positive is that many of the aspects that made this team so beloved have appeared in the new,\u00a0Justice League of America\u00a0series, but it is not the same. Showcasing the best elements of obscure characters such as; Booster Gold, Vixen, Fire, and Ice. The chemistry of the team members along with some great stories endeared them to fans and\u00a0hopefully\u00a0we can see them pop up again soon.\n\nRaven:\u00a0This staple character of the\u00a0Teen Titans\u00a0oozed cool more than any other teen hero in the DC Universe. Originally slated to appear in the current Titans series, plans were changed as DC seems to be positioning her for a grand scale story arc involving her father\u00a0Trigon. But there is no doubt that this new incarnation of the Teen Titans would greatly benefit in the eyes of readers by having this beloved character return to the team. If need be should could easily be seen splitting her time between the Titans and the\u00a0Justice League Dark.\n\nElongated Man & Sue:\u00a0This couple broke fans\u2019 hearts with their tragic arc in\u00a0Identity Crisis\u00a0then later in\u00a052. With fans having gained a new appreciation for this couple it seems to be the perfect time to ralphandsueput them back in the spotlight in this new rebooted version of the DC Universe. With famous couples such as; Lois and Clark and Barry and Iris being split up in the world of the 52; readers are in need of a strong super hero couple. Much like Lois Lane, Sue Dibney is no damsel in distress as she is often seen right alongside her husband and his Justice League cohorts. And Elongated Man having the combination of Batman\u2019s intelligence and resolved paired with Plasitc Man\u2019s powers, would make him a great addition to the super heroes of the DC 52.\n\nRay Palmer\/The Atom:\u00a0True Ray Palmer was in\u00a0Frankenstein Agent of SHADE\u00a0and a woman under the alter ego of\u00a0The Atom\u00a0has recently joined the ranks of the\u00a0Justice League\u00a0it is still not the same.\u00a0I have always had a soft spot for this particular pint sized character. Perhaps he can be recruited by the\u00a0Justice League of America\u00a0for his intellect, which could be a great asset.\n\nIcon & Rocket:\u00a0One of the more remarkable things about the New 52 is how they successfully integrated characters from DC\u2019s other lines of comics into the DC Universe proper. Now we can see a world where Vertigo\u2019s John Constantine and Wildstorm\u2019s Grifter rub elbow\u2019s with Green Lantern; but many comic fans are wondering about the heroes from another line of comics that once stemmed from DC, Milestone. Aside from a brief series starring the ever popular\u00a0Static Shock, the characters from the city of Dakota have been strangely absent. During his run on\u00a0Justice League of America, Milestone co-creator\u00a0Dwayne McDuffie\u00a0proved that his characters could add a lot of excitement in the DCU.\u00a0Icon\u00a0and his sidekick\u00a0Rocket\u00a0were easily the most intriguing characters to come from the era of Milestone Media and would be a welcome edition to the New 52. Seeing how one of the purposes for the reboot was to make their characters more contemporary, this duo could easily bring a great deal of social awareness to comics that could grab headlines as the\u00a0politically\u00a0opposed pair offered up their takes on the world.\n\nI know there are many more heroes and villains fans wish to see return to the pages of DC Comics.

        "text":"The new BBC Three comedy shorts you don't want to miss\n\n\nBBC Three seems a lot funnier now that it's online.\n\nThat might be because it's drawn attention to the lack of good comedy on terrestrial TV, it might be because the move to online has allowed BBC Three to focus its attentions more than before, or it might be because BBC Three has been taking some of the internet's funniest characters and bringing them to a new audience.\n\nThe latest round of the channel's comedy shorts feature West Midland's comedian Guzzy Bear, known for his YouTube presence and hilarious Jurassic World saga last year, and Mandem on the Wall, also known for YouTube sketches and founding the Wall of Comedy. Here's why they're worth 15 minutes of your time.\n\n1. Man Like Mobeen\n\nGuzzy in Man Like Mobeen\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nTaking modern stereotypes of the Asian community and satirising them to within an inch of their life, Man Like Mobeen follows a former road man trying to change his ways and follow the Deen.\n\nCreator Ghulam Khan speaks directly to the viewer, opening with some politically charged statements in his familiar Brummy twang before we witness a day of his life. A day that doesn't end well.\n\nMobeen's former squad won't let him escape his past life so easily, and serious scenes common in communities around the country involving firearms, kidnappings and the like are given a touch of humour.\n\nWhy should you watch it?\n\nIt's often said that TV fails to offer an authentic image of under-represented communities in the UK, because a lot of the time those communities aren't the ones creating the characters. That's not the case with Man Like Mobeen.\n\nThe caricatures Khan creates will be familiar to a lot of people, while others are so left field we can't imagine anyone having a similar direct experience.\n\nAnd despite this episode running just 11 minutes, Khan still managed to create it with a very good soundtrack.\n\n2. JPD\n\nJPD awkward moment helpline sketch\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nThe Mandem on the Wall guys bless us with a series of sketches and parodies, starting with a hilarious vision of Britain's first black swimming relay team that definitely didn't end how we thought it would, and finishing with an incredible parody of Westlife's Flying Without Wings.\n\nJPD is filled with original sketches that will remind you of moments in your own life, albeit some you'd hope to forget.\n\nWhy should you watch it?\n\nThe comedy here feels like the type that's been missing for a while, and a natural successor to Little Miss Jocelyn and The Lenny Henry Show.\n\nBlack comedy doesn't dominate television like it once did. British greats like Desmond's came before Trouble, the defunct channel that offered content nobody has come close to since.\n\nYouTube has changed things slightly, and Mandem on the Wall are a part of that, but the quality of the sketches Jovielle, Percelle and Dee are able to put out is a benefit of collaborating with the BBC.\n\n3. A Brief History Of Tim\n\nTim in A Brief History of Tim\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nTim, a 26-year-old American living with cerebral palsy played by Tim Renkow, is a bit of a dick. He plays cruel pranks on people, is a bit homophobic, and has no qualms about lying about his mother's death. This episode features Tim royally messing up a job interview, not that he cares, and making able-bodied people feel uncomfortable.\n\nWhy should you watch it?\n\nDisabled people, like many other minorities, often suffer from a lack of visibility. A Brief History Of Tim shows a lot of the struggles people with cerebral palsy might go through each day, and this episode seems to particularly highlight a feeling of \"what's the point?\".\n\nBut more than that it does it in a way that shows disabled people are, guess what, just normal people. They can have personality flaws and ugly tendencies like everybody else, or they can be the opposite, like everybody else. It feels like A Brief History of Tim could reduce some of the stigma around how disabled people are perceived - and what better way to do it than with comedy?\n\nLimbo, Fail, and Pumped, all part of this BBC Three series, are also well worth a watch.",

        "text":"Types of Carry On Knife Sheaths, There are many ways in which you can carry your knife. The options depend on your comfort in carrying your knife. But if you are not sure what option you want, below are the other options on how people carry their knife around while concealing it to the public. Read the options in order to help you choose.\n\ntypes of carry on knife sheats\n\n1. Carry on Your Neck\n\nThe latest trend now is carrying your knife around your neck. Most of the knife carried around the neck is lightweight and has around 3 inches blade. The sheath of your knife is attached to a ball chain or a paracord which makes it simple to slip your knife on and off your neck. But this kind of carry on option has its own pros and cons to deal with.\n\nAlso read: How to Choose A Pocket knife?\n\nThe first con is carrying a sharp object where your heart and lungs are near. Do you think it is practical or safe? You might get caught into an accident. The pro on carrying your knife around the neck is you can conceal it from the public. You can hide the knife under your shirt and people won\u2019t notice you are carrying it around.\n\nBefore you select this option, make sure you weigh the pros and cons. In this way, you won\u2019t waste your money. It might be the best way to carry your knife but it does not mean its good for everyone.\n\n2. Clip on Your Pants or Shorts\n\nUsing belt sheaths are also popular because it is easy to put and carry around. But in case you don\u2019t have a belt, what will you do to attach your sheath? You can have the option in carrying your knife on your pocket. But if the knife is too big, this cannot be the option. During emergency option where you require your knife with you, there should be an alternative option to carry your knife around your pants without the belt.\n\nThe best way to do it is a clip or a belt loop. But the clip is the best way to conceal your knife while carrying it on your side. It is easy to put by just clipping it and you are ready to go.\n\n3. Attached on Your Bra\n\nFor women, the best way to conceal a knife is attaching it to your bra. It\u2019s the best way for a woman to be armed in public without others knowing she is carrying something. But this option is best rather than the neck sheath. Why? The knife is not allowed to move while the carrier is moving around, even when you are running. It will be in the same position throughout the day you are carrying the knife while concealing the weapon from others.\n\n4. Wear it Like an ID\n\nIf your knife is tiny, this might be a good option. A badge sheath is like a fancy badge ID that most teachers or health professionals carry. This badge is exceptional as it carries your knife. The best thing about this option is you can carry it easily and anytime but only with a small knife\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here",

        "text":"4 Reasons To Get Braces For Crowded Teeth\n\n2 February 2017\n\u00a0Categories: Dentist, Blog\n\n\nWhen you have a mouth full of crowded teeth, they can cause problems in numerous ways. It is wise to get the teeth repaired before you end up with dental problems that are more severe. Braces are an effective method for helping crowded teeth move further apart. You will also find that braces are beneficial in a few other ways concerning your dental health as well. Take a look at the information in this article to gain more insight about braces.\n\n1. Chewing Food Will Be Less Painful\n\nIt can be painful to chew food when you have crowded teeth in your mouth. The pain stems from having to chew food in a certain way, especially if there is a large amount of crowding. Improper chewing also puts more stress on your jawbones, which is another cause of the pain. Braces can resolve the problem and make eating a more pleasant experience.\n\n2. There Will Be a Smaller Risk for Gum Disease\n\nWhen teeth are crowding, brushing them can be a complicated task. The closeness and uneven way the teeth are situated in your gums makes it hard for a toothbrush to reach every small space. You end up with plaque being left on your teeth, which can eventually lead to gum disease. Brushing can be done more thoroughly after your teeth are corrected with braces.\n\n3. You Can Opt for Clear Aligners or Metal Braces\n\nThere is more than one option for braces that you can choose from. If you don't mind metal being placed on your teeth, metal braces might work for you. Just make sure to thoroughly clean the braces after they are installed to prevent food from getting stuck in them. You also have the option of wearing clear Invisalign aligners, which does the same job as metal braces. The aligners can be removed when you are eating food, but must be worn for the majority of each day.\n\n4. Teeth Will Experience Wear in an Even Manner\n\nYou must understand that crowded and uneven teeth lead to some of them being used more than others. The teeth that are used the most become worn out a lot faster than those that are hardly used. You can experience more dental issues when teeth do not wear in an even manner. Speak to an orthodontist, such as John C. Matunas D.D.S., PA,\u00a0to get examined so you will know if braces are right for correcting your crowded teeth.",

        "text":"7 surprising freedoms we enjoy in Britain\n\nIn an age when Theresa May seems determined to read every email you write, abolish human rights and arrest everyone on terror charges, it can feel like our freedoms are under threat (they are). However, on a more positive note, we British people enjoy some freedoms that a lot of the world does not.\n\nNothing on this list will be a surprise to you. However, what I think will be a surprise, is that the rest of the world does not have these freedoms. These are things we take for granted but are not always the norm.\n\nNaming your child\n\nIn Britain, you can name a baby anything as long as the powers that be do not label it as offensive or rude. People take liberal advantage of this, regularly naming their babies after TV characters, inanimate objects or obviously incorrect spellings of real names.\n\nThis is not a freedom most of Europe enjoys: many countries have set lists of accepted names. You have to pick from the list and you cannot change the spelling.\n\n\nOnly wacky religious people tend to homeschool. However, you do have the option if you so wish. If you are tired of the school forcing facts down your child\u2019s throat, you can pretend to be a teacher and give them an education yourself. You will seriously damage the child\u2019s intellectual and social skills, but at least you will feel better.\n\nWe and around half the countries in the world enjoy this freedom. Each country has different levels of restrictions. For the rest of the world, homeschooling is illegal.\n\n\nAt some point in the history of the United States, the government and the people had the following conversation:\n\nGovernment: \u201cCan we take away some of the really big guns so that children stop getting massacred?\u201d\nPeople: \u201cNo! Keep your hands off our second amendment!\u201d\nGovernment: \u201cOkay. Can we make it illegal to cross the street wherever you want?\u201d\nPeople: \u201cSure, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nIt seems a bizarre way round to me. I like living in a culture where assault rifles are not allowed, but crossing an empty street when it is safe to do so is. But what do I know as a humble British person?\n\nGermany also criminalises jaywalking. There is something odd about watching clearly inebriated Germans stumbling home, yet stopping at every crossing to wait for the green man.\n\nMoving house without telling everyone\n\nDo you find junk mail annoying? I do. When I move house, I do not want everyone to know that I have moved. I will tell the people I think are worthy of knowing: banks, utility companies, etc. For everyone else, I do not want your nuisance mail.\n\nIn Finland, when you move house, you tell the state. The state then tells everyone else. This is convenient because it means all of your banks know that you have moved house. However, what if you do not want to tell a bunch of for-profit companies about your new address?\n\nFree healthcare, including birth control\n\nWe tend to think of free healthcare as something that all civilised countries have, with the notable exception of the United States. However, this is not always the case. Take Finland again, for example.\n\nWhen you go into hospital, there is a charge per day. It is not the full cost of your hospital stay, but it is not insignificant. You also pay to visit your GP and pay higher prescription charges. For birth control, for example, you will be paying around \u20ac15 per month.\n\nIn the UK, we pay for prescriptions (not in Scotland or Wales) and dental, but these are both capped at relatively low amounts. Hospital treatment is without cost entirely (unless you want to watch the TV).\n\nID cards\n\nCompulsory ID cards are overwhelmingly the norm. Britain is one of only nine countries[ref] in the world that does not have any ID cards.\n\nFlag burning\n\nFlag desecration varies by countries. In many, it is illegal. In some, it is prosecuted under wider laws.\n\nIn the UK, we are pretty relaxed about it. If you want to burn the Union Jack, feel free. There is no law against it. There have been some moves to tighten up on it, but none have come to fruition.\n\nOf course, you may struggle if it is made of fire-resistant material. As this EU flag was, for example:\n\n\nFree newsletter\n\nDon't have time to check my blog? Get a weekly email with all the new posts. This is my personal blog, so obviously it is 100% spam free.\n\n\nTags: , , ,\n\nThis entry was posted on Monday, February 20th, 2017 at 11:00 am and is filed under Religion & Politics.
