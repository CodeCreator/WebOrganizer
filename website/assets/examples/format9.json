Hundreds of families made their way to Don Fox Park on Tuesday for the event. Beth Petty, Lebanon Special School District family resource center coordinator, said hundreds of families enjoyed the festivities, which included free food, books and music, as well as appearances from local emergency service agencies.

The decommissioned bus was refurbished and fitted with a serving area and six tables with the ability to seat 24 people.This year, the district\u2019s summer food program greatly expanded. Starting week three, the district served 250-300 meals per day.\u00a0\n\nThumbs up to Rev. Matt Steinhauer, of Faith Lutheran Church, for joining the health care fight. The Lebanon reverend was among a handful of Middle Tennessee-area clergy members who made their way to Nashville on Wednesday to help advocate for citizens who could be harmed by potential national healthcare changes. Steinhauer joined other clergy members, the Alliance for Health Care Security and the Moral Movement Tennessee for an Interfaith Day of Action to protect healthcare coverage for Tennesseans.\n\nThumbs up to the Dewaal family and their annual Dewall Shoe Giveaway, an event that will see needy children receive a free pair of shoes, as well as socks and underwear.

        "text":"The Daily Mail: 6 things you must do in Croatia\n\nThe Daily Mail has recently compiled a list of six things you must not miss while visiting Croatia.\n\nCroatia is poised to become one of the most popular short-haul destinations of the year. Lonely Planet tagged its coastal region of Istria as one of its top visits for 2011, and that\u2019s only one of many stops in this inexpensive, outside-the-eurozone country.\n\nHere\u2019s our list of things to do and see, including traditional toy-making, a sea and sun-powered music and light show, ancient Greek fields, Roman marvels and lighthouse stays on remote islands. Not to mention 1,000 miles of rocky coves and pine-fringed beaches.\n\n1 Within these walls\n\nOne US website recently named Dubrovnik the third most romantic place in the world, after Buenos Aires and Bora Bora, but ahead of Paris and Venice. This handsome \u2018city of stone and light\u2019, between the Adriatic and the Dinaric Alps, was pounded during the Balkan war of the Nineties.\n\nRestorers pieced it together almost to the state of its glory days: the newer orange terracotta tiles are the only real clue as to where the bombs fell. The well preserved, mile-long 14th Century ramparts are among the finest in Europe. The pedestrian-only old town within is full of medieval, renaissance and baroque treasures, as well as designer shops, restaurants and galleries. Read More.",

        "text":"The new BBC Three comedy shorts you don't want to miss\n\n\nBBC Three seems a lot funnier now that it's online.\n\nThat might be because it's drawn attention to the lack of good comedy on terrestrial TV, it might be because the move to online has allowed BBC Three to focus its attentions more than before, or it might be because BBC Three has been taking some of the internet's funniest characters and bringing them to a new audience.\n\nThe latest round of the channel's comedy shorts feature West Midland's comedian Guzzy Bear, known for his YouTube presence and hilarious Jurassic World saga last year, and Mandem on the Wall, also known for YouTube sketches and founding the Wall of Comedy. Here's why they're worth 15 minutes of your time.\n\n1. Man Like Mobeen\n\nGuzzy in Man Like Mobeen\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nTaking modern stereotypes of the Asian community and satirising them to within an inch of their life, Man Like Mobeen follows a former road man trying to change his ways and follow the Deen.\n\nCreator Ghulam Khan speaks directly to the viewer, opening with some politically charged statements in his familiar Brummy twang before we witness a day of his life. A day that doesn't end well.\n\nMobeen's former squad won't let him escape his past life so easily, and serious scenes common in communities around the country involving firearms, kidnappings and the like are given a touch of humour.\n\nWhy should you watch it?\n\nIt's often said that TV fails to offer an authentic image of under-represented communities in the UK, because a lot of the time those communities aren't the ones creating the characters. That's not the case with Man Like Mobeen.\n\nThe caricatures Khan creates will be familiar to a lot of people, while others are so left field we can't imagine anyone having a similar direct experience.\n\nAnd despite this episode running just 11 minutes, Khan still managed to create it with a very good soundtrack.\n\n2. JPD\n\nJPD awkward moment helpline sketch\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nThe Mandem on the Wall guys bless us with a series of sketches and parodies, starting with a hilarious vision of Britain's first black swimming relay team that definitely didn't end how we thought it would, and finishing with an incredible parody of Westlife's Flying Without Wings.\n\nJPD is filled with original sketches that will remind you of moments in your own life, albeit some you'd hope to forget.\n\nWhy should you watch it?\n\nThe comedy here feels like the type that's been missing for a while, and a natural successor to Little Miss Jocelyn and The Lenny Henry Show.\n\nBlack comedy doesn't dominate television like it once did. British greats like Desmond's came before Trouble, the defunct channel that offered content nobody has come close to since.\n\nYouTube has changed things slightly, and Mandem on the Wall are a part of that, but the quality of the sketches Jovielle, Percelle and Dee are able to put out is a benefit of collaborating with the BBC.\n\n3. A Brief History Of Tim\n\nTim in A Brief History of Tim\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nTim, a 26-year-old American living with cerebral palsy played by Tim Renkow, is a bit of a dick. He plays cruel pranks on people, is a bit homophobic, and has no qualms about lying about his mother's death. This episode features Tim royally messing up a job interview, not that he cares, and making able-bodied people feel uncomfortable.\n\nWhy should you watch it?\n\nDisabled people, like many other minorities, often suffer from a lack of visibility. A Brief History Of Tim shows a lot of the struggles people with cerebral palsy might go through each day, and this episode seems to particularly highlight a feeling of \"what's the point?\".\n\nBut more than that it does it in a way that shows disabled people are, guess what, just normal people. They can have personality flaws and ugly tendencies like everybody else, or they can be the opposite, like everybody else. It feels like A Brief History of Tim could reduce some of the stigma around how disabled people are perceived - and what better way to do it than with comedy?\n\nLimbo, Fail, and Pumped, all part of this BBC Three series, are also well worth a watch.",

        "text":"Crowdfunding platforms: what are my options?\n\nCrowdfunding platforms can be pretty confusing, right? There\u2019s lots of them, and they all offer different things. Because of this, it can be difficult to know which crowdfunding platform is right for your startup. But the right information can make a world of difference. In this article, we\u2019ll talk you through 5 different crowdfunding platforms and what you can expect from them: Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Crowdcube, Crowdfunder and Crowd Supply. We\u2019ll cover their pros and cons and how well each crowdfunding platform caters to startups.\n\n\nLogo for crowdfunding platform Kickstarter\n\nKickstarter\u2019s the biggest name in crowdfunding, and the crowdfunding platform behind massive successes like Pebble. The fact it\u2019s so well-known is definitely in its favour \u2013 journalists are more likely to peruse Kickstarter for stories (which means free PR for you) and on top of that, it just gets more traffic. Since its inception back in 2009, there have been\u00a0124,813 successful projects on Kickstarter.\n\nDespite this, it\u2019s not always the best option for a startup. For one, Kickstarter funds specific, creative projects.\u00a0That means there\u2019s got to be an end product or experience in mind:\n\nEverything on Kickstarter must be a project. A project has a clear goal, like making an album, a book, a gadget, or a work of art. A project will eventually be completed, and something will be produced by it.\n\nThis means it\u2019s not often\u00a0suitable for web startups. However, if your startup is working towards a specific project \u2013 for example, if you\u2019re a tech startup who design\u00a03D printers \u2013 you can use Kickstarter.\n\nThere are other things to bear in mind too. Kickstarter use an\u00a0all or nothing\u00a0system of crowdfunding. This means that if you don\u2019t raise your full target, you won\u2019t get anything. That said, this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. If the funds were still released when the target wasn\u2019t met, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019d have enough money to fulfil your promises to your backers anyway. Plus, if you don\u2019t raise enough money, you won\u2019t be charged anything by the platform.\n\nBut what about if you do raise enough? What sort of fees are you looking at for using the platform? Kickstarter take 5% commission from the total raised, as well as payment processing fees. These processing fees vary depending on where you live, but generally are about 3-5%.\n\nSpeaking of location, you will have to check you\u2019re eligible to post a project on Kickstarter. You\u2019re eligible\u00a0to put up a project on Kickstarter if you live in any of these countries:\u00a0US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, France, Spain,\u00a0Italy, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Mexico.\n\n> Read our guide on setting up a Kickstarter campaign.\n\n\n\nLogo for crowdfunding platform Indiegogo\n\nIndiegogo markets itself as a more democratised crowdfunding platform, and this means it\u2019s a bit more flexible than Kickstarter. You can fundraise for pretty much anything, whether it\u2019s an entrepreneurial project or a personal cause. You can also set a longer deadline than Kickstarter allows. Plus, it\u2019s available in all countries where PayPal can be used.\n\nIndiegogo also\u00a0offers different funding options. You can choose fixed funding or flexible funding. Fixed is like Kickstarter\u2019s system \u2013 you only get the money if you raise the full amount. Flexible funding lets you have any money you raise \u2013 but as we said earlier, this isn\u2019t always a good idea if you\u2019ve calculated a specific amount for specific reasons. Flexible funding is better suited for charitable and personal fundraising, where any amount will help.\n\nProjects are also automatically sorted on Indiegogo, while on Kickstarter there\u2019s an element of manual curation from the staff. This, again, is part of their effort to make the crowdfunding system more democratic. They call the algorithm that does this the Gogofactor:\n\nThe gogofactor is an algorithm that helps campaigns achieve greater visibility on\u2014and reach audiences who may find them interesting.\n\nThe gogofactor is influenced by several aspects, including the scope of a campaign\u2019s social engagement (such as Facebook likes and shares), and global reach.\n\nDepending on payment method, Indiegogo\u2019s fees vary between a total of 8-10% (including processing.) These are similar to Kickstarter\u2019s and are pretty standard across the board.\n\nCompared to Kickstarter, Indiegogo has a much smaller audience and much less press coverage. Although Indiegogo\u2019s been around longer, there have been fewer successful projects and they only have about one sixth of the userbase of Kickstarter. This means journalists are less likely to notice an Indiegogo campaign, meaning it can be harder to create a buzz that way. That doesn\u2019t mean you should disregard them though. Their flexibility is a big boon in their favour, especially given that you have more options in what you can fundraise for. This is good for startups, as it means you can use the money to cover some more general set-up costs. You can also set up a campaign without having to wait for Indiegogo to review it.\n\n\nLogo for crowdfunding platform Crowdcube\n\nCrowdcube is a UK based equity crowdfunding platform. This means it works differently to Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which work on a rewards system. A rewards system is where backers receive a something specific\u00a0in exchange for backing the product. Equity crowdfunding means the backer is directly investing in the company in exchange for shares:\n\nCrowdcube is the world\u2019s first and leading investment crowdfunding platform, where a community of like\u00adminded people pool their money and knowledge together to back startup, early and growth stage businesses. Crowdcube gives everyone the opportunity to become \u2018armchair Dragons\u2019, building upon their own investment portfolio and supporting British businesses.\n\nThis is closer to traditional funding methods, such as angel investing and venture capitalism. However, you\u2019re opening it up to the general public \u2013 backers on Crowdcube can invest as little as \u00a310. This does mean you\u2019re losing one of the main benefits of crowdfunding \u2013 the fact that you don\u2019t have to surrender equity. On the other hand, it also means you\u2019ve got more flexibility in how you use the investment and don\u2019t have to worry about rewards. Creating and distributing rewards can be both costly and time-consuming. Plus, if you don\u2019t want hundreds of investors on your share register, they offer a \u2018nominee\u2019 system:\n\nWith a nominee, Crowdcube holds and is the legal owner of the investment on behalf of your investors so you have only one legal shareholder on your share register.\n\nAlternatively, their direct system means everyone who backs you will be a legal shareholder. This has the advantage of building a closer relationship with your backers.\n\nThey\u2019re very well established, owning about 50% of the UK market. Unlike rewards-based systems, their specific focus is on funding startups, which means they\u2019re very fit for purpose. For instance, they\u2019ve got stringent due diligence processes\u00a0built into their platform. As part of this, they offer a lot of guidance\u00a0on using their platform. And they have FSA approval, so are a safe bet.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, like Kickstarter, they offer an\u00a0all or nothing\u00a0model. Money is only taking from investors when the goal is reached. Their success rate is pretty stellar though, with 60% of campaigns successful. In terms of fees, they charge 7% commission on the funds raised, plus Stripe payment processing fees.\n\n> If you\u2019re in the USA, offers a similar service.\u00a0It\u2019s worth noting the USA has stricter rules about accredited investors, so it\u2019s not quite the same as crowdfunding from the general public.\n\nLogo for crowdfunding platform Crowdfunder\n\nThis is another UK-based crowdfunding platform. In many ways, it\u2019s not too different to Kickstarter or Indiegogo. You set up a project asking for backers, in return for rewards. With Crowdfunder, you also have the option to just ask for donations without a reward. They say their funding model is great for startups:\n\n\u201cYou could be a community group, a start-up, a great cause, a charity or an organisation in need of some funding.\u201d\n\nA big perk on Crowdfunder is the fact they have additional funding available. As well as the money you raise from \u2018The Crowd\u2019, you could also be eligible for extra pledges of up to \u00a310,000 from \u2018The Funders\u2019. These Funders tend to be government bodies and banks who are offering grants to support startups. It\u2019s definitely not something be sniffed at!\n\nLike Indiegogo, you have a choice between \u2018all or nothing\u2018 or \u2018keep what you raise\u2018. The same warning applies \u2013 make sure that if you choose to keep what you raise, you\u2019ll still be able to give your backers what you\u2019ve promised them. They have the same fees for both systems \u2013 5% + VAT + payment processing fees.\n\nCrowd Supply\n\nLogo for crowdfunding platform Crowdsupply\n\nCrowd Supply is an another\u00a0crowdfunding platform, but they\u2019re pretty strict about who they allow to use them. They support\u00a0original, useful\u00a0and\u00a0respectful\u00a0hardware. So basically, they cater more for the new gadget side of crowdfunding. But if you fit into this criteria, they\u2019re a fantastic option with some seriously impressive success rates. So far, 58% of projects have been successful. Even more\u00a0impressively, 100% of fully funded projects have been delivered to backers. This is because they take a hands-on approach and help with the fulfilment process, including shipping products out of their own warehouse. This commitment to helping with shipping can really simplify the later stages of a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nThey offer a number of plans, with varying levels of guidance. Their fees vary depending on which you choose:\n\nSo now you\u2019ve picked your platform, it\u2019s time to get your campaign going. Read our ultimate checklist on everything you\u2019ll need to crowdfund your startup.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBecca is the Marketing Executive at... (truncated)",
