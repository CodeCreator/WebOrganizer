        "text":"Experimenting with the Square Format: Using the Spartus Full-Vue With Tungsten Film\n\nmasked spartus\n\n\u00a0The Spartus Full-Vue Twin Lens Camera, 1948-1960.\n\nThe Twin Lens Reflex Camera:\n\nMany notable photographers used twin lens cameras: Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, Lisette Model, and Diane Arbus.\u00a0The first twin lens reflex camera appeared in 1880 as a specially built camera for the Kew Observatory in England. The first production twin lens camera appeared in the 1882, introduced as the Academy\u00a0by the British firm, Marion and Company.\u00a0 The camera, a non-reflex design featured an upper viewing lens held at eye level, and produced the distinctive square image that would come to be associated with twin lens cameras. \u00a0Over the next two decades, nearly every major camera manufacturer offered twin lens reflex cameras standardized on the square format.\u00a0[1]\n\n\nTwin lens reflex cameras feature a mirror mounted behind the viewing lens at a 45-degree angle, reflecting light onto the viewing screen. The upper lens is dedicated to viewing and is mechanically synchronized for focus with the lower lens, which is devoted to film exposure. Usually held at waist level to compose and focus, the twin lens reflex camera offers the advantage of a viewing area identical to the exposure area. Twin lens cameras also offer the advantages of being able to view the exposure as it is being made. In addition, the mirror does not have to move to made the exposure. Traditionally the square format negative was cropped to 8\u00d710 inches, the standard paper size. The large negative of the typical twin lens camera, over 4 times the size of the 35mm camera format, presents advantages for enlargement of selected portions of the image without significant loss of detail. The disadvantages of the twin lens design are the slight disparity between the coverage area of the upper and lower lens, referred as parallax error, and a right to left reversal produced by the mirrored image.\n\n\nThe Square Format:\n\nIn painting and photography, the shape of the picture refers to picture\u2019s format.\u00a0 Because rectangles are so prevalent in our daily lives, we seldom notice the shape of the window, table or the pages of a book. Most paintings and photographs are rectangles. The horizontal or vertical format of the rectangle may evoke the breadth of a landscape or the heights of towering mountains. The compositional flexibility of the rectangle helps to make the format ubiquitous. Invisible to the shape of picture, we notice content of the picture rather and shape of the picture.[2]\n\n\nSince very few subjects are naturally square, photographers using the square format cameras often crop their images into rectangles. However, photographers who make the syntactical decision to use \u00a0the square format do so in support of subject and content decisions, and alerts us that each photograph is a means of representing the world. \u00a0Using a square format camera without cropping the image can enliven subject matter by making the photographer and viewer conscious of the shape of the picture and act of taking a photograph. The square format counters the invisibility of the rectangle, and demands that we consider the shape of the picture as well as what is depicted within the shape. The square format presents a fresh challenge to the traditional golden rectangle variants found in most camera viewfinders.\n\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe Spartus Full-Vue Twin Lens Reflex- the Spartus Camera Corporation in Chicago, Illinois, produced the Full-Vue Reflex from 1948-1960. The camera is a simple to use twin-lens reflex box camera featuring an image in the ground glass viewfinder equal to the negative size. With a large viewing lens the Full-Vue boasts an especially bright viewfinder image.In 1949, the Full-Vue \u00a0also featured a synchronized flash attachment.\u00a0The Spartus Full-Vue\u2019s bakelite body [3]\u00a0is fitted with a fixed focus 92mm Scienar plastic lens and takes twelve 6-centimeter exposures on 120mm film. The Spartus Full-Vue employs a rotary shutter\u00a0and as the Full-Vue manual instructs \u201cthe exposure is then made by gently pressing the exposure lever down as far as it will go.\u201d[4]\u00a0The shutter has only two settings: \u201cinst.\u201d (about 1\/60th of a second) and \u201ctime\u201d (a bulb setting for long exposures).\u00a0\n\n\nUsing the Spartus Full-Vue With Tungsten Film in Daylight:\n\nI loaded Fujichrome T64 Professional 120mm Tungsten film into the Spartus Full View, and used the camera to photograph fall color at three California locations in late October, 2013: in the Alder Grove at Yosemite National Park, along the Tenaya Canyon Creek just outside of Lee Vinning on in the Eastern Sierra and at North Bloomfield in the Nevada County. Tungsten films are calibrated for exposure under indoor studio lighting conditions with a Kevin temperature of 3200k producing a much lower color temperature than daylight, which has a Kelvin temperate of 5500k. When shooting tungsten film in daylight conditions, a 85 filter\u00a0compensates for color temperature disparity and when shooting daylight films in tungsten light conditions, an 80a filter is recommend.[5] Using tungsten film in daylight conditions without color correction filters yields unpredictable results and even with identical exposures on the same roll of film.\n\n\nAt each location, I photographed in basic daylight conditions, and exposed the Fujichrome T64 Tungsten film without color correction and without any using a color correction filter. The Full-Vue\u2019s plastic lens produced spectacularly unpredictable results. The appearance of the monochrome reds was surprising, and the deep blues and magentas produced startling mixes of color. The square format of the Spartus Full-Vue supports the muting of image details in the abstraction of unexpected color.\n\n\u00a9David Arnold, 2014.\n\n\n\n[1] S. F.

The great Jose Romanillos invites you into his shop while he makes a guitar and talks about the craft. Jos\u00e9 Luis Romanillos Vega was born in Madrid in 1932 where he learnt the craft of cabinet making from the age of thirteen. He moved to England in 1956 to work in psychiatric hospitals in Epsom and North London. He made his first guitar in London in 1961 and in 1970 he moved to Semley, Wiltshire, where he began his professional career as a guitar maker encouraged by Julian Bream, who played Jose L. Romanillos guitars for many years. In 1987 he published the biography of Antonio de Torres, the first book written about a Spanish guitar maker. He has lectured on the history of the Spanish guitar as well as giving courses in many countries on the development and construction of the Spanish guitar. Although he has retired from guitar making he keeps in close contact with his son Liam Romanillos who continues with the family tradition in Gillingham, Dorset. He has settled in Guijosa, Spain, where since 2001 he has organised, with his son Liam, a course on Spanish guitar making.

        "text":"GAST: Dale Fearnley and Laura Mahony, Lincoln\n\nHome is where the heart is, and artists Dale Fearnley and Laura Mahony have opened theirs to the outside world. A collaborative project with Ian Malicom, GAST is a unique exhibition situated inside the couple\u2019s home and includes film, sculpture, installation and most interestingly, live performance.\n\nFearnley, Mahony and Malicom are all members of General Practice, a collective created by graduates from the University of Lincoln. Their aim is to encourage more creativity in the city and to create a student led art scene similar to that of Nottingham.\n\nOnce you walk through the front door of the small terraced house, a white sheet leads you down a hallway into the dining room. The mismatched chairs surrounding the table point towards an unusual and disturbing scene. A women in a white dress lies facedown into a plate of spaghetti, her blonde curls merging with the strands until it is hard to see where one ends and the other begins.\n\nThis is actually a performance by Mahony that is drawn from her childhood experiences. Her impressive stillness is overpowering, she draws you in and keeps you captivated without ever moving a muscle. How long will she stay this way? Fearnley, a sculptor who for tonight is acting as a guide, informs me the performance will last until the end of the show; and there\u2019s still another two and a half hours left to go.\n\nMalicom also works with performance. Using a 1930s style radio, he transmits unintelligible noise from an upstairs bedroom to the living room. The unsettling chatter of the radio combined with the draft coming through the cling film covered window creates a sense of desertion. As though this is a house long abandoned.\n\nSurprises are around every corner and all of the space is well utilised. Even the bathroom holds sculptural pieces, including a run-down chair directly opposite the toilet, possibly the perfect way to make anybody uncomfortable in a homely setting.\n\nThe influence of surrealism is evident. Under the stairs hang bowler hats next to a pile of apples and a pipe reminiscent of Magritte\u2019s The Treachery of Images. Considering you\u2019re meant to decide for yourself whether the objects scattered around are art works or household items this is the perfect metaphor.\n\nBut what is the reasoning behind all of this confusion? The answer is actually rather clear cut. The artists want you to reconsider the place you call your safe haven, and to ponder the nuclear family and Stepford ideal.\n\nAlthough they partly chose this setting for budgetary reasons, Fearnley and Mahony have successfully made their everyday home into a surreal work of art. The building retains the essence of those who have moved on, and the memories left behind. General Practice have harnessed this and turned it into a comment on our perception of home and family life; we cannot possibly know what goes on behind closed doors. If this is the future of art in Lincoln, then it is a promising future indeed.\n\nSophie Lloyd\n\nGAST took place on 20 March at the artists\u2019 home in Lincoln and ran as part of a series of exhibitions called Re>fer>al, the next one is 10 June.
