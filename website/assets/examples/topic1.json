After some debating, they decided that her friend was going to be an artist, and she was going to be a gallery\u2026 What? A gallery? \u00a0What happened to a doggies or clowns!\u00a0\n\nSo, I do what I always do when confronted with a crafting dilemma\u2026 Or any dilemma for that matter\u2026 Google it! Or if that doesn\u2019t work, try Pinterest. (Sometimes in the reverse order) but the only ideas I could find were costumes that were actual paintings, which were really cool, like the one below, but not what she had envisioned.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to be just one piece of art, she wanted to be the whole gallery! So, we started at fabric land and bought some gold leather-like fabric that we thought would work well to make picture frames.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe cut out a bunch of frames in various sizes. Then, we cut some white rectangles to go inside of the frames. We ended up using some white leather scraps, and sharpies. She took the white squares into school and had a few of her friends design the pieces of art. Then we glued the artwork inside the frames. Here is what they looked like laid out on our kitchen floor.\n\nAnd here is what Sam looked like laid out on our kitchen floor. Lol. \u00a0We used the same gold leather to cut out letters spelling \u201cart gallery\u201d and we wanted the make sure they were spaced out evenly so we put a dab of hot glue on each letter to hold them in place.\n\n\nWe also tacked down all of the artwork with a drop of hot glue. We wanted to make sure they were all appropriately placed, which was why we did it when she was wearing it as opposed to just laying it on the floor.\n\nWe did exactly the same thing to the pants. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThen we decided that the back needed something, so we cut out and added some more letters.\n\nShe took off the shirt and pants and we glued around each frame and letter.\n\nThis is what she looked like on her way out to go trick-or-treating. We added a couple frames on her cheeks with face paint.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd here is her and Dylan\u2026\u00a0\n\nI think it turned out well. The hardest part was coming up with the idea! But, she was happy, and that is the most important part. Im upset that I forgot to take a picture of her and her friend together in their costumes! I don\u2019t know if you can tell by the looks on their faces, but they really weren\u2019t that excited about making their friends wait for them to go trick-or-treating until I took a few photos\u2026just wait until I tell them that I want a photo with Santa again this year!\u00a0\n\nI know this post is a little late, but better late than never right? I\u2019m just thinking of it as being really early for next year! \u00a0It has been a crazy couple of months, and I have lots of posts to catch up on!\u00a0\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

The painting was originally among the works selected by the Obamas to hang in the White House, but was returned - either due to the controversy or because it really didn't match the sofa. The reasons really are inconsequential. What is of interest are the heated debates over the differences between tribute art and outright theft of concept and\/or visuals.\n\nIt is true that art imitates life. It is also true that in one way, shape, or form, art also imitates art. It can't be helped. Artists ARE influenced in their ideas and their forms of expression.\n\nPicasso said \"the bad artists imitate, the great artists steal.\"\nIn other words, to steal an idea you have to own it and make it your own.\nTo imitate, you merely need to copy it and put nothing of yourself into it.\n\nOn one hand, Alma's \"Watusi\" is an almost exact replica of Matisse's \"L'escargot\" with palette changed and shapes rearranged. On the other hand, it is well documented that Alma created the painting as a tribute, using it as a study of Matisse's techniques. She never hid the fact that it was directly influenced. Furthermore, her study of this particular work was apparently a turning point in her art. Everything that followed reflected the impact of Matisse on her paintings\/concepts\/approach. As Tilly Greene remarked yesterday, it would have been MORE interesting to see Alma take the influence to another level, rather than just remake Matisse's composition. But it should be duly noted that Alma probably had no idea that her painting would one day hang in the Hirshhorn Museum and be considered one of the great works of American art.\n\nI've often wondered if Picasso and Matisse would roll over in their graves knowing that their napkin drawings are considered fine works of art. Nawwww - Picasso would love it, the arrogant old bastard!\n\nThe major difference between plagiarism and tribute seems to be credit given where credit is due. Trying to pass off copies of someone else's original concepts and work as your own is plagiarism, pure and simple. Utilizing the ideas and visuals of a \"master\" artist to create something new, or to study technique is tribute. All art is an imitation in one form or another, whether it is an imitation of something seen or an expression of an idea born within the mind of the artist. It is the process of communicating the ideas, the visions, the exploration that creates the art in whatever genre the artist chooses to express themselves in.\n\nDoes Watusi deserve to be considered a great work of art, given that it is a tribute piece? It depends on who you talk to. Personally I think it is confusing and blurs the already subjective lines of what constitutes \"masterful\" art - art that rates hanging in the top museums of the world. Does Alma Thomas deserve the scathing disregard for her work that is currently being bandied about? Absolutely not. However, on the bright side - more people now know her name and have looked at her paintings. Bad P.R. is better than no P.R. type thing.\n\nArt is once again the heated topic of discussion - replacing whatever was on television last night as the topic of choice.\nWell, for some people anyway.\n\nTuesday, November 10, 2009\n\nDAMage Research - Plagarism or Tribute?\n\nThe 1963 painting by Alma Thomas (to the right) is extremely similar to a 1953 piece by Matisse (below).\n\nit would be interesting to find out what the Hirshhorn Museum paid for Watusi.\n\nThomas's painting was first exhibited in the '60s. At that time, you could no more plagiarize a Matisse collage such as \"The Snail\" than you could pass off the \"Mona Lisa\" as your own.\n\nElaborations on earlier artists' work, even full appropriation, have been common practice in art for hundreds of years. Artists long learned their craft by copying the works of older masters; even among high artists, it was standard.\n\nthe 73-year-old artist found herself staring at the hollyhock shadows she had known her entire life and calculating\n\nhow to use them in her paintings. A year earlier, she had seen the late Matisse cutouts at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Matisse's work had prompted her to paint an acrylic-on-canvas version of his collage The Snail (1953), in which nearly all the original colors were reversed. Thomas named her painting Watusi (Hard Edge), after Chubby Checker's dance hit \"The Watusi.\" As well as marrying high modernism with the popular culture of black America--then entering the American mainstream--the title she chose noted Matisse's debt to African art.\n\nPablo Picasso that, \"the bad artists imitate, the great artists steal.\" Thomas' work here is a transformation of the Matisse painting. There is power in the decision to reverse colors and to change perspective from \"L'escargot,\"giving \"Watusi\" integrity to stand on its own as a distinctive piece.\n\n\nillegitimate copying is real. Both Richard Prince (See VR\u2019s \u201cPrince of Pilfer\u201d) and Jeff Koons have been sued by photographers for incorporating copyrighted work into their own. Koons lost the Rogers v. Koons case, but won a more recent suit under the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine. Readers will remember that earlier this year Damien Hirst threatened to sue a 16-year-old over his use of an image of Hirst\u2019s diamond-incrusted skull, in the process demanding royalties.\n\nThomas always credited Matisse for the inspiration that produced Watusi. It is obvious that the work launched her on a journey of artistic discovery that produced her unique and forward-looking (if not radical) mosaic style.\n\nTo assert that Thomas was \u201csimply copying\u201d Matisse would be to deny the rich and varied underpinnings of her work. Thomas was deeply impressed by the colors and patterns of the natural world around her.\n\n**Credit to Venetian Red Contributors Christine Cariati and Liz Hager for excellent arguments and research\n\nFriday, November 6, 2009\n\nNo Jobs and Everything Costs More - 2005 to 2009 costs of Eggs, Bread, Milk and Gas\n\nI found it positively disgusting that i couldn't find these numbers quickly, easily, or in layman terms after spending over half an hour searching the web and online news.

        "text":"Experimenting with the Square Format: Using the Spartus Full-Vue With Tungsten Film\n\nmasked spartus\n\n\u00a0The Spartus Full-Vue Twin Lens Camera, 1948-1960.\n\nThe Twin Lens Reflex Camera:\n\nMany notable photographers used twin lens cameras: Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, Lisette Model, and Diane Arbus.\u00a0The first twin lens reflex camera appeared in 1880 as a specially built camera for the Kew Observatory in England. The first production twin lens camera appeared in the 1882, introduced as the Academy\u00a0by the British firm, Marion and Company.\u00a0 The camera, a non-reflex design featured an upper viewing lens held at eye level, and produced the distinctive square image that would come to be associated with twin lens cameras. \u00a0Over the next two decades, nearly every major camera manufacturer offered twin lens reflex cameras standardized on the square format.\u00a0[1]\n\n\nTwin lens reflex cameras feature a mirror mounted behind the viewing lens at a 45-degree angle, reflecting light onto the viewing screen. The upper lens is dedicated to viewing and is mechanically synchronized for focus with the lower lens, which is devoted to film exposure. Usually held at waist level to compose and focus, the twin lens reflex camera offers the advantage of a viewing area identical to the exposure area. Twin lens cameras also offer the advantages of being able to view the exposure as it is being made. In addition, the mirror does not have to move to made the exposure. Traditionally the square format negative was cropped to 8\u00d710 inches, the standard paper size. The large negative of the typical twin lens camera, over 4 times the size of the 35mm camera format, presents advantages for enlargement of selected portions of the image without significant loss of detail. The disadvantages of the twin lens design are the slight disparity between the coverage area of the upper and lower lens, referred as parallax error, and a right to left reversal produced by the mirrored image.\n\n\nThe Square Format:\n\nIn painting and photography, the shape of the picture refers to picture\u2019s format.\u00a0 Because rectangles are so prevalent in our daily lives, we seldom notice the shape of the window, table or the pages of a book. Most paintings and photographs are rectangles. The horizontal or vertical format of the rectangle may evoke the breadth of a landscape or the heights of towering mountains. The compositional flexibility of the rectangle helps to make the format ubiquitous. Invisible to the shape of picture, we notice content of the picture rather and shape of the picture.[2]\n\n\nSince very few subjects are naturally square, photographers using the square format cameras often crop their images into rectangles. However, photographers who make the syntactical decision to use \u00a0the square format do so in support of subject and content decisions, and alerts us that each photograph is a means of representing the world. \u00a0Using a square format camera without cropping the image can enliven subject matter by making the photographer and viewer conscious of the shape of the picture and act of taking a photograph. The square format counters the invisibility of the rectangle, and demands that we consider the shape of the picture as well as what is depicted within the shape. The square format presents a fresh challenge to the traditional golden rectangle variants found in most camera viewfinders.\n\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe Spartus Full-Vue Twin Lens Reflex- the Spartus Camera Corporation in Chicago, Illinois, produced the Full-Vue Reflex from 1948-1960. The camera is a simple to use twin-lens reflex box camera featuring an image in the ground glass viewfinder equal to the negative size. With a large viewing lens the Full-Vue boasts an especially bright viewfinder image.In 1949, the Full-Vue \u00a0also featured a synchronized flash attachment.\u00a0The Spartus Full-Vue\u2019s bakelite body [3]\u00a0is fitted with a fixed focus 92mm Scienar plastic lens and takes twelve 6-centimeter exposures on 120mm film. The Spartus Full-Vue employs a rotary shutter\u00a0and as the Full-Vue manual instructs \u201cthe exposure is then made by gently pressing the exposure lever down as far as it will go.\u201d[4]\u00a0The shutter has only two settings: \u201cinst.\u201d (about 1\/60th of a second) and \u201ctime\u201d (a bulb setting for long exposures).\u00a0\n\n\nUsing the Spartus Full-Vue With Tungsten Film in Daylight:\n\nI loaded Fujichrome T64 Professional 120mm Tungsten film into the Spartus Full View, and used the camera to photograph fall color at three California locations in late October, 2013: in the Alder Grove at Yosemite National Park, along the Tenaya Canyon Creek just outside of Lee Vinning on in the Eastern Sierra and at North Bloomfield in the Nevada County. Tungsten films are calibrated for exposure under indoor studio lighting conditions with a Kevin temperature of 3200k producing a much lower color temperature than daylight, which has a Kelvin temperate of 5500k. When shooting tungsten film in daylight conditions, a 85 filter\u00a0compensates for color temperature disparity and when shooting daylight films in tungsten light conditions, an 80a filter is recommend.[5] Using tungsten film in daylight conditions without color correction filters yields unpredictable results and even with identical exposures on the same roll of film.\n\n\nAt each location, I photographed in basic daylight conditions, and exposed the Fujichrome T64 Tungsten film without color correction and without any using a color correction filter. The Full-Vue\u2019s plastic lens produced spectacularly unpredictable results. The appearance of the monochrome reds was surprising, and the deep blues and magentas produced startling mixes of color. The square format of the Spartus Full-Vue supports the muting of image details in the abstraction of unexpected color.\n\n\u00a9David Arnold, 2014.\n\n\n\n[1] S. F.

When looking for the right materials to use \u2013 Minosa\u2122 used Corian\u00ae throughout the kitchen, bathrooms, outdoor area and home theatre.\n\nMinosa\u2122 created three dream bathroom spaces, adopting a feeling of endless luxury and warmth. Using products from the Minosa\u2122 Bathroom Collection allowed them to create an environment that is aesthetically and functionally pleasing. A Double Scoop\u00ae, Scoop\u00ae and The Puddle\u00ae washbasins are all a part of these grand designs all made entirely with Corian\u00ae Solid Surfaces. An art-like unique mosaic feature wall also complements and highlights the Scoop washbasin.\u201cThe Puddle\u00ae, Scoop\u00ae & Double Scoop\u00ae washbasins where chosen to support the very linear & cantilevering nature of the home\u201d, says Simona.The Status bath is also a highlight feature in one of the bathrooms with it\u2019s Corian\u00ae bath surround. It was chosen to complement the Double Scoop\u00ae washbasin, and the style box like nature of the architecture. A minimalist and grand kitchen space was created and Corian\u00ae in Glacier White colour was used on the kitchen benchtops. A custom made dining table was also created with Corian\u00ae that extends to seat another four people.\u201cCorian\u00ae was chosen in the kitchen for its amazing integrity and so we could create work surfaces that are completely seamless and easy to use & care for\u201d, says Darren.The use of Corian\u00ae also extends to the home\u2019s outdoor area. The Utzon BBQ by Electrolux was made in Glacier White colour to match the kitchen, creating a truly integrated feel from the kitchen to the outdoors.\n\n\u201cCorian\u00ae gives us incredible flexibility when creating products and interiors; our bathroom collection is a testament to this. Corian\u00ae allows us to design bold & beautiful washbasins through to stylish organic forms\u201d, says Darren.\n\n\u201cWith Corian\u00ae we are confident our products are durable, practical and completely renewable\u201d, adds Simona.Congratulations to Minosa\u2122 for this outstanding Corian\u00ae Design Award win, and for\u00a0the creation of\u00a0this majestic interior.\n\n\nSearch Minosa\n\nBlog Archive",

        "text":"YAHOO FINANCE John L. Rapisardi scaled\n\n\u2018Learning Never Ends in Photography,\u2019 says Street Photographer John Lawrence Rapisardi\n\nNew York based photographer John Lawrence Rapisardi is an American born on 19th January,1993 who believes that photography is a field where learning never ends. He justifies it with his own experience in the pursuit. John comes from a family of writers, poets, and intellectuals from Sicily, Italy.\n\n\u201cI discovered my interest in design and photography at a very young age. Since then I have swayed creatively been different hobbies but in more recent years I landed with photography and have stuck with it,\u201d says a passionate Rapisardi.\u00a0\n\nJohn Rapisardi\u2019s love for photography takes him places as he spends a lot of his time traveling the world to develop his photography skills. In the past five years or so, he has explored the Middle East, the Caribbean, South America and Europe and has put together a well-received body of work.\n\nThere is no set curriculum when it comes to photography. It is a complicated field where experience is the only real teacher. Rapisardi understands this well and always considers himself a student who is continually evolving. This attitude allows him to learn from everything.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI usually focus on my portrait and fashion photography because I find it to be a little more interesting. I like when I am able to engage with a subject and collaborate. Travel photography is a little more static to me. I don\u2019t really travel places just to take photos, I just always have my camera with me.\u201d\n\nRapisardi has a few portrait and fashion collaborations planned which will be released after New York Fashion Week. He is a notable budding creative in the city and someone to watch for in 2020 in the field.\n\nHarish Pednekar\n\nHarish has helped many startups in building their brand identity and advancing their business through his pro internet marketing strategies.
