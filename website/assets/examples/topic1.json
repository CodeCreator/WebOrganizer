        "text":"Are You Designing for Goosebumps?\n\nTwo design-thinking experts talk about an evolving model for high-impact events.\n\nAllie Mahler and Scott Weiss, partners at consulting firm Community by Design, spend a lot of time thinking about the marriage of design thinking with community design, designing for movements, and experience design, Weiss said.\n\n\u201cWhile design thinking is a powerful process tool, we feel strongly that there needs to be certain behavioral and emotional conditions set in order to catalyze action beyond the conference and experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not inspiring communities on an emotional level, it\u2019s impossible to achieve the outcome you want. How are you designing for goose bumps?\u201d\n\nThey shared some of their best practices for each:\n\nThink about the conference before the conference. We believe that the conference actually begins long before the attendees arrive. Innovation and creative behaviors are seeded through pre-conference questions, conversations, and inspiration. An active community dialogue should be primed and facilitated in advance.\n\nDefine realistic (and aspirational) success metrics. In order to inspire continued engagement, it\u2019s important to set up an action plan with tangible goals and milestones. We like to design accountability activities where participants physically pledge their contribution to the community beyond the event (e.g., having participants write their commitments on a Jenga block in a collective structure).\n\nTell stories of success and failure, often. Good storytelling can create a ripple effect throughout a community or organization. It\u2019s important to establish a fluid cycle of knowledge sharing, feedback capture, and experimentation in order to push initiatives forward and enact change.\n\nInclusivity and diversity \u2014 No matter how powerful the tools or experience, if it\u2019s being administered to a homogenous collection of attendees, it\u2019s likely to have an echo-chamber effect. It\u2019s vital to ensure that there is a diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and expertise in the room.\n\nThoughtful conversations \u2014 Language and dialogue are the building blocks of innovation and implementable design. We feel strongly in the power of artful facilitation across teams in order accomplish a few things: steering insights into opportunities, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued, and strategically pushing towards a successful output within clearly defined time constraints.\n\nConsider the environment.\nIt\u2019s important to stimulate both the intellect and the emotions of the convening participants. The content of the conference is directly influenced by the environment that it\u2019s being shared in. The more thoughtful the design of the space, the more emotionally resonant and elevated the experience. If every touch point of the attendee experience is thoughtfully considered, the results are typically more powerful and rich.\n\nDoes it feel safe? In order to drive toward a shared goal, the conversations that take place throughout the conference need to feel free from judgment and respectful. The more intimate the setting, the more comfortable participants will feel. We\u2019ve often housed teams in individual \u201cliving room\u201d pods across a cavernous conference room space to create more intimacy within groups.\n\nCreative confidence is key. The design-thinking process is only successful if there are creatively confident voices driving it. Therefore, the early stage of any engaging conference should inspire participants to unlock their creativity. There are multiple activities and icebreakers that spark new ways of thinking and behaving \u2014 both as a designer and a radically collaborative teammate.\n\nRead our cover story, \u201cDesign Thinking: An Event Strategists\u2019 Toolkit.\u201d\n\nBarbara Palmer\n\nBarbara Palmer is senior editor and director of digital content.",

        "text":"Marie created a recognizable logo that was an instant hit and a boost to catwalk fundraising. She expanded on her initial creation and produced a series of print and electronic pieces that focused attention on our goal and produced dramatic results. We exceeded our million dollar goal on time thanks in large part to the positive image that Marie built for us.\n\nPat McGinnis\nCity Manager, Grand Haven\n\nI have had the opportunity to work with Marie Kar over the last few years. As a graphic designer and business woman, she has been wonderful. Her ability to understand my needs and put them in action has been outstanding. I have a product call \u201cBenson\u2019s Bottom Paint\u201d which we have been trying to market since 1988. It has gone up and done in sales due to a number of reasons. Since I started working with Marie, to come up with a new look and consistent message to try and market my product, she has used her resources to bring in other people who have worked as a team to help me achieve my goals. My new label design for the product is fresh and eye catching. My sales, even though they are small have been increasing. Marie has been a true professional to work with on this project. I\u2019ve appreciated Marie\u2019s fresh ideas with the design on the \u201cBenson\u2019s Bottom Paint\u201d paint can project. Truly unique.\n\nRandy Dahlquist R.Ph.\nBenson\u2019s Bottom Paint, Inc.\n\nMarie (Redframe Creative) is the epitome of a user friendly and professional company. Marie answers emails and phone calls almost before the request is made. Marie works to the satisfaction of the client. She isn\u2019t happy unless the client is happy. Prices are reasonable and the product is usually beyond expectations. If you contract with Marie you will not be disappointed. She is friendly, competent, thorough, timely, and puts the client first. I would not hesitate to give her the highest praise and to recommend her to anyone seeking the highest quality.\n\nRichard L. Baldwin\nButtonwood Press\n\nWhen we decided to build a new building we started thinking about branding and re-imaging the company. One of the first things we knew we needed was a logo so\nWe turned to Redframe Creative. Marie made it easy by asking the right questions about our vision and she came back with our vision as well as concepts that were variations of it. She made it fast and affordable. Thanks Redframe!\n\nJames J. Willison Sr.\nTri City Auto Repair\n\nMarie is a rare and oh-so-talented blend of advanced technological and graphics skill, creative artistry, and \u201cold school\u201d values, commitment and self discipline. I will never use another graphics design professional for my books besides her, and trust her implicitly. She sets the bar high for her work and follows through with amazing reliability.\n\nGarrett L. Turke, Ph.D.\n\nI am very happy with the work Marie has done for my business. She is very easy to communicate with and is very talented at her work! I would highly recommend Red Frame Creative!\n\nCarrie Anne Engels\nWhat a Gem Jewelry\n\nWorking with Marie and Redframe Creative was lots of fun\u2014pure pleasure; in fact, in some ways I hate to see it end. I think that\u2019s because the process was a true collaboration, which is what made this experience so enjoyable. Marie provided a creative design framework that allowed each of us to bring our own sensibilities to the project. The finished product reflects that synergy\u2014not only of the four of us, but of the four thought leaders and the eight practitioners. You can sense everyone\u2019s part in the booklets!\n\nDaryl Fischer\n\nWe so appreciated your ability to grasp the meaning behind the content and really bring it to life through the combination of design, our images, and stock photos. This was particularly impressive since you were hitting it \u201ccold.\u201d In addition, we very much appreciated your responsiveness to multiple reviewers and comments, your own lively intelligence brought to review of the two booklets and your focus on getting it right! It was a pleasure to work with you.\n\nRandy Roberts and Rachel Tooker,\nCrocker Art Museum, Sacramento, CA",

I\u2019m having\n2-3 exhibitions in the year time. I\u2019m photographing\npeople for 18 years now. All that you can name a portrait.\n\nTwo years ago Mikolaj Grynberg started working on his project Many Women.\nIt started with a series of pictures of various women form the artist\u2019s closest\ntitled Many Women-Warsaw. The photos were exhibited at a train\nstation in Rio de Janeiro.\nNext to them the artist set up an ad hoc photo\natelier, to which he would invite\nfemale passers-by. They thus became\nsubjects for the next photo-series.\nThe brasilian even was a happening,\nthe spectators were random passers-by,\njournalists and invited guests.\nThe Central De Brasil show lead to creating another exhibit,\n\nMany Women \u2013 Rio\n, very different form the Polish sequence as it was\na photo-record\nof random and unique encounters. Mikolaj Grynberg decided to continue and expand his project. In urban\nspaces all around the world the artist repeats the scenario form\nRio de Janeiro: he shows the exhibit Many Women \u2013 Warsaw and\nat the same time invites random local women to be photographed\non the spot. Within last four months Grynberg has finished a few\nnext, very successful parts of this project in Kiev \/Ukraine\/,\nMexico City \/Mexico\/ and Lima \/Peru\/.\nMany Women is a testimony of emotions that occur during a unique\n20 minute encounter between the artist and each of the photographed\nwomen. Time from being noticed in the crowd to exposing the last of\n12 film frames. Teasing curiosity, fascination, shyness, joy, pride,\nmelancholy, even anger and desire captured in a black and white\nframe. Universal emotions, where geographical and political borders\nvanish. The photos are made in b&w and are the lith prints.\n\ninvited by Joanna Kinowska\nup to you: we're looking for a strong support to realize this\nproject in Sweden. Any ideas? The media patron of the project\nis \"Wysokie obcasy\" magazine and the main support is from\nthe Promotional Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Poland.\n\ngruppo F inbox: Walter, Shanghai, China\n\nClose but far away\n\nthe loud silence\n\nIf you take a car.\nDrive for ten hours to the north from Stockholm.\nThen take on your cross country skies.\nAnd ski for about one hour, mostly up hill.\nThen cross some creeks,\npass some scooter trails,\nsome sleeping bears.\n\nIf you do that.\nAnd you are still alive.\nYou might end up in this place.\n\nHere where the silence is more present than anywhere else.\nLoud even.\n\nHere it is just traces of civilisation\nIt is almost like one of those diseases,\none of those where the body is repelling a part of the body.\n\nThis is the repelled part.\nA lost limb.\n\nThe place where our civilisation said:\n\u2013Hey, no one could possibly want to live there anyway\u2026\nWe outsource it to somewhere closer.\nAnd call it Skansen or whatever.\nThen we have it within reach.\nSafe and packaged.\n\nBut just like the sandwiches wrapped in plastic.\nIt doesn\u2019t taste quite as good.\nNot quite the same.\n\nSo every year\nI come here, by car and skies.\nVisiting the repelled part.\n\nAnd I listen to the loud silence.\n\nPhotos and thoughts: christofer grandin\n\n[Soldiers] A Pro Ad",
