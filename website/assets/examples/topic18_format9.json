        "text":"\n\nMass realization of the portents of the End Times in the last 30 years confirms that the life span of this world is 7000 years.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In 8 hadiths narrated by our Prophet (saas) and told by Imam Suyuti who is one of the greatest hadith imams it is notified that the life span of the world is 7000 years and 5600 years of this have passed until the time of our Prophet (saas).\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0When we extract 5600 from 7000, 1400 years is left.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In another hadith, our Prophet (saas) told that \u201cthe life span of this ummah will not quite pass 1500 years.\u201d\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Since we are in the year of Hijri 1430 now and calculate that we are in the Hijri 14th century till the year of Hijri 1500, then it is a certain fact that Hazrat Mahdi (as) has to come within this century.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Because there is no other century left for Hazrat Mahdi (as) to come.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The realization of almost all the portents of the End Times narrated by our Prophet (saas) in the hadiths one after the other since the beginning of the Hijri 1400, clearly shows that we are in the End Times and Hazrat Mahdi (as) will come within this century.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Further the fact that all of the portents have been realized in the last 30 years confirms the hadiths that the life span of the world is 7000 years, 5600 years of this have passed till the time of our Prophet (saas) and the life span of this ummah will not quite pass 1500 years.\n\n\nThe portents realized one after the other in the last 30 years starting from the beginning of Hijri 1400 are as follows:\n\n1.\u00a0 Stopping the waters of Euphrates in 1975.

In the hadith, it is reported that it would be very bright and Lulin is 6 times brighter than the other stars.\n\n9. A sign from the Sun emerges. (In 1996, giant explosions took place in the Sun.

        "text":"5 Christmas Games for Your Ministry\n\n\nCheck out these 5 Christmas Games for your ministry so kids can have a blast celebrating Jesus\u2019 birth.\n\nWhere is the love for Christmas games? Looking around, I\u2019m finding Christmas musicals and carols, Christmas-themed snacks, and Christmas crafts. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love all of that. But I think it\u2019s time we talk about some festive Christmas games to play with your kids. I found some great games for kids of all ages that not only are a ton of fun, but also come with debriefing questions to help kids pick up on the message behind the activity. Here are five Christmas games for kids of all ages in your ministry.\n\n\n1. Christmas Bingo- For your younger kids who aren\u2019t ready to read yet, try out this fun Christmas version of bingo. Instead of letters and numbers, kids get a card of Christmas-related pictures like an angel, Mary, and a star. Kids use Christmas candies to mark off the images that you describe. Your children will have a blast playing Christmas bingo.\n\n2. Treasure Seekers- A game for your 6- to 9-year-old kids, Treasure Seekers gets kids thinking about why Jesus came to earth. Blindfolded kids will rely on their teammates, who aren\u2019t allowed to speak, to find candy canes hidden in the room. Afterwards, kids make the connection that just as the teammates helped guide the blindfolded kids, Jesus helps guide us to God.\n\n3. Snowball Wreath Toss- With all the distractions around us, it can be hard to focus on what really matters this season. The Snowball Wreath Toss is a fun game for 6- to 9-year-olds that will help them prepare their hearts for Christmas. Kids toss \u201csnowballs\u201d that look a lot like ping pong balls into a \u201cwreath\u201d that just happens to look like a swimming pool noodle. After the challenging game, kids learn that it can also be challenging to focus our hearts for Christmas. That\u2019s when they learn about giving, thanking, and celebrating Jesus.\n\n4. Christmas Gift Wrap Race- Want your kids to understand it\u2019s better to give than receive? Help your older kids understand the giving spirit of Christmas with this Gift Wrap Race game. Kids are given everything they need to wrap a present for the world\u2026the only thing is, they have to come up with the gift. Will they choose peace? An end to hunger? It\u2019s up to them!\n\n5. Bethlehem or Bust- This silly, fun icebreaker game is perfect for older kids around 10 to 12 years old. Teams will run a relay race while reenacting the first Christmas using cleaning supplies. For example, kids will grab a mop and say \u201cNobroom at the inn!\u201d Not only is it a great way to do a quick review of the first Christmas, kids will be laughing the entire time. The game works even better if you can get the adults to join in as well.\n\n\nWhat games do you and your kids play at Christmastime? Do you have any special Christmas traditions that make the season special? Share your thoughts with us in our comment section below!\n\nRelated Post\n\n\nAbout Author\n\nDavid Jennings\n\nDavid has served kids around the world for the majority of his life. From Texas to Romania, he has followed where God has led him. Most recently, he served for six years as a children's director in the great state of Alabama before moving to Colorado to work for Group as an associate editor.\n\n\n  1. Children's Ministry Magazine\n\n    At our \"Happy Birthday, Jesus\" Christmas parties, a favorite game for the kids in my children's ministry is \"Pin the Tail on the Donkey.\" I relate the game to the donkey that Mary rode on.\n\n  2. Children's Ministry Magazine\n    Helmut Egesa Wagabi on\n\n    Children are usually divided into two groups, one representing Mary the mother of Jesus and the other representing the wise men. Mary's team sit in one place holding dolls that symbolize the baby Jesus, and the wise men come in with sweets, biscuits and juices to give to Mary's team. Afterwards, both groups get together and eat the stuff presented.\n\nLeave A Reply",

        "text":"Catalyst October Issue 2010\n\nSince Pope Benedict XVI announced that he would visit the United Kingdom in September, his critics have gone ballistic. The following is a sample of some of the commentary leading up to his visit. All comments appear in their original form:\n\nThe Independent, 4\/2\/2010:\u00a0\u201cThe Pope, to put it baldly, is now too embattled and too damaged by the worldwide revelations of abuse and cover-up to be able to come to this country without controversy, protests and distaste.\u201d\n\nThe Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland,\u00a0New Scotsman, 6\/10\/2010:\u00a0\u201cA statement said they find it \u2018offensive that this visit results from an invitation to the Pope as Head of State, giving him that recognition and pretended legitimacy which he claims in opposition to the principles of the Reformation.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDescribing the Papacy as \u2018deceitful and unrighteous,\u2019 the Free Presbyterians highlighted recent global exposure of child abuse by Roman Catholic clergy, and suggest the Pope has connived in a cover-up.\u201d\n\nCristina Odone,\u00a0Sunday Telegraph, 9\/5\/2010:\u00a0\u201cThese are different times. Catholics have watched in horror as, almost daily and almost in every country, broken men and women have come forth to tell of their ordeal at the hands of abusive priests.\u201d (Our italic.)\n\nSinead O\u2019Connor,\u00a0The Guardian, 9\/5\/2010:\u00a0\u201c\u2018Catholic\u2019 has become a word associated with negativity, with abuse, with violence, but the essence of Catholicism is beautiful. The fact is, tragically, it\u2019s been brought into disrepute by the people running it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBenedict is in no position to call himself Christ\u2019s representative. The pope should stand down, the Vatican should stand down, not only because of the cover-up, they\u2019re incredibly arrogant, they\u2019re anti-Christian. They don\u2019t have the remotest relationship with God.\u201d\n\nPeter Tatchell,\u00a0Telegraph, 9\/8\/2010:\u00a0\u201cBenedict XVI put the interests and image of the church before the welfare of children and young people. He is unfit to remain as Pope. He should resign.\u201d\n\nKeith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society,\u00a0The Irish Post, 9\/8\/2010:\u00a0\u201cThis anti-Catholicism of which Adamus complains is shared by most British Catholics, sickened by their church hierarchy\u2019s dogma driven policies on contraception, homosexuality and even abortion. That is why Mass attendance here has halved in just 20 years and why only a quarter of Catholics agree with the official line on abortion\u2014and fewer still on homosexuality and contraception.\u201d\n\nBernard Wynne, a spokesman for Catholic Voices for Reform,Telegraph, 9\/8\/2010:\u00a0\u201cThe church, I think, is deeply misogynist and we have to change that.\u201d\n\nJulie Burchill,\u00a0Independent, 9\/8\/2010:\u00a0\u201cHow broad-minded this country is, when we consider that the British taxpayer will shortly be shelling out millions of pounds to protect a former member of the Hilter Youth who believes Anglicans will burn in Hell when the Pope visits this country next week\u2014Just after we commemorate the beginning of the Nazi Blitz on this country! Tolerant or WHAT!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe behaviour of the Church during the Second World War, and to the Jews generally, was vile\u2014and REALLY makes me wonder if it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to pick a Pope who HADN\u2019T been in the Hitler Youth? Closer to home, let alone legions of child-raping holy men, only last week a leading light in the Catholic Church defended its role in moving a priest believed to be involved in three bombings which killed nine people, including Catholics, in the village of Claudy, Co Londonderry, in 1972. The youngest was an eight-year-old girl: \u2018suffer little children,\u2019 indeed.\u201d\n\nPeter Tatchell, CNN.com, 9\/16\/2010:\u00a0\u201cWe do not believe that the pope should be honored with a state visit, given his role in the cover up of child sex abuse by Catholic clergy. Even today, he is refusing to hand the Vatican\u2019s secret sex abuse files to the police in countries worldwide. He is protecting the abusers. This makes him complicit with sex crimes against children. Such a person does not deserve the honor of a state visit.\u201d\n\n\u201cPius XII was no saint. The fact that Pope Benedict wants to makes him a saint shows how far he has strayed from the moral and ethical values of most Catholics and most of humanity.\u201d\n\nReverend Ian Paisley, 9\/16\/2010:\u00a0\u201cWe are here for a very solemn and serious reason today, the whole day is nonsense\u2026. I have just seen the statement made today which says that if you pay \u00a325 to be at the Mass in Scotland your sins will be forgiven. No man can forgive sins but Christ himself, it is misleading nonsense.\u201d\n\nAndrew Copson, British Humanist Association Chief Executive website:\u00a0\u201cThe Protest the Pope campaign is calling on the British government to disassociate itself from the Pope\u2019s intolerant teachings on issues such as women\u2019s rights, gay equality and the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV. On these and many other issues, Benedict is out of step with the majority of British people, including most Catholics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Pope\u2019s attitude to lesbian and gay people is just one of the many stances that the Vatican State holds which are damaging to human dignity and human rights.\u201d\n\nPepper Harow, Protest the Pope:\u00a0\u201cWe really think that we got the message across that the Pope is not welcome on a State visit. His outspoken state policies on homosexuality, condoms, education and abortion, as well as the child abuse scandal, continue to affect the rights of millions of individuals across the world and mean that he should not be given the honour of a State visit.\u201d\n\nAtheism UK website:\u00a0\u201cThis is yet another example of hypocrisy of the church. What we have here is an institution that claims moral superiority and preaches respect for life. That it is able to abandon its own teachings when it suits them is deplorable and dishonest. It seems the church does not care what crimes it commits, just so long as they do not get caught. It\u2019s clear that the Catholic Church places the survival of the Institution above the welfare of ordinary men, women and children.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not wish to see a man who calls himself \u2018God\u2019s Vicar on Earth\u2019 and is thereby purely deluded, coming to this country and spreading his poisonous and demonstrable false doctrine to the people of this country, not to mention that he is implicated in the cover up of child rape and that he is making British taxpayers pay for the privilege in these financially troubled times.\u201d\n\nRichard Dawkins,\u00a0New Humanist Magazine:\u00a0\u201cGo home to your tinpot Mussolini-concocted principality, and don\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\nHumanist Society of Scotland:\u00a0\u201cThere are particular grounds in Northern Ireland for opposition to the visit. First of all, there is strong evidence that Pope Benedict was complicit in the cover-up of the abuse of children throughout the island by continuing to insist that accusations of paedophilia within the priesthood should be treated by the Church\u2019s own exclusive jurisdiction. Secondly, the Pope\u2019s insistence that the Catholic Church maintains its own schools is prolonging segregated education, which is detrimental to the future of peace.\u201d\n\nGeoffrey Robertson, Human Rights Lawyer:\u00a0\u201cFor 30 years, as Cardinal Ratzinger, from 1981 on, he was in charge of what to do about paedophile priests and he declined on the whole to even defrock them. It\u2019s been many centuries since a Pope has resigned but it would be a very dignified and honourable action\u2026.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to see that tens of thousands of children who have been raped by priests\u2026as a human rights atrocity. It\u2019s gone on throughout the world. Wherever the church is, there have been abusers.\u201d\n\nNational Secular Society Website:\u00a0\u201cYou can show your disapproval of Ratzinger by protesting against the legal bans that the Vatican has fought for on abortion and stem cell research. And also for his obdurate, and breathtakingly irresponsible, opposition to contraception. It fuels a population growth that is unsustainable. Women in poverty-stricken circumstances in countries with dwindling resources are doomed to have large families that they cannot support and who frequently starve. And his using all means, even dishonest ones, to prevent condom use causing untold numbers to die unnecessarily of AIDS because the only known barrier against the disease, condoms, is denied to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cGay people from around the country will also be coming to put two fingers up to Benedict\u2019s constant defamation and insults. He calls gay relationships\u2014however loving and committed they may be\u2014\u2018intrinsically disordered\u2019 and \u2018morally evil\u2019. He even says that sympathising with gay people who are being persecuted is a sin. Make no mistake, the Vatican has declared war on gay people and this is the time to start the fightback.\u201d\n\n\u201cRatzinger is, without doubt, guilty of enabling this culture of secrecy and betrayal to continue throughout the thirty years he has been at the top of the Vatican hierarchy both as a Cardinal and as Pope. He has done little to correct it because he still considers that the reputation of the church is more important than the future lives of children who are mercilessly abused, indeed raped, by his priests.\u201d\n\nTerry Sanderson, president of the National Secular Society:\u00a0\u201cI cannot believe that we are lauding the head of an organisation that not only insults and denigrates homosexuals, tries to restrict the rights of women by banning contraception and abortion, but deliberately lies about the effectiveness of condoms in the fight against AIDS. This invitation is a rebuke to all those Britons who are incensed by the horrific revelations that are emerging daily about the Vatican\u2019s activities. The Government should be sharply criticising rather than welcoming this man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not going to try to arrest the pope, but we do want him to know that his teachings are profoundly inhumane and damaging to so many people.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtest the Pope started as a protest about the cost of this visit, but others have joined that have different issues with Ratzinger \u2013 women who want to take their rightful place in the church...

        "text":"10 Reasons Why You Can\u2019t Take Jesus Literally If You Don\u2019t Take The Bible Literally\n\n10 Reasons\n\nThere seems to be a lot of people questioning the validity of Scripture lately and lots of talk about whether or not we can even take the Bible literally. Most recently, Dove-award winning and Grammy-award nominated Michael Gungor shocked the Christian world\u00a0by sharing similar out-of-the-box theological views, including casting doubt over the Biblical accounts of Adam & Eve, and The Flood. The bandwagon-belief of late is to accept the life of Christ without necessarily believing all of the Bible. This is dangerous ground to tread upon because it can lead to the slippery slope of seizing a \u201cdifferent gospel\u201d (Galatians 1:6-10). This is \u201cCafeteria Christianity\u201d where we pick and choose what we want to believe (from Scripture) and discard what we don\u2019t want. To be a Christian is to follow Christ and embrace what He taught.\n\n10 Reasons Why You Can\u2019t Take Jesus Literally If You Don\u2019t Take The Bible Literally\n\n1. Jesus is the Living Word. John 1:1 says, \u201cIn the beginning was the Word. The Word was with God and the Word was God. Verse 14 says, \u201cAnd the Word became flesh (Jesus) and dwelt among us.\u201d The Bible is a person. That person is Jesus.\n\n2. All Scripture is inspired by God.\u00a0(2 Timothy 3:16)\n\n3. To question the account of Noah is to question Christ.\u00a0Jesus said, \u201cJust as it was in the\u00a0days of Noah\u00a0so will it be when the Son of Man (Jesus) returns.\u201d (Matthew 24:37, Luke 17:26)\n\n4. The Law matters. Jesus said He came to fulfill the Law of Moses, not do away with it. (Matthew 5:17)\n\n5. Jesus is compared to the first man, Adam, and Scripture even\u00a0confirms that Christ is the last-Adam. (1 Corinthians 15:45)\n\n6. Jesus quotes and refers to the Old Testament several times, including God\u2019s purpose for marriage. (Mark 10:6-9)\n\n7. The Old Testament points to Jesus, period.\n\n8. Numerous prophecies (going as far back as Genesis) in the Old Testament were fulfilled in the New Testament through the birth, life, and resurrection of Christ.\n\n9. God cannot lie.\u00a0If all of the Bible is not true, then God is a liar, which means Jesus is a liar and cannot be trusted. (Numbers 23:19, Hebrews 6:18)\n\n10. God makes it clear that we cannot add or take away from the Bible. (Revelation 22:18-19)\n\nI\u2019m all for human reasoning and logic, but the reality is the Bible is packed with stories that are not logical. Jesus is Truth and Truth trumps logic. This is where faith comes in. After all, our entire relationship with God is based on faith.\n\nThe Bible is not rocket science, people. It says what it says and means what it says. We either believe it or we don\u2019t. We either believe all of it or none of it.\n\nI take the Bible literally because I believe Jesus.\n\n3 Thoughts\n\n  1. Reblogged this on AntiPerish and commented:\n    It breaks my heart to see people falling away from the Word of God. In his latest blog, my good friend and Pastor, Chuck Tate does a great job explaining why you can\u2019t truly follow Christ while denying the Word that reveals him.\n\n  2. Concerning the law on point 4, I think it\u2019s necessary to point out a distinction. Matthew 5:17 and Ephesians 2:15 seen to contradict, but do not.\n\n    In Matthew 5:17, Yeshua is saying that he did not come to destroy the law. Literally, a disintegration. Similar to rust or decay.\n\n    In Ephesians 2:15, Paul is using a different word that means to make idle, of no use.\n\n    So Yeshua didn\u2019t come to destroy the law, but to render it useless. The law came at man\u2019s request at the foot of Moriah anyway. God wanted to speak to the people, they didn\u2019t want to hear Him out of fear and requested that Moses get instructions from Him.\n\n    Unique perspective concerning the introduction of the law.\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"April 5, 2012\n\nSeven Faces of Intention by Dr. Dyer\n\n\"There is a universal source of energy that is called the \u201cpower of intention.\u201d This source \u2013 whether you call it God, the divine, or something else \u2013 is always available to us and is infinite in its possibilities. - Dr Wayne Dyer\nSeven Faces of Intention: Creativity, Kindness, Love, Beauty, Expansion, Unlimited Abundance, and Receptivity - \u00a0are the keys to unlocking the power of intention in your life.\u00a0\n\n1. Creativity\n\n\u00a0\u2013 Realize that there is creativity within you, and learn to recognize and appreciate your creative impulses. You don\u2019t have to be an artist or a writer \u2013 creativity is just as important to the business person looking for the next big idea.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever felt inspired by a purpose or calling, you know the feeling of Spirit working through you. Inspired is our word for in-spirited.\u201d\nLearn to recognize this state of being in-spirited, and you\u2019ll unlock your inner creativity.\n\n2. Kindness\n\n\u00a0\u2013Whether you call it karma, the law of reciprocity or the power of positive thinking, work from the belief that you\u2019ll be rewarded for good intentions.\nDr. Dyer shares the science behind kindness in The Power of Intention. When you do something kind for someone else, their brain releases serotonin \u2013 and so does yours! Serotonin is a hormone that makes us feel good. So, every act of kindness makes two happier people in the world.\n\u201cIf you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.\u201d\n\n3. Love\n\n\u00a0- Think of this power of intention as the face of kindness exponentiation with the emotion of love.\nLove means a lack of judgment, a lack of anger or resentment. It means recognizing God in others.\n\n4. Beauty\n\n\u00a0\u2013 The face of beauty is the face of intention.\u00a0\nLearn to appreciate the beauty of everything around you.\nThe face of beauty is truth, honesty and a knowing that what \"is\" -- is exactly as it should be. You can use this power by re-framing any negative thoughts you have towards others and replace them with an appreciate (a thankfulness attitude) towards them.\n\n5. Expansion\n\n\u00a0\u2013 Expand your awareness of what is possible.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t set limits on yourself; instead, learn to listen to your intuition.\u00a0\nIf you see the world as a negative and hurtful place, then you\u2019re only ever going to experience it that way. Instead, learn to recognize your true nobility.\n\u201cTrue nobility isn\u2019t about being better than someone else, it\u2019s about being better than you used to be.\u201d\n\n6.Unlimited Abundance\n\n\u00a0\u2013 Realizing your unlimited abundance means facing down your fears and limitations. Dr. Dyer has a simple three-word suggestion for how to put this into action:\u00a0\nAct \u201cas if\u201d. This means acting as if the thing you want has already happened.\nYou were probably taught all of your life about limitations and about what is \"not possible.\" Fortunately, this came from well-meaning people who believed in limitation and not abundance. This law does not require you to be intellectually perfect in order to receive the benefits. Believing in unlimited abundance has no downside, so why not take another look at your business life after you answer this question, \"What if I could have it all?\"\n\n7. Receptivity\u00a0\n\nThis means being open without judgment. Being aware enough and engaged enough to see possibilities where others don\u2019t. And most importantly, it means simply relaxing and letting the Power of Intention do its work.",
