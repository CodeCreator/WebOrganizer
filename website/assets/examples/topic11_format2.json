        "text":"The Eyes of The Lich Queen\n\nSession #2\n\nThrough the Forest\n\nChapter 2\nFrom Dinner Parties to Dragon Funerals\n\nUsually when a death occurs it is the living wearing black\u2026 in this\ncase it was the dead.\n\nBlack dragons and black scaled lizard folk littered the ground at our feet. Remnants of faerie fire and arrows give evidence to an awesome battle. Mounds of precious metals lined the chamber that we, a Human Rogue, a halfling Monk, a dragon born Paladin, and myself find ourselves in.\n\nWe were fortunate to add a new member to our party, a bronze skinned dragon born paladin. I didn\u2019t care to notice which deity to which he prayed. I always preferred the paladins who spoke to gods through battle more so than speech. There is nothing worse than a paladin who believes that everyone needs to hear about their gods. Every god damn week there was some paladin of some god knocking on my door asking if I had found \u201cwhoever they were babbling about\u201d. Then there were those \u201cdo goodie\u201d paladins sitting atop mounts or hanging out in market places providing \u201cprotection\u201d for a fee. Either way, this guy seems ok. Perhaps I should learn his name. Seems like this meat-head may last a while.\n\nI\u2019m not used to these kind of jobs. If I didn\u2019t believe we were somehow referred by that sweet-ass-ed hobgoblin from the basement of the last job we did, I probably wouldn\u2019t have taken this kind of work. I enjoyed researching with the rogue prior to traveling, but I am not comfortable with the lack of information about specific items that we were looking for, and other detailed information about the heist. On the other hand it was nice to stop planning and simply take actions. After-all, some of the situations we will find ourselves in this day, will not provide the time to plan and discuss our options.\n\nLike the ancient dragon skeleton laying in the corner, we took a long rest, bedding ourselves in the coins. Feeling much more empowered to face anything this job may have to offer, we located a secret rotating door that entered into a long hallway.\n\nAt the end of this long hallway, our expert Rogue managed to locate a gearbox that activated a moving wall. Essentially, we had about 30 seconds to live. it was like I had lived this experience in another life at another time, like I remembered the future. Together with the help of my premonition the rogue and I were able to stop the moving wall.\n\nNow we had to deal with the bars. We couldn\u2019t squeeze through them, and the dragon could not break them. He may have rattled his bones to dust before he was every able to break a single bar. After seeing how the bar mechanism was behaving after being stuck by the force of Tyr, we were able to work through how the mechanism worked and got the bars to be begin to lower. However, as the bars were lowering the wall at the back of the room started to move towards us again. I climbed up the front of the dragon man and heaved myself, clumsily, over the top of the bars. I think the tindragon may have touched my butt for a little too long though. It made me feel dirty, but I was relieved to be on the other side of the dragon-garlic mincer.\n\nWe entered into the next room. Every inch of the room seemed to be filled with a moving blades. Like a man inspired by an otherworldly force, the Tindragon heaved his warhammer into the the spinning blades. Locking up the mechanisms for the blades, the entire room began to shake trying to break through the warhammer. The warhammer held fast, for the moment. As we proceeded, two constructs began to dance rhythmically through the room as if they were dodging blades. While the robots were slowly dancing across the room, and the stressed metals cogs and widgets strained, rattled, and threatened to turn the room into a dimension called \u201cthe dimension of a million flying shrapnel pieces\u201d, we stopped to consider our options. We also found that the constructs would also stop to attack an illusion. Frankly, the robots looked less frightening than the quivering spinning blades that were position quite nicely to cleave my head off. We began to launch an assault ranged weapons at the constructs. We managed to make it through the room, and three locked gates, just as the room turned into a room of a trillion metal splinters.\n\nWe entered into the next room. A horrible room of platforms and lava. As we approached the center platform, two creepy metal dogs with grabby tongues appeared on the center platform. Like a fat cat failing to gain momentum while jumping onto a couch, one of the dogs fell to his death trying to reach our platform. The next began chewing on the midsection of the monk. It was impressive. The monk turned pale and dusky and was now shaped like an hour glass. Audibly we knew his insides were rearranged. The paladin took care of the feebled monk.\n\nI had other plans. Feeling 100% ineffective against this metal dog, and frankly not wanting to get licked by it\u2019s gross slimy tongue, I hoped that by removing the khyber\/sybaris crystal from the ceiling, that the seemingly extra-planer beings would disappear. We were not so fortunate. My thoughts were somewhat confirmed or at least supported when I felt something \u201center\u201d the crystal when the beast was destroyed. Not wanting to see those things again, ever, I flicked the stone into the lava. I head screaming and felt and inner relief. No worth of that crystal justified keeping the the stone and thus the possibility of my insides becoming strangled like the monks. Nope. Nope. Nope. I heard the metal-head yelling something, I made it known that I didn\u2019t care.\n\nWe walked into a chamber. In the chamber was a scepter and and amulet of that seemed very much like some loot Sur\u2019kil may be looking for. I attempted to use the arcane to detect magic around us. Suddenly, it felt like the world around me was melting and my corneas were being removed from my eyes with a sun-rod. Momentarily I gave up on the life that i had previously known. My new life belonged to a world of whites and reds, and pain. I had no body, I could not move, I was part of something greater than myself. Everything?\n\nI snapped back to reality\u2026 my reality. A mummy half dragon beast was ensnared in a tangle of hippy paladin might. I uttered some words and faerie fire outline the visage of the beast. We pummeled it dead. It lay dead on the ground dripping acid from its exposed neck. We looted the goods and took images of designs found on the alter. Seemingly, the only way to go was from where we came. We climbed back out the well and contacted Sur\u2019kil.\n\nWith loot in hand we continued to move.\n\n\n\nI'm sorry, but we no longer support this web browser.

        "text":"A Dungeon Deep\n\nA false god?\n\nThe party turned their hoard of goods from Gresh\u2019fax\u2019s lair into a new The Dragonslayer Farm. After hiring the poor folk of Applevale and procuring orphans (don\u2019t ask where) to man their farm, the settled down to plan the next step.\n\nFrom the west a phalanx of armored soldiers approached and declared their quest to destroy the traitorous Oksuno. From Maggie\u2019s pouch the symbol of Almanna burst into flames. In a vicious battle the party destroyed the flame soldiers of Almanna. Ox declared Almanna a false god through a singed and blackened throat.\n\nElmira and Magpie journeyed to Highhurst where they purchased some magical armor each with its own quirks. Later that afternoon they defended the merchant Fazin from some ruffians. The ruffians apparently belong to a gang called the Grave Wights and Fazin suggested that the Trade Consortium would probably pay handsomely to be rid of the menace. The pair next traveled to the Church of Almanna where they learned that the creatures probably tracked them through the symbol Maggie carried. They also learned of a great wizard Fairweather who lives at the top of the mountain Jondeheim. That evening Maggie deposited the token of Almanna back into Almanna\u2019s temple. The next day the party prepared to set out on the journey to Jondeheim uncertain if there were foes at their back, or what they would face once they arrived.\n\nAnd the Frogmen Rejoiced\n\nAfter a vicious battle in the halls of the doomed dwarves the party prevailed over the last of the illithid menace. Gravely wounding or killing their leader they drove them from the caves, but were unable to slay them all. After a bit of searching they found the remainder of the poor folk of Applevale trapped and likely on their way to becoming mindless slaves like the dwarves. Carefully navigating the now much more perilous illusion traps they returned the villagers to their ruined homes. Packing their vast wealth and taking with them the two would be dragon hunters Marcus and Vincent, the adventurers left for greener pastures and larger cities. Leaving the villagers to bury their dead, and the frogmen to proliferate wildly.\n\nThey arrived in Highhurst and immediately sought a wizard to describe the valuables they\u2019d plundered from the dragons horde as well as the den of the illithid. With new-found knowledge they bent their minds to what they would do about the dragon\u2019s curse.\n\nThe Story so Far\n\nCoerced into aiding the troubled town of Applevale the party descended into the deep mines that are the reason for Applevale\u2019s existence to force back the frogman menace. There they were confronted by frogmen on multiple occasions, but drove them back each time. Until they arrived at the frogman city lorded over by Elial, their king. Elial informed the party that he had no quarrel with the humans of the city. But that an order known as the Cult of Gresh\u2019fax had taken it upon themselves to force the frogmen from their normal breeding ground.\n\nLed by the fearless Ox driven on a quest to destroy this Gresh\u2019fax the party moved even further away from the light. After discovering and slaying a good number of Gresh\u2019fax\u2019s powerful alcolytes they discovered the dragon whelp himself cowering over his treasure. They slayed him handily with the help of Ox\u2019s newfound blades and claimed the treasure horde for themselves.\n\nAfter hauling the treasure to the surface (with the help of the frogmen alcolytes newly devoted to The Invaders) the party caroused with the local folk. They were approached by an unusually articulate frogman and returned to the frogman city to check on the rumor the frogman had given them. Finding it false they returned to the surface to find their horde had been taken by the illithid group that shared the cavern. They made their way down to the illithid caverns and through cunning ruses and with Ox\u2019s powerful ability to cut through illusions have killed many of the illithid kind.\n\n\nI'm sorry, but we no longer support this web browser.

        "text":"Schemes of the Lich King\n\nEpisode 15: The Secrets of the Ice Harp\nThe castle reveals new horrors but also new allies.\n\nNot long after facing the horrific demonic entity in the caverns near the castle spas, the adventurers decided to double back to the spa and rest there for a few hours, regaining their strength. Whatever foul creatures seemed to inhabit the castle, seemed to keep away from the spas and bath area.\n\nWhile taking one of the watches for the night, Glaedwin Longclef and Saerid Turquoise began hearing some unusual noises on the other side of the door and noticed a strange, paranormal mist that began to permeate from underneath the frame. Waking the others, they asked their resident wizard, Dracovel Kilvesh what he could determine and all he was able to provide was that it was supernatural.\n\nOpening the door, Glaedwin was confronted by the spirit of Nonnette, his deceased fiance. Looking pale and ghostly, as well as more haunting than his past visions of her had been, she was clearly trying to speak but it was if she was prevented by some force. When she finally used the energy to break whatever enchantment had been holding her back, she began to provide the group with extremely distressing news. She explained that the Lich King had uncovered the secrets of something called the Soul Forge and was using it to siphon off spirits and souls, destined to the afterlife, and using them to power some horrible plan. Whereas he still needed certain parts to fully power this evil artifact, the horrors he would be able to unleash if he were to make it operational would be unimaginable. Sadly, she admitted that she, herself, was in danger of being brought into his dominion. Shortly after revealing this, she was pulled back into whatever realm she was in.\n\nPacking up and continuing the quest, the adventurers pushed forward, trying to address the situation at hand. Glaedwin, however, did his best to send along a note, using the Prince\u2019s Pouch to the Prince of Shadows, informing him of the Lich King\u2019s plans.\n\nFinding a former schoolroom and library, the characters were attacked by a small demon as well as a gang of vile Tooth Fairies. Whereas the demon was not overly powerful, his Tooth Fairy followers did enough damage by attacking teeth and fingers with rusty and grotesque pliers. Dispatching them, the adventurers moved on until they came to a chamber being guarded by powerful undead, seemingly guarding a statue. Upon ridding themselves of the zombies, the statue was revealed as a statue of Flyght, a dragon. The inscription on the small statue read that Flyght was a \u2018smiter of evil.\u2019 This was, at least, some good news in that most everything they had come across was tragic as of late. If only this Flyght were somewhere nearby . . .\n\nPressing on, more rooms underneath the castle were explored but little was discovered until they came to a lounge. This lounge, based upon all the evidence discovered by Suriveth Varune, likely once belonged to the famed minstrel, Rowena, as evidenced by her Ice Harp that was left on a display wheel in the room. Later, when confronted by a mysterious dead end that likely contained a magical secret door, the adventures determined that perhaps the Ice Harp was needed to open it. When they doubled back, grabbed the Ice Harp and had Suriveth play a few notes, the secret door did not open but something else happened. The bard Rowena appeared!\n\nWhen Rowena appeared, she explained how she was living a new life with the beings known as the Protectors a race of eternal elves that provided magic to make the region of Moonwreck and Haven the pristine and beautiful place that it was. The evil that had corrupted the region was due to the Eye of Arik which had been accidentally brought in as an engagement gift to Princes Argenta for her upcoming wedding to Sir Ellis, the man who was seen riding the white dragon known as \u2018Flyght.\u2019 Further, she explained that a follower of the Diabolist, known as Carthus, was upstairs orchestrating this evil. Perhaps through an alliance with the entity known as \u2018Arik,\u2019 The Diabolist was trying to bring about the return of some sinister race.\n\nRowena could offer no more other than starting how the Eye of Arik could be destroyed. Either by bringing about Flyght (who was currently banished) or finding Ellis\u2019 sword or summoning her back by playing a few notes on the Ice Harp, these ways would destroy the Eye of Arik. With that, she returned to whatever realm she had come from and showed them the secret entrance to the top level of the castle.\n\nEpisode 14: Exploring the Castle\n\nThe members of the Half-Moon Exploring Company slowly approached the palace of Princess Argenta. The palace reflected the same state of decay and desolation that the rest of the Moonwreck area had previously shown. A red light seemed to bathe the entire area with much of it seemingly originating with the inner sanctum of the palace. Sir Bellivin, their newest ally, was more than willing to assist as he seemed to have some knowledge of the palace, having been present recently..\n\nAs they approached, a mysterious figure was seen near the palace gatehouse. The figure was short and squat which immediately made Glaedwin Longclef think of the dreaded derro they had previously encountered. Glaedwin, understandably on edge, called out, aiming his bow at the stranger. However, as it turned out, the stranger was not a foe, but in fact a local dwarf named Saerid Turquoise, who immediately showed his proficiency with lightning magic. Once they had discovered that this was an ally and once it was revealed that Saerid also had some exposure to the palace, they were more at ease. Asking him what he was doing here, he admitted that he was trying to determine what had gone wrong at the palace. Whereas he was not an eye witness to what had transpired, he certainly saw the skies to turn black and the lands begin to rot. Princess Argenta, long a beloved figure to the dwarves, needed to be saved if possible. Therefore, he agreed to come with the company. More importantly, Saerid did reveal that he, too, was a member of the Half-Moon Exploring Company, having been inducted when it was first founded, over 75 years ago, prior to Lucien Autumntide purchase of the organization. With this out of the way, the group proceeded towards the palace.\n\nSuriveth Varune tried to ask Saerid and Sir Bellivin whether there was another way into the palace, other than the gatehouse. However, when Sir Bellivin looked to see whether or not the entries he remembered were available, they appeared to be sealed with rubble, leaving only one way into the palace.\n\nExploring the palace, it was clear that there were various troops of orcs that had been present, using the gatehouse as their headquarters. However, Glaedwin determined they were out on patrol. The group used this as an opportunity to sneak in and steal some of the provisions that the orcs had marshaled. The gate which was currently closed was no match for Glaedwin who was able to slip through and throw the switch that raised the gate, allowing the rest of the adventurers to gain access.\n\nFrom this point, the company began exploring what was in the palace. Using Wolfram Delmanse to listen at the various doors and carefully opening those very doors, they began to carefully creep through the hallways. Whereas they were not overly surprised to discover evil creatures roaming through the palace, such as hobgblins and kobolds, they were surprised to come across a dining hall where all of those present were statutes. Whereas it was not certain whether they were people turned to stone or whether they were actual statutes, the evidence seemed to suggest the former. People seated at the table, in mid bite and with goblets in their hands as well as servants offering food, seemed to suggest that they were somehow doomed when the tragedy struck. Also present throughout the hallways and rooms was an ever present red light. The red light, while stationary, seemed to give off an eerie glow which was thought to be best handled by trying to avoid it.\n\nAfter the first hallway had been investigated, they found a passage that led to a cavernous area beneath the palace. This area was roughly designed with the rocks not truly carved. However, they did encounter a large white ape that was chained to the wall, clearly starving. Whereas it was aggressive when it saw the adventurers, it calmed once Suriveth fed the animal.\n\nEventually, they came across an underground spa that had some dangerous mutated bats which, upon further examination, seemed to be demonic in nature. But the two most interesting rooms where one in which there was a series of painted frescoes on the walls and floor, but also a strange keyhole in the floor. The next room had a pedestal containing a silver amulet which seemed out of place for this spa. When approached, a green mist formed into a face and gave a stern warning. For now, it was thought that it was best left alone.\n\nFinally, as they left the spa area and continued down the cavern, they came across an area that appeared to be some kind of shrine to elven spirit ancestors. However, the statutes and icons had been smashed, replaced by a simple clay statue with an eye that seemed to slowly blink. When Glaedwin attempted to destroy this seemingly evil shrine, the eye seemed to summon a horrific demonic creature. This creature, arguably the most most deadly and potent creature they had ever come across, had several arms and a giant mouth atop its head. The heroes were barely able to defeat the thing without losing their lives. As it died, it fell back on the eye, crushing it.\n\nAt this point they found another set of stairs that seemed to take them back to the main floor of the palace.\n\nEpisode 13: The Grip of Evil\nEvidence of evil shows itself\n\nAs the heroes progressed into the area known as Moonwreck, it was evident that a great cataclysm had come to the area, as they feared. They looked ... (truncated)",

        "text":"Gathering of An Army\n\nChapter One\n\nFor a hundred years, the humans of the east have lived in segregated farming settlements and mercanary strongholds with nothing but their need to fend off the savage races binding them. They had no plans to unite their people \u2013 Survival was their only viable dream. Things began to change once they realized that an unsteady order had fallen back into place in the lands. Roads of communication opened between settlements and people began to travel once more. With the gnomes and halflings traveling from the south, the humans found themselves once more gaining a foothold in the world, after being hunted like game by the drow and other savage clans. Though they were not yet a nation. Still a divided people struggling and surviving in small groups, unable to trust any but those immediately around them.\n\nHowever, now a new development has caused the people to rally and finally unify their forces. Years ago, rumours came from the grey fields that the divided clans of the savage races had begun to form truces, one small group at a time. These gangs were managable since most of these races themselves had suffered great loses during the War of Many. None of them were at their same power as they were centuries ago. Thus far, the outlying villages had managed to fend off any attackers and even carved out territorial boarders running along the deserts and towards the grey fields.\n\nOnly months ago, a new and much greater danger arose. This evil showed its numbers when they began to raid camps in the south edge, quickly ravaging the people as they marched their army north towards the edge of the Vale. Rumors began to spread of a shadow stretching for as far as the eye could see, dotted with the eyes of demons. Notice went out throughout the lands that it was time for man to rise up once more and defend this world. Now it is the responsability of these fighters, warriors, and brave commonfolk to search out and chase down the evils destroying their hopes of eventually taking back their home from the savages and of building a great nation once again.\n\nChapter Two\n\nSent into the mountains by a military desperate for any hope of survival, a group of soldiers, an Oracle, and a random adventurer picked up along the way trekked across fields, wastelands, hills and mountains. They fought ogres, lions and a basilisk. They were forced to infiltrate the enemy army in order to rescue a kidnapped ally. Many of them beheld the soft glow of the afterlife, just before being dragged back to the material world. Others instead embrassed the warmth of the basking light. Along the way, they managed to find a couple other adventurers in need of partnership to assure their survival in this world.\n\nNow, on the other side of the Breach Mountains, a group of once strangers, who possibly never would have even chosen a seat next to the other in a bar, find themselves staring into an unknown forest and vast wilderness. Their previous goal \u2013 to stay alive \u2013 has been accomplished, but they now become aware that they are alone, with no allies and a possibly vast number of enemies, with no clear designation.\n\nChapter Three\n\nSoon after the main force of the Skaldernian army made its way into the vastness of the desert in pursuit of the Dark Army, the outlying villages and farms began to rebuild their settlements as people returned to their homes. However, they had little time to settle back in as a new, much more menacing threat swept across the fields. Like locusts, swashes of undead hordes came in waves, destroying the body of every man, woman and child that came within their reach. Hearing of this plague making its way across the country, the citizens of Skalderna began leaving their homes, en masse traveling to the relative safety behind the walls of Langen. So while the people\u2019s spirit rebounded against the power of the Master, they now had no choice but to cower and hope that something will save them from the current scourge.\n\nConvinced that this new threat was brought on by the powers of a powerful mage, or perhaps several working in league with this \u201cDark Master\u201d, the collective council (made up of the leaders of the largest cities within Skalderna) decided that once and for all magic must not just be shunned upon, but outlawed entirely. No longer would it simply carry a stigma and those cursed with its touch be outcasted; now they would be hunted and sentence brought against them for the crimes they had obviously committed, or to keep them from the horrors that they would eventually commit after being corrupted by their power. The council sanctioned witch hunters to seek out those who would practice the arcane, while the churches also provided their own inquisitors whom they had trained for similar situations.\n\nMeanwhile, the people of the Shoanti tribes within the ever-burning desert were in a similar situation. They found themselves in an unfortunate battle with the people whom they would hope to someday call ally. However, while the warriors are well equipped for battle and the shaman well versed in the rites of the dead, neither are prepared to battle with the dead. What was once the Skaldernian army tasked with hunting down the Dark Army had now transformed into a group marching on the people of the desert; their bodies now simply an empty husk. With this undead army encroaching on their territories, they have had no choice but to leave their home and find haven in the mountains. The decided that the best place for was where their spirits and ancestors could guide and protect them; Storval. The Elder lead them through the grounds, the maze-like pillars, plateaus, and valleys making it impossible for the army to follow them.\n\nFrom a distance, small pillars of white smoke can be seen coming from the crevasses of the Breach.\n\nYou can listen to our sessions at our website ( ) or directly through our RSS feed.\n\nWhy not follow us on Twitter with @DragonFisters or Like us on Facebook.\n\nGathering of An Army\n\nKiloGex Blog header 750 ReRow A_Trip_Alone octraine14 DFShade DFPepper Darksinister669 TRevorsaur",

        "text":"Chapter - 73: Afternoon Tea\nPrevious chapter\nNext chapter\n\nAfter eating a hearty lunch, each member of the family was drinking an afternoon tea while having a vast conversation.\n\nMasashi lacked interest in this sort of boring family meeting, and if he were to choose, he would rather take an afternoon nap.\n\nAmy sat down next to him refreshingly watching TV. It seems like after the kid had cried, her mood had become a lot better.\n\nRolando along with Alice and two other young men were having a conversation, perhaps it\u2019s a common characteristic as a businessman, as the chat naturally changed to business.\n\nOn the other hand, that young man named Dima seemed very interested in Masashi. Talking casually, and asking him insignificant matters. Masashi was already a sophisticated man, so it was natural that his answers were diligent.\n\nWhile they were having a conversation, sitting on the other side of Adams were seven or eight young men, who suddenly stood up and walked out.\n\n\u201cBrother, Adams said that he wanted to play billiards, I wonder if you\u2019re interested?\u201d The gentle Murphy came and said to Rolando.\n\n\u201cBilliards? I haven\u2019t played for a long time, do you guys want to see?\u201d Rolando stood up a little interested.\n\nSeveral young people didn\u2019t say anything and just followed to stand.\n\n\u201cLei Yin, you can go,\u201d Alice said to him.\n\nMasashi nodded, and also followed to stand.\n\nSeeing Masashi go out, Amy ran over and pulled his clothes.\n\n\u201cKid, have you seen people play billiards?\u201d Masashi asked while walking.\n\nThe little girl didn\u2019t say anything, and just stared at him.\n\nMasashi smiled, pinching her little fact then continued to walk.\n\nArriving at the east side of the mansion, he saw that in a huge room were two big tables, hanging on the wall near the table was a flying target. In the innermost corner was a bar full of bottles.\n\nThe furniture in the room was like a typical high-class bar.\n\nMasashi suspected that this should be the ornaments that Rolando and his brother\u2019s father Winslow-Dai Fei left behind, as Rolando was too serious, so he shouldn\u2019t have this kind of leisurely place.\n\nJust like the nobles of the British society, the game to play was billiard. However, very few people of the Swiss upper class choose American billiards, and instead the general choice was snooker.\n\nThere the dozen people were divided into two groups, each occupying a table.\n\nIn upper circles of society, nothing is accidental. Even such a simple grouping, one can clearly see the difference.\n\nRolando the three brothers, Dima and two other young people that were standing in front at the funeral, were naturally grouped together. Needless to say, these people were all a family member, regardless of status were wealthy prominent members.\n\nAt the other table, were young people that were far inferior in these aspects.\n\nBecause of being the former master of the house Meng Zhuoer\u2019s former confidant and right-hand man, Alice was also assigned to Rolando\u2019s group.\n\nBut seeing that Adams was a skilled player. Not long after starting had connected several balls ahead of Murphy and Dima approximately 50 degrees. Seeing her guy play so well, the blonde continuously applauded.\n\n\u201cWhat fun is this kind of dry game, why don\u2019t we bet?\u201d When it was Murphy\u2019s turn to bat, Adams at the side said.\n\n\u201cHow much do you want?\u201d Dima asked, smiling.\n\n\u201cHow about 100 Swiss Francs?\u201d Adams after gracefully having a sip of red wine said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t oppose,\u201d Dima said with a shrug.\n\n\u201cMurphy, how about you?\u201d Adams looked at his brother.\n\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d The quiet young man nodded.\n\nRolando, for such a thing, didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nAfter about half an hour, after two games, the winner was Adams. Quite an exciting game attracted a lot of people to come and watch.\n\nReceiving two checks from both Dima and Murphy, he was very proud of himself, then hugged and kissed the blonde beauty.\n\n\u201cAnother game,\u201d Adams said with a smile\n\n\u201cI want to take a break. Who want to play?\u201d Dima asked several other youths.\n\nSeeing that nobody wanted to play, made Adams more proud, and glanced around, locking his eyes on the Asian-boy leisurely drinking wine.\n\n\u201cMr. Lei Yin, do you have any interest to play the next round?\u201d Adams walked two steps away from the youth and asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very good,\u201d Masashi said, laughing lightly.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll be lenient.\u201d Adam\u2019s words caused the blonde beauty to chuckle.\n\nMasashi smiled, putting his glass down, \u201cWell, please be lenient.\u201d\n\nWhen Masashi selected a club, Adams said to him: \u201cMr. Lei Yin, let\u2019s bet to stimulate the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso good, how much do you want?\u201d Masashi turned to look at him.\n\n\u201cWhat about a thousand Swiss francs?\u201d Adams said.\n\n\u201cAdams, the stakes are too high.\u201d Hearing him, Rolando frowned.\n\n\u201cBrother, this is me and Mr. Lei Yin\u2019s game, he hasn\u2019t said anything yet, how do you know he wouldn\u2019t agree?\u201d Adams said cheerfully.\n\nA flash of anger appeared on Rolando\u2019s eyes, he turned to Masashi and said: \u201cMr. Lei Yin, you are a guest, you don\u2019t have to bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, 1000 Swiss francs is nothing, right? I don\u2019t have any issue with it, I accept.\u201d Contrary to the two brother\u2019s expectations, Masashi actually agreed.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go ahead, Mr. Lei Yin.\u201d Relative to Rolando\u2019s dissatisfaction, Adams revealed a proud look on his face.\n\nAfter Masashi had selected a club, he nodded.\n\n\u201cMr. Lei Yin is a guest, please go first.\u201d Adams made a gesture to invite him.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll be blunt.\u201d Masashi went to the front table, then bent over in an extremely unprofessional position aimed at the cue ball.\n\nSeeing him like this, many people couldn\u2019t help but laugh, but endured not to laugh.\n\nAlice felt very puzzled, watching Masashi\u2019s position, it was clear the he was not a professional, so why would he promise to bet?\n\n\u201cPow!\u201d A light sound, Masashi hit the ball out. Although he used a considerable amount of strength, the ball entered a bag.\n\nMasashi gave a strange little look at the club and then looked at the balls on the table, revealing a little bit confused look.\n\n\u201cIt seems Mr. Lei Yin doesn\u2019t have luck,\u201d Adams said with a smile.\n\n\u201cI think so too because this game usually starts with hitting the first ball.\u201d Murphy on behalf of Masashi said.\n\nThe onlooker knew that he needed to hit the first ball, but the ball was clearly too intense, as even the youth\u2019s batting posture was a bit funny.\n\nAdams walked passed him to the table\u2019s edge and then having very different posture than that of Masashi, very elegantly aimed at a ball.\n\nHitting three balls, Adams successfully scored three balls in a pocket. He somewhat proudly looked at Masashi, only to find out that he didn\u2019t even look at his play, and was absorbed in looking at the club.\n\nFreak! Adams swore in his heart, then bent down to continue his play.\n\nThe fifth ball, Adams played a little bit too hard, resulting in the ball missing the pocket. But for this result, he had no dissatisfaction, after all, the opponent was not a professional, giving him two or three opportunities doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cMr. Lei Yin, you hit.\u201d Murphy kindly reminded Masashi, who was carefully looking at his club.\n\n\u201cI know, thank you.\u201d Masashi stood up, walked up to the side of the table.\n\nWith that kind of ugly posture, the people around couldn\u2019t help but laugh, the Asian-teenager aiming at a red ball, didn\u2019t hit for a long time.\n\nJust when Adams was about to mock him, a \u201cpow\u201d sound resounded, the teenager finally hit.\n\nAs the white cue ball rolled slowly, everyone thought the ball would stop because of the lack of strength, but it still continued, and the ball was slowly rolling towards the red ball.\n\n\u201cPA\u201d a gentle percussive sound, the red ball was hit by the cue ball, then rolled to the bag, going into the pocket.\n\nEveryone invariably swore in their heart, \u201cshit,\u201d Adams had an indifferent look.\n\nNext, the teenager went to the other side of the table, bending, aiming, hitting, after completing these three movements, he unexpectedly hit another ball.\n\nThe people around sighed and thought that this fellow\u2019s luck was indeed good.\n\nBut when the third red ball was struck into the pocket, Adams showed a vigilant look.\n\nThen, the fourth and the fifth, went into the pocket, while the ball was driven next to the sixth ball, no one dared to laugh. Everyone couldn\u2019t believe it, looking at the teenager continually using an ugly posture to hit the ball on the table into the pocket.\n\nWhen he hit the fourth ball, the youth had to look around before shooting, and then each shot would put a ball into the packet. Afterward, besides Adams, everyone was looking joyfully at the youth\u2019s individual performances. There were even a few that seemed almost impossible to get to play the ball, and it was like a teenager performing magic and easily putting it into the pocket.\n\nFor a time, the room was constantly ringing, and everyone couldn\u2019t help but give a warm applause.\n\n\u201cMr. Lei Yin, this is your bet.\u201d After the game, Adams handed a cheque to Masashi.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t played in a while, and I feel a bit rusty. That\u2019s why at the start I said I don\u2019t play well.\u201d Masashi said as he put the check in his pocket. Masashi was not deceiving him; he hasn\u2019t played this game for nearly three decades.\n\n\u201cMr. Lei Yin is implicitly kind. I didn\u2019t imagine you were an expert billiard player.\u201d Adams said in a strange tone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a master, but just slightly stronger than some professional. If there\u2019s nothing else, then excuse me.\u201d Then, Masashi turned around and left the room.\n\nAdams looked very viciously at Masashi\u2019s back, tightly squeezing his hands into fists until it turned white.\n\nPrevious chapter\nBack to menu\nNext chapter",

Father wishes to meet with us here in Cyrkensia. It's his favorite town in all of Nestra.\n  \u2022 Avatar: But isn't it dangerous for Father to travel to a place like this?\n  \u2022 Camilla: It's fine. Father comes here often, and nothing bad has ever happened. Nestra is neutral territory, so you need not fear unless you try to start a fight.\n  \u2022 Avatar: Oh, I see. So we should all be safe here. That's a relief.\n  \u2022 Leo: It's always best to remain on guard. Stay on your toes, Avatar. This territory may be neutral, but there might be unruly Hoshidans about.\n  \u2022 Avatar: Leo!!\n  \u2022 Leo: Long time no see, Brother\/Sister.\n  \u2022 Avatar: I'm so happy to see you! Did you finish Father's mission already?\n  \u2022 Leo: For the most part. All that's left is to guard Father during his time here. After that, I'm free to do as I please. That means I'll be joining you.\n  \u2022 Avatar: Thank you, Leo. I'll feel much better with you on our team.\n  \u2022 Odin: Milord! You've finally arrived! I\u2019ve been so worried... My mind has been spiraling intro a dark abyss ever since we parted!\n  \u2022 Niles: It's nice to have you back. While you were doing the king's bidding we couldn't help but wonder what awful trials he was forcing you to endure. We've been terribly worried.\n  \u2022 Leo: Whoa! This has gotten way too mushy way too fast!! I appreciate your concern, both of you, but give me some breathing room!\n  \u2022 Odin: Heh, sorry...\n  \u2022 Niles: As you wish, milord.\n  \u2022 Leo: If you are quite finished, Father should be here shortly. I'm expected to be at the theatre well before he arrives. If you'll excuse me...\n  \u2022 Avatar: The theatre? What theatre?\n  \u2022 Leo: Ah, that's right. This is your first time in the fair town of Cyrkensia. This place is known for its incredible singers and dancers. They always put on a big performance whenever Father comes to visit.\n  \u2022 Avatar: That's interesting... Sounds exciting.\n  \u2022 Leo: If you're free, you should take the time to watch. It's sure to be breathtaking. Even warriors need to rest now and then. Just don't get carried away. Anyway, I really must be going. I'll catch up with you later!\n  \u2022 Avatar: Bye, Leo!\n\n(Leo leaves)\n\n  \u2022 Avatar: It's so hard to put up a front when I'm still reeling from the tragedy in Cheve. As fun as it sounds, I'm in no mood for a show right now. Maybe Hans was lying. It's possible Father didn't really intend for us to... I'll ask him about it whenever I get the chance. I need to know. And if he did give the order, maybe I can convince him there's a better way.\n\n(Scene transitions to a water-filled opera house, where the spectators seat in boats)\n\n  \u2022 Avatar: Wow! THIS is Cyrkensia's opera house?! It's incredible...\n  \u2022 Leo: Avatar! Over here!\n  \u2022 Avatar: There you are, Leo! I'm glad I finally found you. I've never seen such a huge crowd.\n  \u2022 Leo: It's something else, isn't it? You're just in time. Father arrived moments ago. Father... Avatar is here.\n  \u2022 Garon: ...\n  \u2022 Avatar: Father...\n  \u2022 Garon: Avatar, I have received word about the incident in Cheve. I am told you eradicated the rebels, as well as the unarmed townspeople.\n  \u2022 Avatar: Father, let me explain...\n  \u2022 Garon: You did well, Avatar.\n  \u2022 Avatar: Huh?!\n  \u2022 Garon: When I heard that your group destroyed Cheve, I couldn't have been prouder. Rebellions are like seeds. One must salt the earth before they sprout. I knew you'd eventually come around and learn to accept my method of ruling. I'm told you even enjoyed watching the life spark fade from the injured rebel soldiers. Hans praised you highly for displaying behavior befitting a Nohrian royal.\n  \u2022 Avatar: But, Father... That's not true! Why would Hans say that?! I need to talk to you about what happened in Cheve. If you'll please allow me to\u2013\n  \u2022 Iago: Lord\/Lady Avatar, the performance is about to begin. Please take your seat.\n  \u2022 Avatar: But\u2013\n  \u2022 Iago: Such an important show cannot be delayed for one person, even a prince\/princess. You can discuss your newfound Nohrian pride with King Garon later.\n  \u2022 Leo: What's wrong, Brother\/Sister? Did something happen in Cheve?\n  \u2022 Avatar: Yes, Leo... Something awful. But I suppose I'll have to discuss it with Father later.\n  \u2022 Leo: Yes I'm afraid so. We can't keep the performers waiting. Your seat is right over there. Please hurry\u2013it's about to begin.\n  \u2022 Avatar: OK, I'm going. I'll fill you in later, Leo.\n\n(Leo leaves)\n\n  \u2022 Avatar: Huh... It occurs to me I haven't seen Azura in a while. She would love to see this... I hope she found a seat elsewhere.\n\nCutscene: Dark SongEdit\n\n(Azura appears in the center of the stage wearing dark clothing and a veil that covers most of her face. She then begins to sing and dance, each of her movements leaving a trail of water in the air)\n\n  \u2022 Azura: Embrace the dark you call a home, \u266a Gaze upon an empty, white throne...\n\n(Scene briefly shifts to Garon's seat and the returns to Azura)\n\n  \u2022 Azura: A legacy of lies, \u266a A familiar disguise... Sing with me a song of conquest and fate... \u266a\n\n(Scene briefly shifts to Garon, who begins to clench his teeth)\n\n  \u2022 Azura: The black pillar cracks beneath its weight...\n\n(The trails of water begin to cover the entire opera house.\u00a0Scene briefly shifts to Garon, who begins to clench his fists and to groan)\n\n  \u2022 Azura: Night breaks through the day, hard as a stone \u266a\u00a0Lost in thoughts all alone.\n\n(Garon continues with more groans of increasing discomfort)\n(Movie ends)\n\n  \u2022 Garon: Argh... Urgh...!!\n  \u2022 Iago: My king! What's wrong?! King Garon!! Soldiers! Capture that performer! Do it NOW! Her song may have been a curse of some kind...\n  \u2022 Avatar: A curse?! Father...\n  \u2022 Leo: Avatar! Hurry, we need to catch that singer! Huh?! The stage... It's empty.\n  \u2022 Avatar: Did she get away?! Well, she couldn't have gotten far. Let's hurry!\n  \u2022 Leo: Right!\n  \u2022 Kumagera: Stop right there, Nohrians.\n\n(Hoshidan troops appear)\n\n  \u2022 Avatar: Hoshidan soldiers?!\n  \u2022 Kumagera: Back away if you wish to live. This war ends now... And the way to peace begins with the Nohrian king's death.\n  \u2022 Avatar: You intend to buy peace with death? That's madness!\n  \u2022 Leo: So the Hoshidans are responsible for that singer's curse. I should have known.\n  \u2022 Kumagera: Singer? Curse? What are you rambling on about?\n  \u2022 Leo: Don't play dumb. One of your underlings performed a cursed song to hurt our father!\n  \u2022 Kumagera: I have no idea what you're referring to, nor do I care. Leave it to a filthy Nohrian to fabricate a story to try and distract us.\n  \u2022 Leo: You're a liar and a coward! I won't let you get away with this!\n\n(Azura appears in her normal clothing)\n\n  \u2022 Azura: Avatar, what's going on?!\n  \u2022 Avatar: Azura! Where have you been?\n  \u2022 Azura: Sorry I'm late. I wasn't feeling well, so I went outside to get some air. Why are there Hoshidan soldiers here?\n  \u2022 Avatar: They've come to kill father. They used some strange song to incapacitate him. Oh! While you were outside, did you see a strange woman fleeing the opera house?\n  \u2022 Azura: ...No. I did not.\n  \u2022 Kumagera: So you refuse to back down, eh? We'll just have to kill you all! Troops! Prepare to attack!\n  \u2022 Leo: Dammit... We have no choice. We'll have to fight them off!\n  \u2022 Avatar: Let's do this.\n\nBattle BeginsEdit\n\n  \u2022 Keaton: *sigh* I've made a real mess for myself. I came down the mountain to gather bugs for my collection, but now I'm lost... Hm? What's going on over there? I thought I heard a ruckus, but wow, that's a lot of people. Hmm... HMM... Ah! That guy\/lady looks nice. I'll ask him\/her for directions back up the mountain. I may have a horrible sense of direction, but I'm a great judge of character!\n\n(The Avatar interacts with Keaton)\n\n  \u2022 Keaton: Hey, you! Yeah, you with the sword and the hair and stuff!!\n  \u2022 Avatar: WHAA! Wh-why does that man have a tail?!\n  \u2022 Keaton: Wow, really? That's really how you're gonna play this? I thought you looked like a nice guy\/lady, but you clearly have issues... For the record, I am NOT a man with a tail. I'm a wolfskin, and proud of it.\n  \u2022 Avatar: Wolfskin? Sorry, but what's that?\n  \u2022 Keaton: Seriously? Have you been living in isolation your whole life or what?\n  \u2022 Avatar: Actually...\n  \u2022 Keaton: As a wolfskin, I can transform into a wolf by using a beaststone. Pretty killer, eh?\n  \u2022 Avatar: Wow, it really is! Sorry, I've lived a rather...sheltered life. I hope I didn't offend you. May I ask what you're doing here?\n  \u2022 Keaton: Well, I'm sort of...just a bit...unsure of my whereabouts. I can't find my way home. I was thinking maybe...ya could help a fella out?\n  \u2022 Avatar: Ah, so that's why you called out to me. You're lost, poor thing.\n  \u2022 Keaton: No! No... I mean...maybe. I'm maybe just a little lost. but mostly not lost at all. It's complicated.\n  \u2022 Avatar: Sorry, but I actually don't know this area, much less the way back to your home.\n  \u2022 Keaton: Oh, I see. well, whatever. I can manage on my own. I'll be fine...\n  \u2022 Avatar: Wait! Why don't you join my team? You can stick with us until you find your way home. You seem like you'd be a great ally. What do you say?\n  \u2022 Keaton: Join your group... Hmm... Well, I could find my way home anytime I wanted. Let's get that clear. But if you really think I'd be helpful, I can't very well turn you down.\n  \u2022 Avatar: Ha, your tail is wagging! Does that mean you're happy right now? Happy to join us?\n  \u2022 Keaton: My tail is NOT wagging! It's not! Got it?! Anyway, I guess it's settled. Nice to know ya! The name's Keaton. As a token of our new friendship, I'd like you to have this treasure I came across.\n  \u2022 Avatar: It's ball...?!\n  \u2022 Keaton: Heh heh, gorgeous, ain't it? Best one I've seen in ages. No need to thank me. As my new pal, I'm entrusting this gem to you. You better take good care of it, or else!\n  \u2022 Avatar: Thanks... (truncated)",
