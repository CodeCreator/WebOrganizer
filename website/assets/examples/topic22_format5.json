        "text":"Get information that is essential for all newcomers to Canada\n\nViewed 4456 Times 0 Comments\n\nYour foreign driver\u2019s licence may be valid for only three to six months after you arrive in Canada. So it is wise to get an international driver\u2019s license before you leave your home country. Regardless, you will eventually need to take a driving test to obtain a Canadian driver\u2019s licence.\n\nLicences are issued by the province or territory in which you live. In order to receive a licence, you must pass several tests: a vision test, a written examination and a road test. In some provinces, a minimum of 30 days is required between writing the knowledge test and taking a road test.\n\nI drove in my homeland for 24 years and yet I still flunked the knowledge test and barely passed the road test here, so I\u2019d recommend studying for your test and taking some driving lessons again. It will make the process easier.\n\nAlso, you must be at least 16 years old before you can be tested for a driver\u2019s licence in Canada. Some provinces have a graduated licensing system whereby young drivers can be restricted to driving only in daylight hours during their probation period.\n\nWhen applying for a driver\u2019s licence, the following documents may be necessary for proof of name, signature and address: \u00a6A passport \u00a6A Permanent Resident (PR) Card \u00a6Proof of address (bank statement or other public office received mail) \u00a6A driver\u2019s licence from your home country, but an international driver\u2019s licence is best\n\nIncidentally, a driver\u2019s licence is one of the best pieces of identification you can have, since it shows your photograph, signature and address.\n\nWas this answer helpful ?

During this time, you need to accumulate 25,000 Tier Miles or take 25 qualifying flights to remain in Silver, 50,000 Tier Miles or 50 qualifying flights to remain in Gold, and 150,000 Tier Miles to remain in Platinum.\n\nIf you have not managed to stay in your tier after your review date, you will move back to the previous tier. The rolling-tier qualification system will resume, meaning we give you a review opportunity every month over the subsequent 12 to 13 months to allow you to regain your status.\n\n*A \"qualifying flight\" is a flight on Emirates (or a codeshare flight marketed by Emirates but operated by another airline) between the point of origin and point of destination of an outward or round-trip journey.\n\nCall us\n\nFlights and Emirates services\n\nPlease call this number for flights, Chauffeur-drive, Dubai Stopovers and other Emirates services related queries.\n\nHotel reservations\n\nPlease call this number for hotel reservation queries only (except Dubai Stopovers).
