        "text":"Numbers Game\nA decade of dominance\nHuw Richards\nOctober 23, 2012\nEngland's Mike Tindall celebrates their win over the All Blacks, England v New Zealand, Twickenham, November 9, 2002\nEngland celebrate their win over the All Blacks in 2002 \u00a9 Getty Images\nRelated Links\nNumbers Game: The non-scoring winger\nNumbers Game: A cut above the rest\n\nSo well established is the autumn international programme in rugby's contemporary calendar that it comes as a shock to recall that, like the Heineken Cup, it is less than 20 years old and a product of the game's professional era.\n\nThe forces that got all of the southern hemisphere's giants visiting most years were those which dominated the somewhat panicky years of the new settlement - a desperate search for new income with which to fund vastly increased costs. Only an extended international programme could be counted upon to do that.\n\nSo it is that when autumn matches resume this month after their World Cup year sabbatical in 2011, fans in Europe will be able to see not only the Boks, All Blacks and Wallabies, but the Pumas, Fiji and Samoa.\n\nThe extent of the transformation can be seen by comparing international records pre and post 1995. When Ireland entertain South Africa at the Aviva Stadium on November 10, it will be the 119th clash between one of the former Five Nations and one of the three traditional southern giants since 1995, an average of seven matches per year over 17 years.\n\nThe 90 years between the pioneering All Blacks and the change of 1995 saw 148 matches, an average of 1.64 per year, or less than a quarter of the rate of more recent teams. Take out the years lost to war, and the average still comes out at less than two.\n\nWhat has not changed is a pattern of southern dominance. We get reminded of it much more frequently when all three visit most years, compared to the pattern of one each per decade that held until the 1970s, but there's not a massive difference between pre and post 1995 results. The southern trio won 93 and lost 47, with 8 draws of the pre-professional matches. They've done a little better since 1995, winning 81 to 32 with five draws, but there is only a five per cent difference - 70.76% against 65.54 - in their winning percentage. Those five draws, three involving Australia and two New Zealand, are a genuine oddity given that the drawn game has become such a rarity in modern rugby.\n\nAs so often with historical statistics, the breathtaking element is the dominance of the All Blacks. Over the entire period, their winning record as an away team against the Five Nations has been 82.96%. They have played 91 matches and won 73, with only 13 defeats. So great a collector's item is an All Black defeat that well-informed fans of the winning teams can usually reel off the years - 1905, 1935 and 1953 for Wales, 1936, 1983, 1993 and 2002 for England.\n\nOn November 9 they will complete a decade since they lost away to any of the Five Nations (the loss against France in the 2007 World Cup was on neutral ground, in Wales).\n\nThat is also long enough for most of us to have forgotten that this most recent loss was against an immensely strong England squad missing only one man - Josh Lewsey - of the 15 who started the World Cup final a year later, while All Black coach John Mitchell had chosen to bring an experimental squad and handed debuts to seven players, of whom only Andrew Hore and Ali Williams were to have long international careers. Even then they scored four tries to three and led by 12 points before a late England revival.\n\nAll Blacks' record in the autumn internationals\nOpposition Win Lose Draw Overall %age\nWales 7 0 0 100%\nIreland 5 0 0 100%\nScotland 4 0 0 100%\nEngland 6 1 1 75%\nFrance 6 2 1 72.2%\n\nSouth Africa has been the second most successful visitor, while playing fewer matches because there were none between 1974 and 1992. They have won 53 and lost 23 of their 80 matches for a 68.75% success record. Australia brings up the rear with 52.63%, 48 wins to 43 defeats in 95 matches.\n\nWhat has changed between the pre and post 1995 eras is the relative fortunes of the teams. New Zealand had the best record to 1995, but not by much - 79.09% to South Africa's 76.31, which included a 23-match unbeaten run between losses to Scotland in 1906 and Ireland in 1965, while Australia lost more matches than they won for a 44.55% record.\n\nNew Zealand's professional record is little sort of stupefying, only three defeats - England in 2002, France in 1995 and 2000 - in 36 matches, of which 31 have been won and two drawn, a success rate of 88.89%. Australia has done much better, and its 63.75% from 40 matches just edges out the Springboks' 63.41% from 42, of which 26 have been won.\n\nAmong the battered hosts, England and France have the best records, both just over 40%. England have a marginal edge, but will lose it - albeit with a chance to leapfrog back a week later - should France beat Australia on November 10.\n\nFrance, with 12 wins in 21 matches, have the best record against Australia and their six wins in 23 is comfortably the best against New Zealand. England, with eight wins and a draw in 18 matches, have been far by the Springboks' most troublesome adversary.\n\nSouth Africa celebrate victory while Wales lament defeat, Wales v South Africa, Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, Wales, November 13, 2010\nThe sight of South Africa celebrating at the MIllennium Stadium is nothing new \u00a9 Getty Images\n\nScotland was little behind France and England pre-1995, but has struggled since, winning only three out of 21 matches to drop its all-time percentage to 27.08%. Ireland had by far the worst pre-1995 record but has done much better since, including a 50% record against the Springboks to raise its overall record to 24.41%.\n\nThat leaves Wales, most unusually for an all-time Five Nations table, in last place on 24.07%, weighed down by an abysmal record against South Africa - with only a single victory, in a half-completed Millennium Stadium in 1998, in 16 meetings. Three wins and a draw from 26 matches mean they edge out Scotland as the most accommodating hosts of the professional era.\n\nEngland's record of 43.33% since 1995 conceals the one period in which a European team has truly dominated Southern visitors. Their record as host during Clive Woodward's period as coach (1997 to 2004, when his resignation coming ahead of the autumn matches in 2004) was P14 W8 D2 L4, a success rate of 64.29%. Their record otherwise in professional times has been a slightly less impressive four wins from 16 matches, or 25%.\n\nThree wins from nine meetings this autumn would hold up Europe's rather unimpressive historic average, and indeed slightly improve the professional record. Both history and current form suggest those defeats are likelier to be inflicted on Australia or South Africa.\n\nAny All Black defeat, particularly if they go down for the first time ever to Scotland or the first in 59 years to Wales, would go straight into rugby history. On average they go down roughly once every eight and a quarter years - 13 times in 107 years. But looked at another way, they're due, given the decade that has elapsed since they went down at Twickenham in November 2002.\n\n\u00a9 ESPN Sports Media Ltd.\n\nLive Sports\n\nCommunication error please reload the page.\n\n  \u2022 Football\n\n  \u2022 Cricket\n\n  \u2022 Rugby\n\n    \u2022 Days\n    \u2022 Hrs\n    \u2022 Mins\n    \u2022 Secs\n\n    F1 - Italian GP\n\n  \u2022 OtherLive >>\n\n    Snooker - China Open\n    Tennis - Miami Open",

        "text":"\u2022 For the Astros to become the 2017 World Series champions, they needed to do plenty of losing first. It all started with George Springer, and now Houston has a club feared by all after winning its first title.\nBy Ben Reiter\nNovember 07, 2017\n\nIt all sprang from Springer. Anyone with the Astros will tell you that. When Jeff Luhnow and his crew of rebuilders arrived in Houston before the 2012 season, wielding both sledgehammers and X-Acto knives, George Springer was already on site. Not in Houston; he was still two years from reaching the big leagues.playing centerfield for the High A Lancaster (Calif.) JetHawks after Ed Wade\u2019s ousted regime had drafted him 11th in June \u201911, Spinger was the shiny copper piping that anyone would know to salvage from even the most dilapidated structure before the wrecking ball hits.\n\nSecond baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve and lefthander Dallas Keuchel were there too, and the new leadership was smart enough not to dispense with them either\u2014even though back then they looked like little more than a slap hitter and a soft tosser. But Springer, who had battled through a childhood stutter to become a polished prospect at Connecticut, was a five-tool phenom. If the members of the front office allowed themselves to dream of a championship, he was the person they imagined raising the trophy.\n\nWhen Sports Illustrated predicted four Junes ago that the event would occur this autumn, Springer graced the cover, not only because his swing was so photogenic\u2014especially in the Astros\u2019 throwback, rainbow-striped uniforms\u2014but also because he was the most likely player to make the moment happen. And he did.\n\nSpringer, 28, scuffled badly through a victory over the Yankees in the ALCS, and that continued through Game 1 of the World Series against the Dodgers. In those eight games he had just three singles in 30 at bats, with four walks against 11 strikeouts. But manager A.J. Hinch continued to believe in Springer\u2014the Astros once sold T-shirts in their gift shops that read simply process\u2014and kept him at the top of the lineup. \u201cGeorge Springer has way more good days than bad days,\u201d Hinch said before Game\u00a02 in Los\u00a0Angeles, \u201cand way more good stretches than bad stretches.\u201d\n\nPurchase Sports Illustrated's Commemorative Astros Covers, Issues\n\nThen a good stretch began for Springer, one that still hasn\u2019t stopped. He was named the World Series MVP moments after the Astros\u2019 5\u20131 thrashing of the Dodgers in Game\u00a07, and there was no other choice. He had eight extra base hits, a World Series record. He accumulated 29 total bases, another record. He hit five home runs, tying a record. He became the only player to homer in four straight games of a Series\u2014the last four. Everything ran through him. \u201cA crazy journey,\u201d Springer said amid the cigar smoke and champagne fumes in the Dodger Stadium clubhouse, four hours after he had chased Yu Darvish with a two-run, second-inning blast. \u201cA wild ride. The organization has come so far in three years.\u201d\n\n\nThe disturbing part, for the rest of baseball, is that the Astros\u2019 road to success was not designed to end now. In 2014, Springer\u2019s rookie season, they lost 92 games\u2014a welcome development after a historically appalling run in which they had dropped 106, then 107, then 111. (\u201cThrough the lean years,\u201d Keuchel says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have even wanted to come as a fan.\u201d) But if their 162\u2013324 record between \u201911 and \u201913 represented the nadir, then \u201917 alone was never meant to represent the summit, but the first peak in a dense range.\n\nIt\u2019s harder than ever to win back-to-back titles, in a wild-card era with an exhausting and randomizing playoff structure. The Yankees won three in a row, from 1998 through 2000, but they stand alone since Bud Selig expanded the postseason to three rounds in 1994, then four in 2012. If any team is built to repeat, though, it\u2019s Houston.\n\nStart with the offense, MLB\u2019s highest-scoring, which came close to accomplishing the rare feat of finishing first in homers (the Astros trailed the Yankees by three) and last in strikeouts (which they were), in an era in which most teams must accept the tradeoff of whiffs for power. Their first four batters\u2014Springer, third baseman Alex Bregman, Altuve and shortstop Carlos Correa\u2014are all 28 or younger. Bregman, who already has an extra-innings World Series walk-off, and Correa, whose own storybook month ended with a televised on-field proposal to his girlfriend after Game\u00a07, are just 23. Altuve\u2014the likely AL MVP\u2014won\u2019t reach free agency until 2020, Springer until \u201921, Correa until \u201922 and Bregman until \u201923, so far off that the World Series might then be between cyborgs.\n\nIn fact, Houston\u2019s only free-agent hitters are outfielder Cameron Maybin, a late-season addition to the bench, and the 40-year-old Carlos Beltr\u00e1n, who for $16\u00a0million this year provided more in the way of wisdom and discipline than production\u2014though his wisdom and discipline were invaluable\u2014and who departs, perhaps for retirement, with the ring he\u2019s sought for so long. \u201cIt only took 20 years to get to this position,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said on the field after Game 7, a championship cap on his head and his young son, who kept playing with his father\u2019s ear, in his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s a great future here. You look at the ball club, you look at every position, you see guys that can be impact players for a long time.\u201d\n\nWith a payroll that, at just under $150\u00a0million, ranked 16th in baseball\u2014the Dodgers\u2019, at $265 million, was 77% higher\u2014the Astros have the wherewithal to add a major free agent, someone with Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s savvy but a livelier bat. In the short term, Hinch can get increased use out of multitool outfielder Derek Fisher, 24; in the slightly longer term he\u2019ll have 20-year-old Kyle Tucker, a top\u00a010 prospect. Both bat from the left side, which is important, as the core four at the top of the order all swing from the right. That\u2019s no coincidence. Everything is by design.\n\nSo consider the rotation covered, too. Keuchel and Charlie Morton\u2014the previously unremarkable 33-year-old righty who began the season by signing a two-year, $14 million free-agent contract that astonished observers, and ended it by throwing four relief innings of one-run, two-hit ball in Game 7\u2014are both on board for next year. All-Star Lance McCullers\u00a0Jr., 24, the curveballing Game 7 starter, is under control until 2022. Behind them is a pair of quickly rising prospects: 20-year-old Forrest Whitley, a 6'\u20087\" righty who struck out nearly 14 batters per nine in the minors this year; and righty Francis Martes, 21, who pitched mostly in relief for the big club this summer after being deemed the game\u2019s 15th-best prospect by Baseball America last winter.\n\nSports Illustrated Selling Limited Edition Reprint of Prophetic 2014 Astros Issue\n\nThe key, in the near term, is Justin Verlander, whom Houston acquired from the Tigers with two seconds to spare before the Aug.\u00a031 deadline. A lot was made of the contract the Astros were assuming: $28\u00a0million in each of the next two seasons for a pitcher who turns 35 in February. (The Tigers are picking up $8\u00a0million per year.) But here\u2019s Houston\u2019s way of looking at it: If Verlander, who went 9\u20131 with a 1.66 ERA for Houston in the regular season and playoffs, were a free agent this winter, they couldn\u2019t possibly sign him, nor anyone like him, for just two seasons. Even accounting for the three talented prospects the Astros had to give up, it was a good deal.\n\nAfter Game 7, Luhnow and Verlander\u2014who was then just three days from marrying the supermodel Kate Upton in Italy\u2014walked together off the field and into a clubhouse that had the air quality not of Tuscany in autumn but of a Beijing bar in July, not content to celebrate just one title. \u201cTwo more to go,\u201d the GM told his still new ace.\n\nAnd then: the bullpen. Something\u2019s got to be done about the bullpen. A weakness during the season\u2014the relievers\u2019 ERA of 4.27 ERA ranked 17th in baseball\u2014it was an outright liability during the playoffs, when its ERA spiked to 5.40. Still, Ken Giles almost certainly won\u2019t continue to be the Ken Giles of October, during which he yielded 10 runs in 72\u20443 innings and coughed up his closer\u2019s role. Collin McHugh and Brad Peacock could relinquish their spots in the rotation and excel in the pen. Joe Musgrove, awful during the playoffs (8.10 ERA) but a shutdown reliever during the second half (1.44), should continue to develop; he\u2019s only 24. The Astros could certainly use a lefty, maybe two, to replace Francisco Liriano and Tony Sipp. The Rockies\u2019 Jake McGee, the Royals\u2019 Mike Minor and Tony Watson\u2014who watched Game 7 from L.A.\u2019s bullpen\u2014are the cream of the free-agent crop; their representatives ought to answer calls from a Houston area code on the first ring this winter.\n\nThe Astros have something else, too, and that\u2019s the approach they promoted when they had nothing else going for them: their Process. Call it Astroball. Yes, it relies heavily on metrics and probabilistic modeling, but it was never as soulless as its critics\u2014and there were many\u2014believed.\n\n\nThe front office's stroke of genius was that it realized that hard data meant a lot, and it concocted all sorts of new ways to harness it. But a reliance on data as an answer, as opposed to a tool, has led all kinds of organizations astray in recent years. What the Astros\u2019 scouts saw and processed mattered just as much as spin rates and launch angles. That\u2019s why Houston ended up with players like Bregman and Correa, who are never afraid, despite their youth. When the team chose Correa No. 1 in 2012\u2014such a shock that their own public relations staff didn\u2019t have a bio prepared for him\u2014it was because scouting staff like Mike Elias pushed for him. Giving Beltr\u00e1n $16 million dollars not just for his bat, but also for the mathematically unquantifiable ways his leadership and experience would seep into the clubhouse, was another such move.\n\nYOUR 2018 CHAMPS: Why the Astros Will Repeat Next Season as World Series Champions\n\nLuhnow, now assistant GM Elias, special assistants Kevin ...

You can find new stories here.\nScenes from the Olympics.\nFeb. 20 2014 8:29 PM\n\nThat Was ... Curious\n\nRussia\u2019s Adelina Sotnikova beat Yuna Kim to win figure skating gold. But did she really deserve to win?\n\nGold medalist Adelina Sotnikova, right, and Youna Kim pose during the flower ceremony after Thursday's free skate at the Sochi Games.\nGold medalist Adelina Sotnikova, right, and Yuna Kim pose during the flower ceremony after Thursday's free skate at the Sochi Games.\n\nPhoto by Adrian Dennis\/AFP\/Getty Images\n\nFor all that it did to destabilize the world, the Cold War really heightened the comedy potential of subjectively evaluated Olympic sports. Take, for example, the old 6.0 scoring system for figure skating. If you saw, say, East German skater Katarina Witt receive a ludicrously low 5.5 score for technical merit from the American judge and 5.7s and 5.8s from the rest of the panel, at least you knew exactly what was going on.\n\nJessica Winter Jessica Winter\n\nJessica Winter is Slate\u2019s features editor and the author of the novel Break in Case of Emergency.\n\nBut now, after watching the women\u2019s free skate in Sochi, I confess that I have no idea what is going on. Specifically, it\u2019s hard to know how to feel about Russian Adelina Sotnikova\u2019s upset victory over reigning Olympic champion Yuna Kim of South Korea. We do know that Sotnikova\u2019s fellow Russian, the battle-scarred sentimental favorite Evgeni Plushenko, also received strikingly generous scores on his way to winning the team gold. We know that the judges\u2019 panel for the women\u2019s free skate did not include a Korean judge (or an American one) but did include four from Eastern Europe: Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, and Slovakia. We know that the Russian judge, Alla Shekhovtseva, is married to the general director and past president of the Figure Skating Federation of Russia, which the International Skating Union (ISU) somehow does not view as a conflict of interest. And we know that the judge from Ukraine, Yury Balkov, received a yearlong suspension from the ISU after the 1998 Nagano games, when a Canadian judge recorded Balkov proposing a vote-trading deal. Balkov was back in action in time to serve as a judge during the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, site of the judging scandal that helped lead to a total revamp of the scoring system for figure skating.\n\nOnly in figure skating would a judging system be revamped to make it more opaque. That opacity is the reason why we may never know who was Team Kim, who was Team Sotnikova, and whether or not those allegiances broke down along country lines in Sochi.\n\n\nIn contrast to the relatively crude 6.0 system, the post-2005 model is designed for maximum empiricism and incorruptibility. Each technical element\u2014jumps, spins, footwork\u2014is assigned a base value; in turn, a panel of judges assigns each a grade of execution while also evaluating the skater in areas such as choreography, interpretation, and timing. (Former skater Chloe Katz recently wrote an excellent explainer-cum-critique of the system.)\n\nThe supposed empiricism here is undermined by the fact that the scores are anonymous. This anonymity ostensibly takes the pressure off judges to vote in a nationalistic spirit, but it also erases any notion of public accountability. What\u2019s more, two of the nine overall scores are discarded at random, and of the seven remaining, the high and low are also tossed out. Again, this sorting mechanism is double-edged: It may dilute the odds of bloc voting, but it also intensifies the odds of a skater being randomly boosted or penalized by the luck of the draw.\n\nSotnikova\u2019s victory over Kim has stirred Christine Brennan of USA Today and others to suggest strongly that a fix is in. American skater Ashley Wagner, whose displeasure with her scores during the team event became Sochi\u2019s first Internet meme, said she felt cheated by the judging system. \"People don't want to watch a sport where you see people fall down and somehow score above someone who goes clean,\u201d said Wagner, referring pointedly to her being judged more harshly than fellow American Gracie Gold and Russia\u2019s Yulia Lipnitskaya, both of whom fell during the free skate. \u201cPeople need to be held accountable. They need to get rid of the anonymous judging.\u201d\n\nBut if Olympic watchers have a thirst for a good scandal, this competition isn\u2019t juicy enough to slake it. Kim\u2019s skate was clean and elegant, but also a bit wooden and cautious. Sotnikova\u2019s relationship to her music seemed at times incidental, a couple of her jumps were messy in the air, and she stepped out of one landing, but Kim had one fewer triple jump and received lower marks on both her jumps and her layback, just as Dick Button predicted. Kim turned inward and Sotnikova reached outward, beckoning and waving to the crowd and working her home-field advantage. Kim had an excess of poise and maturity, and Sotnikova had an excess of energy. Kim left the ice looking like she\u2019d completed an assignment and Sotnikova left as if the bodies of her competitors were strewn all over it, a tableau of bloodstained tulle and broken feathers.\n\nWhen the marks were toted up\u2014at least, the ones that weren\u2019t thrown out randomly\u2014Sotnikova outscored Kim on execution and trailed on components (performance, interpretation, and the like). If the competition really were rigged, it seems as though the judges would have graded Sotnikova more enthusiastically on the subjective stuff. Or maybe they were just super-subtle about it: The Associated Press recap suggested that Kim\u2019s component marks should have been radically higher than Sotnikova\u2019s, instead of just slightly so. Still, Kim, who announced her retirement after the competition, delivered a notably un-Wagner-like assessment of how she\u2019d ended up with silver. \u201cAt that time I could die for gold in the Olympics,\u201d she said, speaking of the Vancouver Games. \u201cBut that desire, that strong wish, was not as present. The motivation was a problem, I think.\u201d\n\nMaybe the outcome would have been different if this were 2018, when the Russian wouldn\u2019t be skating for a Russian crowd and the South Korean would be skating for a South Korean crowd at the Pyeongchang Games. And maybe the ISU could further refine and mathematize the scoring system to edit out ultra-subjective and intangible components like \u201cpoise\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201cwaving pluckily to the crowd while skating backward\u201d altogether. (Maybe they could even accede to Ashley Wagner\u2019s wishes: So long as you don\u2019t fall down, you get a medal!) But if the ISU wants to be that literal-minded, it might as well bring back compulsories. Just like Wagner, all I want is a little public accountability, like in the days when an American judge would dock a skater two-tenths of a point just for landing on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. Back then, at least we knew where we stood.",

For those players, the ultimate dream is a shot at one day becoming a Hall of Famer. This past July, one special father found himself with that title without ever having played in a single game.\n\nDawaun Smith of Jacksonville, Florida, never dreamed he\u2019d make the trip to Canton, Ohio, for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Week powered by Johnson Controls, but he did \u2014 and it all started with a simple letter.\n\nThe rock of his family\n\nSmith faces challenges every day that might break other men. He is a father of three, and spends his days and nights caring for his wife, their 4-year-old twins and 9-year-old son Liam, who has Down Syndrome and has battled Leukemia, requiring constant medical attention.\n\nSmith has spent the past several years traveling back and forth to the hospital for his son\u2019s lifesaving treatments while his wife Shenera stayed home with the twins. Even during the hardest times, Smith does his best to find ways to make Liam laugh during tough appointments, while also keeping the rest of his family\u2019s spirits up.\n\nRecognized for his commitment\n\nSmith\u2019s commitment to his family remained steadfast, and while he saw nothing exceptional in what he was doing, Shenera most certainly did. She captured Smith\u2019s courage, strength and care in a heartfelt letter entering Smith in the Haggar Hall of Fame Dads(TM) contest.\n\n\u201cHe is the BEST dad because he is the rock of our family,\u201d Shenera wrote, speaking for her 9-year-old son. \u201cHe donned his cape and made sure I was safe, comforted and happy as possible at the hospital during all of those crummy procedures \u2026\u201d\n\nHaggar Clothing Co., the official jacket provider of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, wanted to create a new Hall of Fame to recognize and celebrate America\u2019s greatest dads and father figures.\n\nThe contest received more than 6,000 nominations and 50 dads were recognized as individual state winners. However, only one father could be chosen as the national winner, and Smith could barely contain his excitement when he learned that the honor belonged to him.\n\n\u201cWinning the Haggar Hall of Fame Dads contest has been the experience of a lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cI am honored to receive the award on behalf of dads everywhere.\u201d\n\nCelebrating with the greats\n\nIn recognition of his award, Smith was able to choose between attending the Pro Football or Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Enshrinement Ceremony. He also received a special edition Haggar Hall of Fame Dad jacket and a complete Haggar wardrobe.\n\nA lifelong football fan, Smith chose the NFL route and embarked on a VIP weekend that started with tickets to the Hall of Fame Game between the Chicago Bears and Baltimore Ravens. The following day, he took a tour of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and attended the Gold Jacket Dinner, where he saw the Class of 2018 Enshrinees receive their coveted Haggar Gold Jackets.\n\nThe big event, however, was the Enshrinement Ceremony where Smith attended the VIP reception and watched as the newest members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame were enshrined. \u201cMy favorite part was probably the Enshrinement Ceremony, listening to all of the speeches,\u201d he said. \u201cRay Lewis is one of my favorite players and getting to see him and hear his speech was unforgettable.\u201d\n\nHome again\n\nSmith\u2019s Pro Football Hall of Fame experience may have come to an end, but he\u2019s happy to be back with his loved ones and will continue to meet the challenges of his life with humor and compassion. He\u2019s a Haggar Hall of Fame Dad, and that\u2019s good enough for him.\n\n\u201cI get emotional just thinking about it. I went with my dad and seeing the excitement he had and being able to experience everything with him, it\u2019s something I\u2019ll remember forever.\u201d\n\nPaid Post",

        "text":"\u00a9 2014 MLB Advanced Media, L.P. All rights reserved.\n\n5\/20\/2014 12:27 P.M. ET\n\nHard work puts Halos on the upswing\n\nDisappointing campaigns appear to be in rearview for potential contenders\n\nHere's to the Angels. A tip of the hat to you, fellas. They're back. At least they appear to be, and if you look at them from a certain angle, you can see that their 24-20 record is possibly the start of something more.\n\nIf 24-20 doesn't blow your socks off, pay closer attention. The Angels were 17-27 at this point last season and 19-25 two years ago. Both those seasons began with high expectations and a sense of optimism. But the Halos fell so far behind so quickly that their seasons were over almost before they began.\n\nIt's not just that the Angels are 24-20. It's how they got there. Albert Pujols is healthy again and hitting with confidence and power (12 home runs). Mike Trout is doing his usual thing, with 10 doubles, four triples and eight home runs. His strikeouts are up, but this is part of the adjustment period every young player experiences as scouting reports get around.\n\nThe Angels are third in the American League in runs despite Josh Hamilton having played just eight games. Once he returns from the disabled list, the Halos finally could have that Pujols-Trout-Hamilton combination performing at a high level.\n\nThey've also gotten solid starting pitching, especially from the front three of Jered Weaver, C.J. Wilson and Garrett Richards. The Angels are 15-9 in their 24 starts. Tyler Skaggs has shown flashes of being exactly what the Halos hoped he would be.\n\nAnd then there's 27-year-old right-hander Matt Shoemaker. He was summoned from the Minor Leagues when Hector Santiago was sent to the bullpen, and in two starts, he has beaten Cliff Lee and David Price. Shoemaker was signed as an undrafted free agent out of Eastern Michigan six years ago to fill out a roster at a low Minor League level.\n\nShoemaker has spent seven seasons in the Minors, including all or parts of the last five at Triple-A, and he is a reminder that the most difficult thing to measure in sports is heart and determination. He simply was going to figure things out.\n\nShoemaker is also a reminder that movement and location are as important as velocity. He's throwing strikes, challenging hitters and keeping them off balance. Shoemaker has also polished a nice curveball to mix into a catalogue that already had a fastball, slider and split-finger. Because he's throwing all four pitches at different speeds and because he's throwing strikes, he has a chance to get comfortable in the big leagues.\n\nThe Angels have gotten nice work from utility players Grant Green and C.J. Cron as well as 23-year-old right-hander Mike Morin, among others. In other words, their organizational depth has been tested in these first weeks and has passed with flying colors.\n\nAs general manager Jerry Dipoto has sorted through his bullpen options, that group has performed better, but it will be a work in progress for awhile. Meanwhile, the Halos keep winning. They've won eight of 11 to keep the A's in sight in the AL West, and they have come from behind 13 times, including five times in the last 11 days.\n\nThose are the victories that build confidence and resilience, that send a message that this is a club made of the right stuff. Maybe a couple of bitterly disappointing seasons will make this little ride that much more special. Sometimes, things work out exactly the way they were drawn up. Sometimes, though, they don't.\n\nEven if a GM has done a dozen things right, things can still come undone. There's always a human element. There's also an unknown element about good teams, a chemistry or a leadership factory or something.\n\nThis 24-20 start is a refreshing change. In Arte Moreno, the Angels have an owner who has given his baseball people the resources to sign big-ticket free agents and to put a first-class product on the field.\n\nAnd in Dipoto, the Angels have a widely-respected GM, one who has continued to focus on the big picture, to build a great organization from top to bottom. As important as Hamilton and Pujols have been to the Halos, they simply can't win without getting contributions from products of the system like Green, Cron, Shoemaker and Morin.\n\nFinally, there's Mike Scioscia. In his 16th season on the job, he remains as smart and organized and competitive as any manager. There's no way to have a conversation about the best managers in the game without including Scioscia. Four seasons out of the playoffs have eaten at him and driven him to get it right.\n\nSo Dipoto and Scioscia have been rewarded in these first weeks with a club that reflects plenty of their own competitive fire and resolve. The Angels are third in the AL in home runs, but they're first in triples and third in stolen bases.\n\nThose numbers tell you this is an aggressive club, a club that has a couple of different ways to win games. So far, it's working. Here's to good, smart work rewarded.\n\nRichard Justice is a columnist for MLB.com. Read his blog, Justice4U.

        "text":"\u2022 No products in the cart.\n\nChina embraces sports boom in its middle class\n\nsports boom\n\n\"Running is the new religion of the Chinese middle class.\" That's the view of Catherine Sun, intellectual property lawyer, mother of five and devotee of the notion that China has finally moved beyond the days when its national sport was, well, shopping.\n\n\n\"For 30 years people have really been motivated by greed and money, they haven't looked at how to live a more meaningful life,\" says Ms Sun, the first female Chinese runner to complete seven marathons on seven continents. \"But in the past three to four years, running has become a religion for the Chinese middle class. Once you are economically independent, you think more spiritually, and in China there's not much religion.\" Pounding the pavements, she concludes, \"has allowed the middle class to find something meaningful in their empty lives\".\n\n\nScarcely a decade ago, Chinese marathon organisers struggled to fill their starting blocks. Now, in the big cities, runners have to win a lottery to enter: 100,000 people applied for full or half marathons in Shanghai last year but only 23,000 were allowed to run. But Ms Sun wants to proselytise further afield: she aims to organise 100 marathons in small and medium-sized cities. Her goal is to get 1m mainlanders moving.\n\n\nYet decades of enforced workouts have not killed off enthusiasm for public exercise. Running has become the choice of \"sports enthusiasts\", according to a survey by Nielsen, with about 70 per cent saying they prefer it even to badminton, the old staple in mainland cities. Eighty per cent of those asked had bought sports shoes in the past year and 30 per cent took out a gym membership. Sixty per cent had downloaded a fitness app to their smartphones.\n\n\nSo that's how Ms Sun and 800 \u2014 a combination of her friends, colleagues and former classmates, and their friends, colleagues and former classmates \u2014 ended up running a 50km relay race on Mao Zedong's 122nd birthday, December 26, in the city of Changsha \u2014 the capital of Hunan province, central China, where the chairman was born.\n\n\n\n\"The sports boom is just beginning in China,\" says Lynne Zhang of Nielsen in China. She says seven to eight times as many runners compete in US marathons as in Chinese races, though there are about 1bn more people in China than in America.\u00a0\n\n\"\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u70ed\u6f6e\u624d\u521a\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\"\u5c3c\u5c14\u68ee\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684Lynne Zhang\u79f0\u3002\u5979\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7ade\u8dd1\u9a6c\u62c9\u677e\u7684\u4eba\u6570\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u4e03\u516b\u500d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e2d\u56fd\u6bd4\u7f8e\u56fd\u591a\u51fa\u7ea610\u4ebf\u4eba\u53e3\u3002\n\nBut China also has far more smog, which could hamper the mainland's devotion to running. At Mao's birthday marathon in Changsha, for example, air pollution was so bad that Ms Sun's sons, aged 15 and 17, dropped out of the race with pollution-induced illnesses.\u3000\u3000\n\n\nNevertheless, even on the murkiest days, China's public spaces are filled with people engaged in some form of exercise. Middle-aged and elderly women have taken in recent years to public dancing in ever larger numbers \u2014 and with ever louder boom boxes blasting out dance tunes from early morning to late at night, to the consternation of residents who regularly complain about loss of sleep. Sales of dance-related products on Taobao, the online marketplace, are rising rapidly among consumers in their fifties and sixties.\n\n\nBut there is one form of athletic activity that appears to be on the wane: procreation. The problem is so serious that it's drawing the attention of local authorities across the country. The government of Shanghai announced in December that it is offering extra holiday to female workers who have two babies or even one \u2014 part of an official drive to boost the birth rate and counter a demographic crisis arising from an ageing population.\u3000\n\n\nI'll put my money on the marathon runners any day. The growth rate in China's population of runners will easily outpace the rise in population overall, probably for many years to come.\u3000\u3000\n\n\nShort nappies and go long on fitness apps. That's a creed with truly Chinese characteristics.\u3000\n\n\n\n0 responses on \"China embraces sports boom in its middle class\"\n\n    Leave a Message\n\n    Your email address will not be published.

        "text":"The Golf Life | Mr. XMarch 30, 2016\n\nUndercover Tour Pro: Even the players run afoul of Augusta National\n\nTwo guards hold my dad in a small room, cellphone jail, and I have to go get him.\n\nI\u2019ve played in three Masters. I\u2019m comfortable there, but the first time I was definitely on edge. Augusta National is a beautiful place, but, boy, there are some different rules. And you really don\u2019t want to get caught breaking one. If you can keep your name out of the conversation until Sunday, then go out with a bang of birdies and somehow wind up with a green jacket, well, that\u2019s a good way to do it.\n\nNot that I spend that much time considering my decorum. We\u2019re all professionals. We play golf for a living and know how to conduct ourselves in and around a clubhouse. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re out drinking and smoking all year and then clean it up for a week. Still, there are ways we mess up.\n\nMy first Masters, I went a couple weeks early to see the course. My regular caddie was allowed to walk along as a local caddie took us around. After, we played the Par-3 Course. It was near dusk, and at one of the far tees I said to my caddie, my longtime friend and fellow golf lunatic, \u201cHere, hit one.\u201d\n\nThe local caddie took the wedge from my hand: \u201cIf he hits that ball, I lose my job.\u201d Whoa, I thought, that\u2019s excessive. But I believed him.\n\nObviously, the big thing is the phone. You use it only in the locker room. Every week on the PGA Tour, I conduct full-length phone conversations on the range, so that\u2019s different. Even if you\u2019re waiting on a tee during a practice round, don\u2019t sneak the phone out for a quick text. I\u2019ve seen guys do this, but it\u2019s not worth the potential aggravation.\n\nMy coach was once thrown out when he took video of my swing with his BlackBerry. We were at the seventh tee box. A security guard removed him from the golf course. He spent the rest of the day checking out the town.\n\nWhen my parents came, we had trouble. They flew in when I was playing a practice round, and so my wife and daughter go to pick them up. Because they had the courtesy car, they could drive right down Magnolia Lane, which was a thrill for my folks. As soon as they park, my dad goes straight to the merchandise center. He wanted to be sure he got the best stuff before it sold out.\n\nHe gets $400 worth of souvenirs. As he\u2019s going through checkout, his card gets declined because he\u2019s traveling out of state. He steps away from the register and takes out his phone\u2014going through the player entrance, he hadn\u2019t faced security\u2014and begins dialing the number on the back of the card. Before he can press \u201csend,\u201d two guards grab him by the shoulders and usher him out. They don\u2019t even tell him to put the phone away. They hold him in this small room, cellphone jail, and I have to go get him.\n\nMy dad\u2019s shaken up and feels terrible. When his captors see I\u2019m a player, there\u2019s no sense of sorry for any misunderstanding. It wasn\u2019t like my dad was out on the course taking photos or calling in to a radio show. The vibe was definitely the other way: We should feel bad, and I could expect to hear more about this incident. (I didn\u2019t.) The whole thing took about an hour.\n\nBecause our child is in daycare, the club always gives my wife a beeper. She has never had a problem. Another system that works great is the little card they give players. It\u2019s like your member card. You can eat anywhere, and whatever your family spends, they just send you a bill a few weeks later. It\u2019s fantastic. All in, just about every minute you spend at Augusta National is a life highlight. But you will have a few \u201clearning\u201d experiences.\n\nTons of players have stories just like mine, I\u2019m sure. Nobody talks about them because life\u2019s easier when those stories don\u2019t get out. \u2014with Max Adler",

        "text":"The Kansas City Chiefs last played in the Super Bowl 50 years ago, famously defeating the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 in New Orleans at Tulane Stadium, which no longer exists.\n\nWhat follows are three unconnected Mississippi stories you hopefully will find interesting from that fourth Super Bowl:\n\n\u2022 Jacksonian Noland Smith, famously nicknamed \u201cSuper Gnat\u201d and one of the most exciting kick returners in the history of the sport, has a Super Bowl championship ring from that game, even though he was no longer a Kansas City Chief when it was played.\n\n\u2022 Madison resident Jim Walker is the proud owner of two perfectly preserved 45-yard-line tickets from that game. The tickets were never used.\n\nRick Cleveland\n\n\u2022 Super Bowl IV was the only Super Bowl my late mother, Carrie Cleveland, ever attended. But I am not certain she actually watched a single play.\n\nAnd so we begin with Super Gnat. You look at Noland Smith and you wonder how in the world this man could have played professional football. He stands 5-feet-6 inches short. He weighs only a few pounds over his playing weight of 154 pounds. He is now 76 years old, retired after putting in 44 years working for the city of Jackson\u2019s recreation department.\n\nNoland Smith: A little guy who could fly.\n\nSmith was one of the tiniest players in pro football history. \u201cIt has been written that I was the smallest to have played,\u201d he said over a cup of coffee earlier this week. \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure.\u201d\n\nAgain, it is hard to imagine one smaller. But Smith was a pocket rocket. He could fly. His high school (Brinkley) and college (Tennessee State) nickname was \u201cJet.\u201d He once ran a 9.4 100-yard dash. He could change directions quicker than you can bat an eye.\n\nLamar Hunt, the Chiefs\u2019 owner, gave him the nickname that stuck. \u201cHe looks like a gnat out there among all those giants,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cLet\u2019s call him Super Gnat.\u201d\n\nIn those pre-integration days, Smith had signed with Jackson State after his senior season at Brinkley. But then Jackson State coach John Merritt hired on at Tennessee State and Smith followed. He was a sensation at Tennessee State, where, by chance, legendary Kansas City Chiefs coach Hank Stram happened to see him play in a spring intra-squad game. Stram had gone to look at three other Tennessee State players. He came away much more impressed by Smith. At Stram\u2019s insistence, the Chiefs drafted him in the sixth round of the 1967 draft.\n\nSmith was an instant hit. In his first preseason game, the first time he touched the ball, he returned a punt 86 yards for a touchdown. He wore jersey number 46 in that game, the same number he had worn at Tennessee State.\n\nWhen he went to his locker for the next game, he found jersey No. 1.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked the equipment man.\n\n\u201cMr. Hunt wants you to wear No. 1,\u201d the guy replied.\n\nSmith took that as a good sign. Of course the KC publicity guy had a different spin. He told reporters that No. 1 was the only number that would fit on Smith\u2019s jersey.\n\nWhatever, Smith led the league in kickoff return yards and average as a rookie, returning one kickoff a record 106 yards for a touchdown. He was also a terror on punt returns and also played as a backup wide receiver. He continued to dazzle in 1968, averaging a league-leading 15 yards per punt return and returning one 80 yards for a score, while also continuing as a kickoff return ace.\n\nTwo factors derailed Smith in 1969, Kansas City\u2019s Super Bowl Championship season. One, the NFL then had a 40-man roster limit (as opposed to 53 now), which left little room for return specialists. Two, he suffered a dangerous injury in a game against Cincinnati when he was \u201cclothes-lined\u201d by an opponent on a punt return, breaking facial bones and causing him to have triple vision in his left eye.\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to catch a punt when men nearly twice your size are barreling down the field aiming to maim you. But try doing it when you look up and see three footballs.\n\nNot long afterward, the Chiefs traded Smith to the San Francisco 49ers at mid-season. Thus, he wasn\u2019t there for the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl run.\n\nRick Cleveland\n\nNoland Smith displays his Super Bowl ring. Credit: Rick Cleveland\n\nWhen the Chiefs did make the Super Bowl, Smith could have gone to the game. He was back in Kansas City by then, working at his off-season job at a beer distributorship. But the owner of the company was putting on a big Super Bowl party and asked Smith to come schmooze with his guests. And he did that.\n\nYes, Smith says, he pulled for his former teammates, many of whom remain his pals to this day.\n\n\u201cWe really were like a family with the Chiefs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did everything together, not just football. When I got to the 49ers it was so different. You didn\u2019t see each other except at practice. The Chiefs were family.\u201d\n\nRick Clevleand\n\nThis is the box that holds Smith\u2019s Super Bowl ring, tie clip, cuff links and necklace. Credit: Rick Clevleand\n\nAnd the Chiefs rewarded their Super Gnat for his role in the championship season. He received not only his Super Bowl ring, but Super Bowl cuff links, a tie clasp and necklace, all replete with diamonds. He also received half a winner\u2019s share for the KC victory, which amounted to $7,500.\n\nThat was a lot of money for someone who was making the league minimum salary ($12,000 at the time).\n\nThat turned out to be Smith\u2019s last season in football. He still ranks 16th on the NFL\u2019s all-time list for kick return average (26.6 yards per return). He still goes to the Chiefs\u2019 alumni reunion every year and stays in close touch with many of his teammates including Jan Stenerud, Mike Garrett and Otis Taylor.\n\n\u201cNo regrets,\u201d he says. \u201cI loved every minute of it. I loved the challenge of returning punts and kickoffs. Yeah, it was dangerous, but I loved the challenge.\u201d\n\nMadison\u2019s Jim Walker grew up in Gulfport, 700 feet from the beach. In 1969, when he was an eighth-grader, his mother worked for Gulfport mayor Billy Meadows, who came into possession of two Super Bowl tickets. Meadows gave the tickets to Walker\u2019s mother. These were prime tickets, at about the 45-yard-line. Yet, face value was only $15. Tickets to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl are scaled from $1,000 to $5,000 and many folks are paying much higher scalper rates.\n\nWalker says his parents, both football fans, had planned to attend. Walker was jealous. He was a big fan of Kansas City quarterback Len Dawson. But something came up. Walker doesn\u2019t remember exactly what, but his parents could not go. Walker was too young to drive himself. The tickets went unused and Walker forgot about them.\n\nFast forward 35 years to 2005 and Hurricane Katrina, the beast that destroyed so much of the Gulf Coast, including the Walkers\u2019 47-year-old home. His parents, since deceased, drove to Madison as the storm neared. In the aftermath, Jim Walker drove to Gulfport to assess the damage.\n\nJim Walker of Madison, with the 1970 Super Bowl tickets he found in the remains of his parents\u2019 Gulfport home, destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe home was a total loss. As Walker rummaged through the remains, he found a box that hadn\u2019t been flooded. He opened the box and found an envelope. He opened the envelope and found the 35-year-old Super Bowl tickets in mint condition. He also found a framed certificate decreeing Jayne Mansfield, famous actress and entertainer, an honorary citizen of Gulfport. Mansfield had been performing regularly on the Coast before she was killed in a tragic automobile accident. The Gulfport mayor never had a chance to make the presentation.\n\nNow then, fast forward to 2017 when Jim Walker decided to see what those tickets might be worth. He sent them to a California company that grades and preserves such historic items and was instantly offered $4,000 for the pair. He didn\u2019t sell.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve still got \u2019em.\u201d\n\nHe does know what team he will pull for Sunday. \u201cThe Chiefs, of course,\u201d Walker said. A Len Dawson fan 50 years ago, he likes Patrick Mahomes these days.\n\nI have first-hand knowledge of this next episode. My mother, Carrie Cleveland, was a huge football fan. She cared nothing for the X\u2019s and O\u2019s of the game, but she loved the pageantry of the sport. She loved the games. So when my father scored three tickets to the fourth Super Bowl, off we went. These were superb tickets, 45-yard line, fairly high up in Tulane Stadium, a great view.\n\nWe got there early on a gray, damp overcast day as I remember. My mother, my brother Bobby and I sat in the appointed seats. My dad went to the press box. We were all pulling for the Chiefs. Jerrell Wilson, the Chiefs punter had played at Southern Miss and was a friend of the family. Dad probably got those tickets from Wilson.\n\nWe were watching the pre-game ceremonies shortly before kickoff when Mama suddenly sat upright and seemed to try to catch her breath. Clearly, she was excited about something. She craned her neck, kept staring down at something.\n\nThis went on for a few seconds. Finally, I asked, \u201cMama, what is it?\u201d\n\nShe still couldn\u2019t talk.
