        "text":"Boss Fight Studio Vitruvian HACKS \u2013 Penthesilea\n\nOrder Penthesilea on Boss Fight Shop!\n\npenthesilea-01 penthesilea-02\n\nAnother well established character in Greek mythology, Penthesilea was the queen of Amazons and the one-time wife of Achilles himself, a voracious warrior and a tragic character within the intricate mythology. \u00a0Her inclusion in the Vitruvian HACKS line is a welcome one, I love reading the history of some of these characters, especially ones who aren\u2019t quite as well known.\n\n\nWith Achilles confirmed for release in Wave 6, it\u2019s cool to see Penthesilea here (even if I need to check the spelling of her name every time) as a nice connection point between Achilles and bringing the Amazons into the story as well. \u00a0As usual, Boss Fight Studio does fantastic work walking that line between the established Greek myths and putting their own unique twist on these characters.\n\nPenthesilea is written here as the Amazon Commander and the daughter of Ares, the God of War. \u00a0The story in her file card actually talks about Achilles\u2019 betrayal of her and that she ended up leading an army of Amazons against him after he spurned her and joined the Gorgon Horde. As Achilles equal in battle, Penthesilea immediately gets some real credibility as leader of the Amazons.\n\n\nAs one might imagine, the base figure is the same as the Amazon and Elite Amazon, and that\u2019s really fine with me, as the general female figure buck is one of my favorite aspects of the Vitruvian HACKS line. \u00a0Her head is the long-haired female head that\u2019s included with all of the Blanks, and I love the streak of white contrasting against the black.\n\n\n\nUnlike both the Amazon and Elite Amazon, Penthesilea doesn\u2019t have any tattoos, and while the gold armor matches the standard Amazon warrior, her layered blue leather skirt is a really great color. \u00a0I love the shade of blue, it really differentiates her from her foot soldiers, yet still ends up looking like a realistic leather dyed material and not a completely unrealistic color.\n\nHer articulation is terrific, with awesome rocker ankles, full range of motion throughout the limbs, and it compliments the slim sculpting perfectly as most of the female figures do. \u00a0She is one great looking figure and a nearly perfect addition to the already fantastic Amazon cadre of warriors. \u00a0With her different head sculpt, long hair, and streak of white she looks like an awesome elder stateswoman of the Amazons, the brave commander leading the attack against her former flame Achilles.\n\n\n\nI certainly was never an expert in Greek mythology, but felt like I knew enough, but I had never heard the legend of Penthesilea. \u00a0Now that I know it, I\u2019m thrilled that she got her own action figure, and greatly look forward to the release of Achilles. \u00a0It certainly helps that this figure has a great updated paint scheme and a head sculpt to differentiate her from her warriors.\n\n\n\n\nPenthesilea comes with a nice assortment of accessories. \u00a0She has three swords, including the long sword, which is one that I really love. \u00a0The sheath in the back of her skirt holds one of the swords, and she can sport the other two as she battles through the Gorgon Horde. \u00a0Along with the swords she has her shield, decoed in a fantastic new paint pattern of what looks to be a winged horse attacking another horse. \u00a0I\u2019m not sure what the cultural significance of the image is, but it looks awesome.\n\n\nPenthesilia is a great figure. \u00a0The blue leather skirt, first use of the long hair blank head sculpt, and her awesome new shield all add some real great elements to an already impressive line up of Amazons. \u00a0She fits the bill of Amazon Commander to perfection and is a really great figure to boot. \u00a0Awesome addition to the mythology.\n\n  \u2022 Character\n  \u2022 Sculpt\n  \u2022 Articulation\n  \u2022 Paint Deco\n  \u2022 Accessories\n\n\nWith the nearly flawless female figure buck, excellent head sculpt and great updated color scheme, Penthesilea only serves to add more greatness to the already spectacular Amazon figures. As the Amazon Commander, she leads the pack, and while she compliments the other Amazons well, she also has her own distinct look.",

        "text":"7 Challenge, Everyday Life\n\nWaste Not: Part 5 of the 7 Challenge\n\n7: An Experimental Mutiny Against ExcessLast month I was supposed to be working on the Waste part of the 7 challenge. When I began thinking about this part of the challenge, I thought I was already doing pretty well on that front. I have a family of four and we fill up our recycling cart at the same rate if not faster than our trash cart. Usually, our trash cart is only half full on the day the trash is picked up. I am guilty of looking at neighbors\u2019 trash cans on trash pick up day and thinking, \u201cWow. They are Wasters.\u201d Needless to say, there was a high horse to fall off there.\n\nAnd fall off I did. Because, while I do recycle absolutely everything I possibly can, the point remains that if I have something to recycle, that means I\u2019m buying something that\u2019s prepackaged. Deli meats, canned spaghetti sauce, boxes of noodles, yogurt cups, all that stuff comes in recyclable packages. And some things I consider to be necessary are packaged and aren\u2019t recyclable. I mean, when I think about all the Styrofoam egg cartons\u2026but how do you get around that? Aldi only sells one kind of egg!\n\nI guess it all comes down to how much trouble I\u2019m willing to go to in my attempts to reduce waste. I think I kind of phoned it in on this part of the challenge. And that is unacceptable. So I\u2019m doing a re-do in March. Here are the more specific goals for the month:\n\n-Start (and, please Lord, finish!) potty training Isaac in the second half of the month. He\u2019ll be 3 in June and with another baby due in July, now seems like it\u2019s time. My \u201cmethod\u201d relies heavily on not wearing a whole lot of clothing for the first few days of potty training, which is why I think this should take place in the warmer part of \u00a0the month. I greet this part of the challenge with a great deal of trepidation\u2013potty training my firstborn took about a year, and I am not exaggerating.\n\n-At least\u00a0try\u00a0to get Ella out of nighttime Pull-ups. I\u2019ve heard some parents have success with waking young children up and taking them to the bathroom before the parents go to bed. I\u2019m just not sure about this one. One problem is I go to bed about an hour to an hour and a half after my children. Is that enough time? Another problem is I abhor the drama that always follows when my poor little four-year-old is incoherently sleepy. To willingly bring that upon both of us is going to take some girding up of mental toughness. If anyone else has experience with methods for getting rid of Pull-ups at night, please share. I\u2019d really prefer not waking her up because I think she barely gets enough sleep as it is.\n\n-Sew a couple of handkerchiefs for myself. Yes, I just used the word \u201chandkerchief.\u201d And the word \u201csew.\u201d I hate, hate,\u00a0hate\u00a0buying Kleenexes. Which is why my husband is always asking in a very nice but what I hear as accusing tone, \u201cDon\u2019t we have any Kleenex?\u201d I just don\u2019t think to buy them, and when I do remember, I say, \u201cWe don\u2019t really need those.\u201d But my husband and my kids really enjoy a soft nose wipe for the winter months. And the allergy ridden spring months. And probably all the months in between. I could care less, I\u2019ll use a brown paper bag, but I do grab a Kleenex if they\u2019re handy. I\u2019d rather use something that\u2019s reusable, though. So, hello, old fashioned-ness. (I have the same goal for nursing liners, but I won\u2019t go into great detail there. Details about Kleenex usage are quite enough for one day).\n\n-Reduce our dependence on boxed cereal. There are lots of reasons this is a good idea, one of them being most cereal doesn\u2019t keep my kids full past 8:00 a.m. Another reason is a lot of those colorful boxes pose major recycling problems. Another reason is it\u2019s mostly gross and we throw out half of the box. Is there a drawback? Oh yeah, cooking and washing dishes before 8:00 in the morning. Dear friends, bring on the easy breakfast ideas.\n\nThose are the goals. I could think of more, but my children are pretending to be firefighters and I probably should go put a stop to their throwing open the front door and yelling \u201cFire, fire, EMERGENCY!\u201d for the whole neighborhood to hear. Because a false 911 call is even more wasteful than a Styrofoam egg carton.\n\n\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...\n\n3 thoughts on \u201cWaste Not: Part 5 of the 7 Challenge\u201d\n\n  1. SarahJ says:\n\n    We do a lot of cereal\u2026 mostly because I buy it cheap with coupons\/sales\u2026 but one of my favorite breakfasts is to mix up my granny\u2019s Swedish bran muffin recipe one evening\u2026 the batter keeps for 2 weeks in the refrigerator so I can bake a dozen at a time\u2026 or more. I often just reheat the leftovers for the next morning. And add a banana. They are super filling and the kids love them.\n\n  2. Brittany L says:\n\n    I love doing those baked oatmeal in muffin tin \u201cmuffins\u201d, they\u2019re really good and easy to personalize. The best part is you can freeze them and take them out as needed. And good luck on the potty training!\n\n    1. MiaTheReader says:\n\n      Good idea, Brittany! I sure hope that recipe is on your Pinterest board because I\u2019m going to look for it right now.\n\nLeave a Reply to Brittany L\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Honey Cowl\n\nI\u2019ve had two skeins of Classic Shades yarn in my stash for quite some time \u2013 bought originally to make leg warmers, then I realized it didn\u2019t have enough \u2018bounce\u2019 and the results would likely be very saggy \u2013 and then the other day I ran across the Honey Cowl pattern and BOOM! I remembered about this yarn. \u00a0It is super soft and\u00a0snugly\u00a0 and the long color changes are nicely showcased in this slip stitch pattern.

        "text":"styleberry BLOG \u00bb where pretty meets practical\n\nMasthead header\n\nEverett\u2019s Dreamy Nursery\n\nI haven\u2019t yet decided if nurseries are actually for the baby. I kind of think they are mostly for the mama. She saw four walls and had a vision. A vision full of hopes and little moments, of snuggles and kisses. This is the place where her dreams come true\u2026the dream of becoming a mother.\n\nThe first time I got to plan a nursery I planned two. See, we are the rare few parents left that love having a \u201csurprise,\u201d but this means that there has to be some grace given when it comes to completing the nursery decor. Since I knew I would not have the same time to finish the space as I did with just one child, I planned this room as a gender neutral space, and left the details for after delivery. This way I could customize the room in either direction. It\u2019s definitely less masculine than it would be had I known I was having a boy, but the truth is, we\u2019re moving in less than two years. He\u2019ll be transitioning to a big boy bed at that time & most of the boy details are going to translate to the \u201cbig boy room\u201d I have in my head, full of oranges and greens and navy. But this room is about NOW. I spent every night for his first six months rocking him in the chair in this nursery, staring at the details that I adore so much. And I am so glad I invested the time in to this space. I love it. By the time he\u2019s old enough to have an opinion, he can help me create a room of his own. But right now, this is the perfect place to love on my sweet baby boy.\n\nI am not a buy a bedroom in a bag kind of gal. I want rooms that look like none other on the planet, with pieces collected along the way, often irreplaceable and unique to our home. This room was no exception. The very first piece that I found to inspire this room & the color palette here was the quilt. It set the tone for everything. I originally intended to have a bed in here, but I later changed my mind, when I figured out a way to make it work in our guest room\/office space. So orange, turquoise, lime, white, grey and pops of bright red were where I was headed. Here\u2019s my mood board (created before we knew \u201cit\u201d was a boy!):\n\nNow, some of my plans have changed (as all good designs do) and I just love how it is coming along. I am sure we\u2019ll be making little adjustments here & there, but for now, welcome to Everett\u2019s Dreamy Nursery. All resources linked throughout the post. Feel free to comment with any additional questions\u2026enjoy the eye candy!\n\n  \u2022 GIANT BUTTON: Hobby Lobby\n  \u2022 STAR KNOBS: Hobby Lobby (spray painted with rustoleum in stainless steel)\n  \u2022 QUILT HANGER: Ikea Dignetet Curtain Wire, (with four brackets total)\n\nOh, the painting. I love painting. Sometimes. [ha!] We (my dad and I) painted this room beige the first time. Then a chocolately orange when I got bored. Then (four years later) we painted it what I thought was the perfect gray\u2026.only to hate it as soon as we (and by we, I mean he) got two coats on. I looked and looked and the first gray, Wickham Gray, was just too blue. What if it was a girl? It was just not right. [sorry Dad!!] Back to the paint store we went again. Stonington Gray was the PERFECT shade. Whew!\n\nI planned out the stripes based on the top and bottom color\u2013I knew I wanted both to be turquoise. So I needed an odd number of stripes. I wanted them at least 12 in wide, so I did the math & started marking. (we had already painted the wall white.) I used a level to mark the lines in pencil on the wall first, then ran a line of Frog Tape along my mark. Don\u2019t bother with the blue tape. The green is a far superior option! After I had the tape up and rubbed it on well, but instead of doing my perfectly straight line trick like usual, I brushed a stroke of white over the tape line (in the section where the turquoise would go), sealing the tape to the wall. After it dried, I painted the Turquoise, Valspar\u2019s Sprinkle, over top. It took two coats to cover the white. It is the perfect shade of not too minty, not too blue turquoise. & trust me, I tried out a TON. Like, at least a dozen. The perfect turquoise is really hard to find.\n\n  \u2022 DRESSER: Ikea Expedit, on its side + feet (found in store) + (2) two drawer inserts + (2) one drawer inserts (found in store)\n  \u2022 ORANGE POT: Homegoods\n  \u2022 STRIPEY BIN: Anthropologie\n  \u2022 CHANGING PAD COVER: DIY (using this tutorial), fabric from Hobby Lobby\n  \u2022 LAMP: Homegoods\n  \u2022 WALL SHELF: Homegoods\n  \u2022 CHAIR: PB Kids Comfort Grand Swivel Glider (scored for a mere $200 at the outlet, un-upholstered) + DIY slipcover (oommmmgg) fabric: Premier Prints Chipper Twill Storm\n  \u2022 THROW PILLOW: Homegoods\n  \u2022 VARIEGATED KNIT POUF: Land of Nod (it usually sits in front of the rocker\u2026my feet don\u2019t touch the ground without it! It\u2019s necessary!!)\n\n& for the record, I finished sewing the slipcover for that chair exactly five hours before I birthed a baby. WHEW. :)\n\nAhhh. My favorite wall in the room! Too bad my back is usually to it. I originally intended for this to be an alphabet wall, but after I got the room together I decided it would be too much. AND there was no place for pictures in this room if I did just letters, so I decided to make this an eclectic treasury of goodies. All of the frames are either from Homegoods or Target. I\u2019ll source it all from left to right, top to bottom:\n\n  \u2022 CUSTOM WHALE PRINT: Tree Top Studio\n  \u2022 (2) STANDOUT MOUNTS: WHCC, of my work\n  \u2022 BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT: my work & design\n  \u2022 DREAM BIG: Barking Bird Art\n  \u2022 WRAPPING PAPER: World Market\n  \u2022 PRINT: WHCC, my work\n  \u2022 LINEN PINBOARD: Homegoods, I color-washed it turquoise & it\u2019s full of Instagrams. More on it here.\n  \u2022 BALLOON PRINT: Card, World Market\n  \u2022 CRYING IS FOR BABIES (letterpress): Sycamore Street Press\n  \u2022 WOOD FRAME: Hobby Lobby, \u201ce\u201d: Pottery Barn Outlet (I bought a standout print for in the frame and had that random \u201ce\u201d lying around since our girl name started with \u201ce\u201d too, and threw it up there to hold the place\u2026but it has actually become one of my very favorite things on that wall!)\n\n& finally, my DIY Night Light that casts the most beautiful glow on this room at night. Lord only knows how many hours I have spent staring at it. Good thing I love it so much. Full Night Light Canvas DIY here. The dresser (an old piece from college with at least three layers of paint underneath) is painted the same as the stripes, Valspar Sprinkle.\n\nIt makes me sad that this will be my very last nursery to decorate, but I am also very excited about the room evolutions that will take place as my babies grow up. I had so much fun doing this nursery and caroline\u2019s over the top girly nursery and I just know that I will be so sad to leave this house! Both rooms are so different and so fun in their own way. Both such lovely places to spend so much time in. BUT\u2026I am sure I will be ready to redecorate when we move! If I missed anything, let me know and I\u2019ll answer in the comments section! :)\n\nFor more inspiration & to see what design direction I\u2019m heading in next, check out my pinterest boards!\n\nRelated Posts with Thumbnails\n  \u2022 Rebecca - Gorgeous room!

        "text":"Feng Shui For Your Kitchen!\n\nkitchen decor\n\n(planete deco)\n\nIn the last two months I\u2019ve had a crash course in kitchen design\u2026 from cabinet components to plumbing, color to countertops. \u00a0I have a real reverance for kichens now, even more than ever, as I understand the many layers of intricacy in even a simple, budget-friendly design (that will still be well over 8,000!). \u00a0When your kitchen is bubbling with energy and life force you\u2019ll enjoy the benefits of kitchens- cooking, synergy in the family, wellness, propagating life, storing nutrition- on an even higher level.\n\nThis week, the kitchen feng shui tips are designed to nourish your life!\u00a0\n\nkitchen decor (via)\n\nFeng Shui For Your Kitchen by Carol M Olmstead, Feng Shui For Real Life\n\nA clean, bright, and clutter-free kitchen is a symbol of good health and prosperity in Feng Shui. The kitchen represents the heart of the house because that\u2019s where you prepare the food that nourishes and sustains life. Here are a few things you can do to create a Feng Shui kitchen in any home, no matter how large or small.\n\nbar cart herbs\n\n(emily henderson)\n\nChoose the Right Colors. Use bright, sunny, and earthy colors like yellow, terracotta, and brown to feel stable and grounded in your kitchen. Use the color red sparingly in a kitchen, because your stove, microwave, and other appliances generate enough of the Fire Element.\n\nTake Care of Your Stove. A stove is associated with wealth so it\u2019s important to keep all of your cooking surfaces clean and in good working order. Immediately fix any nonworking burners, and if you have a favorite burner, consider using a different one occasionally to symbolize that you are taking full advantage of all of your financial resources. Hang a mirror behind your stove or display a shiny teakettle to symbolically double the number of burners and double your wealth.\n\nControl Water. Water symbolizes the flow of wealth, so a leaking faucet means money \u201cgoing down the drain.\u201d Fix your leaks and you will stop the drain on your finances. If your sink and stove are located across from each other it also represents a financial drain. Place a small, nickel size mirror on the stove to reflect away the water, or place a green rug on the floor between them.\n\n\n\nDisplay Fresh Flowers and Fruit. Display fresh flowers, healthy plants, or bowls of fruit in your kitchen to represent vitality. The classic Feng Shui recommendation is a bowl of 9 oranges. Plants like lucky bamboo help clean and purify the air, so place them in the corners of a dark kitchen, between the sink and the stove, and on top of the refrigerator.\n\nLight Your Kitchen. If you don\u2019t have a lot of natural lighting, brighten up your kitchen with pendants, chandeliers, recessed lights, track lighting, or under-cabinet lighting. It\u2019s best to avoid fluorescent lighting because it represents harsh, cutting energy. You can also hang a mirror across from the window to attract more light into a small kitchen.\n\nSeparate Food and Cleaning Supplies. Avoid storing your brooms, mops, and cleaning supplies out in the open or near your food, because this represents symbolically \u201csweeping away\u201d and cleaning out your good health. It\u2019s okay to keep your trash under the sink, just be sure to use the smallest size container you can live with and empty it frequently. Never keep the cat\u2019s litter box in the kitchen.\n\nRemove Clutter and Other Negative Chi. Try to keep your kitchen as clutter free as possible so positive chi can flow through your space. That means keeping your counters free from objects like newspapers, mail, and schoolwork, and limiting the number of knick-knacks you display.

While I am saving up for that, meanwhile I will just clean and declutter. This article is extremely informative!

Maybe in USA you have others and better choices?\nThank you\n\nPrevious post:\n\nNext post:",

        "text":"Thursday, September 28, 2006\n\nKnitter's Tea Swap 2 Package Arrived\n\nToday, my package from Knitter's Tea Swap 2 arrived. My partner was Becky. She sent lots of great stuff. Wanna see?\n\nFirst the yarn. Socks That Rock Lightweight, Waterlilies and Misti Alpaca (and a scarf pattern for the Misti Alpaca).\n\nNext the tea. Earl Grey Lavender, Bombay Chai, Lavender Mint, Hibiscus Ginger Orange, and a sampler pack with Earl Grey Lavender, Tropical Green Tea, Golden Flowers Herbal Tea, Sweet Ginger Peach, and English Breakfast\n\nAnd the treats. A box of shortbread cookies and some German chocolates (I've already had to share these with my kids who helped unwrap all the goodies.)\n\nAnd the other goodies. A tea cup with infuser inside. A tea bag squeezer. A tea infuser. And a little pouch (see the pic below for the secret the pouch holds).\n\nAnd inside that little bag were these.\n\nTuesday, September 26, 2006\n\nCan't Elope Socks\n\nThe Can't Elope Socks are done! I decided since I was so close, I would finish them last night. I love how they are different, but still a pair.\n\nPattern - my usual top down with Eye of Partridge heel flap and kitchenered toes\nYarn - Lisa Souza Sock! Can't Elope colorway\nNeedles & Gauge - Size 1 DPNs, 9 st\/in\n\nMonday, September 25, 2006\n\nIn A Rut\n\nI seem to be in a blogging rut. I've been knitting and crocheting but just haven't seemed to find the energy to sit down and write a post. Plus, I've been lazy about taking pictures.\n\nI'm still working on the same 3 pair of socks. This weekend I made good progress on my second Can't Elope sock (just a few more rounds to go on the foot and then it will be time to start toe decreases). I also made some progress on my first Mystery sock. I completed the gusset and I'm working my way down the foot. I'm concerned that I'm going to run out of yarn, though. YIKES! I still need to cast on the second Black Bunny Pink Lemonade sock. I won't do that until the Can't Elope socks are done, which will hopefully happen this week.\n\nI'm also still working on the same baby afghan. I finally finished all the squares this weekend and starting sewing them together. I'll be really happy when this one is done. And I won't be making this pattern again, as there are a million ends to weave in.\n\nIn other news, I signed up for two swaps. I think I have everything I'm going to send my Chocolate Swap partner, I just need to pack it all up and send it out. Now I need to concentrate on getting items to send my Knitters Tea Swap 2 pal.\n\nI signed up for Socktoberfest over at Lolly's blog. My Soctoberfest plans include finishing my current sock projects and casting on more when they are done. I stumbled upon another KAL today, too. This one is the Lime & Violet KAL. Since I happen to have a skein of the yarn (Lisa Souza Sock! in the Lime & Violet colorway) in my stash, I signed up.\n\nI will post some pics as soon as I finish some of these projects.\n\nThursday, September 14, 2006\n\nSlowly Making Progress\n\nDespite knitting at every opportunity, I'm not making much progress on anything. I'm nearly finished with the leg of my Mystery sock (take 2).\n\nI also got started on my second Can't Elope sock, but haven't gotten that far yet.\n\nAnd I'm still working on the baby afghan. I have less than 20 squares to make and then I'll have to sew them all together. I haven't started on the second Pink Lemonade sock yet.\n\nMy oldest son is playing football this year (he's a Freshman in high school). His games are on Thursday nights, so I'm losing a whole night of knitting until mid-November. Normally, I would take my knitting along, but since my other 2 kids attend the games, I need to keep an eye on them. Tonight's game was cancelled because of rain, so I will be able to stay home, watch Survivor and knit socks. YAY!\n\nThis weekend, I am participating in a 5K walk\/run (mostly walk for me). It is held to help raise funds for a memorial scholarship fund. My company participates every year. This will be my second year doing it. Hopefully the rain will go away before then.\n\nSaturday, September 09, 2006\n\nTwo Socks = 0 Pairs\n\nI completed 2 socks this week, both different.\n\nOne is Black Bunny Fibers, Pink Lemonade, the other is Lisa Souza Sock!, Can't Elope\n\nI'll be re-starting my Mystery sock today, so no progress pics of it yet.\n\nMonday, September 04, 2006\n\nSocks in the Works\n\nI am currently working on 3 pair of socks. The oldest of the 3 are my Can't Elope socks. I am done with sock one, except for closing the toe. They've been at this point for probably a week now.\n\nThe next is my Mystery sock. I am using Spirit Trail Fiberworks yarn which I purchased at MD Sheep and Wool this year. I completed the leg today and started on the heel flap, but I have now finally convinced myself that there is no way I will be able to wear these. They are too small. I like the pattern, so I will rip these out and start again in a day or so.\n\nThe third, and most recently started sock, is my Black Bunny Hop-Along sock. I am using Black Bunny Fibers yarn, of course. This sock is coming along quickly.\n\nI'm also still working on squares for the baby afghan. The pile is getting taller but I still have more than 30 squares to make.",

        "text":"Meat Chickens: Week 6\n\nOkay, so I\u2019m starting to like these guys. Whoopsie.\n\nThey\u2019re super friendly and now they\u2019re really foraging around their pen. They come running when I go out to feed them, since they aren\u2019t free feeding now. They\u2019re very curious and are not afraid of us or the dogs at all. They drink TONS of water too, much more than our other chickens, I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s something to do with how quickly they\u2019re growing and how much they\u2019re eating.\n\nWe did lose one. Found it under their coop, head missing, mostly eviscerated, broken legs. Not sure what got it, but we\u2019ve set a trap and have not lost another one yet. They\u2019ve got about two more weeks left until we process. Looking forward to more meat in the freezer.\n\nSide note: yesterday and today I butchered our young rabbits & two of our new \u201caccidental\u201d roosters. The dogs have loved the past two days. I cooked one of the rabbits off with a pheasant in the crock pot to make some lovely broth and shredded the meat for future use.\n\nP.S. The quail are laying again!!\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

        "text":"Thrift Store Desk: Trash to Treasure\n\nEarlier this week I posted the above photo on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0of my little corner-of-the-room sewing space. This is just that, a small corner in our guest room I claimed as mine... all mine. No kid toys, no junk mail, no half-done ripped out coloring pages... just pretty. AND, this \"pretty\" I'm talking about is the DIY kinda pretty; made up of thrift store finds, dumpster dives, and DIY projects... including the desk (which is really what this is all about). Before we get to the trash to treasure desk, let me explain!\n  \u2022 Mirror: $10 -\u00a0Goodwill\n  \u2022 Clock: $1 -\u00a0Garage Sale (and it works!)\n  \u2022 Glass Vases: FREE -\u00a0Leftover wedding centerpiece items\n  \u2022 Chair:\u00a0$25 ish in supplies -\u00a0Read about this garbage rescue\/DIY project HERE\n  \u2022 Pillow: FREE -\u00a0Upcycle! Read about that one HERE\n  \u2022 Curtains: FREE - More DIY mojo on those HERE\n  \u2022 Desk: $40 - Thrift Store\n  \u2022 Sewing Machine: FREE - It was a gift if you're wondering :)\nThat's right. \u00a0Even if we round up for things like tape and paint and supplies of the sort, this whole space was probably less than $100.\n\nSo where did I get the desk? \u00a0In a tiny thrift store in a strip mall behind a Wendy's. How's that for glamorous? After being turned off by the looks of this particular thrift store, I finally went in one day and discovered a gem. Yes, the place was small and kinda crummy but it was also a food bank for our community (had no idea). \u00a0All of their items were donations and all of their profits went to buy food for their pantry (which was also in the store). Anyone could come in and pick up peanut butter, bread, canned goods, etc... free of charge, no questions asked, at any time. How cool is that? I decided to stop by often to see if I could *ahem* do my part to help and purchase items. One day I found the desk.\n\nI seriously looked twice, maybe 3 times, at the masking tape price sticker. Could it really be $40?! I asked to make sure. It was. I think I ran to pay and like a psycho calmly asked the loading guys to put it in my vehicle.... like right now!\u00a0\n\nThis picture actually makes it look in good shape... it was not. The veneer was lifting big time on the top. It was also chipped and missing in some places. There was a handle missing, some chunks of desk looked like they had been hacked off with a hammer, and it stunk like last years gym socks. But I saw the potential!\n\nIt took a week or so of glueing, sanding, filling, painting, and airing-out.\u00a0\n\nIn fact, I did the desk along side my dresser. You can read about that adventure HERE. Here they are as good buddies in my garage. :) This is why I have given up hope of parking in there. The desk was in no condition to be stained... unlike the dresser. This sucker needed paint to have a second chance at life.\n\nHere's a closeup of some of the wood filler I used on the front.\n\nI used the same white homemade chalk paint I used on the Goodwill end tables\u00a0too.\n\nI had to fill the original hardware holes in the top drawers since I wanted to use glass knobs there. The original hardware required 2 holes, the glass knobs needed only one hole in the center. So I filled, sanded, and drilled new holes.\n\nAfter it was all painted I decided to add a scaled-down version of my DIY Moroccan stencil on the sides since that is the first thing you see when you walk in the room.\nSo, I hope you like my \"trash to treasure\" desk and that you're inspired to try out that sketchy thrift store you always pass but never go in :)\n\n\n  1. That is a beautiful corner! I hope it stays \"all yours\".\n\n  2. The desk turned out fantastic & I love a pop of yellow :)\n\n  3. YOU always inspire me sister.. OMGOODNESS .. GOOD GRAVY that's beautiful and I love those curtains... STUNNING\n\n  4. What a great makeover!!!!!! Gorgeous,fantastic..:)\n\n  5. I love how your desk turned out and how clean your sewing area is... exact opposite of my area! lol.\n\n  6. How impressive are you! Well done.\n    I am currently trawling trying to find a crummy desk to give a little love to for my daughters bedroom. I hope it turns out half as well as yours!\n\n  7. I, too, am in the middle of a desk re-do. Thanks for the inspiration to keep pushing forward!\n\n  8. Gorgeous! I love the stencil on the side. Such a great idea! I'll be re painting a desk soon too and I'll have to swing by ye old craft store to see what stencils they have in stock\n\n    1. Thank you! I still use this desk all the time. Just sat down at it last night to write a few post-Christmas thank you notes! :)",
