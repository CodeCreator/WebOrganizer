        "text":"Ganga: The River of Rebirth\n\nChronicles known as Puranas narrate the tale of how Ganga came down to earth to help those who die take birth once more.\n\nA king called Sagara was once performing a yagna. If the ritual was a success, he would become Indra, king of paradise, and have access to all the pleasures of the world, including immortality. But there was already an Indra in the sky, and he could not bear the idea of being replaced. So he stole Sagara\u2019s horse that was an integral part of the ritual and hid it in the hermitage of a sage called Kapil. The sons of Sagara looked everywhere for the horse. They dug so deep that they created a crater that eventually became the receptacle of the sea. Finally they found the horse in Kapil\u2019s hermitage and they accused Kapil of theft. Kapil\u2019s eyes were shut at this time, as he was lost in deep contemplation. He had no idea of Indra\u2019s mischief.\n\nIrritated by the disturbance, he opened his eyes. So fiery was his first glance that the sons of Sagara who stood before him shouting accusations burst into flames and were reduced to a heap of ash. Indra smiled and Kapil shut his eyes once again. A heartbroken Sagara wondered, \u201cMy sons have been killed in their youth. I will die of old age. None of us will be Indra. The yagna had been abandoned midway. None of us will sip Amrita, the nectar of immortality. None of us will experience unending joy. Is every living creature doomed to die having lived such incomplete lives?\u201d\n\nSagara searched for an answer. So did his son Anshuman, and Anshuman\u2019s son Dilip and finally Dilip\u2019s son Bhagirath. Bhagirath met Garud, the eagle, the only creature who had defeated Indra in battle. He said, \u201cIf the ashes of your ancestors are washed by the Ganga they will be reborn and have a second chance of life.\u201d Unfortunately Ganga flowed in the sky.\n\nBhagirath prayed to Brahma, father of all living creatures, and he promised to persuade Ganga to descend on earth. \u201cBut beware,\u201d said the haughty river-goddess when compelled to descend, \u201cthe force of my fall will surely wash away all life on earth and crush its very foundations.\u201d Bhagirath therefore invoked Shiva. Shiva agreed to let Ganga fall on his head and thus protect the earth from direct impact. The world watched the spectacle of water descending from the sky. Indra gloated, convinced that Ganga would destroy all of humanity, and with that all threats to his reign.\n\nBut when Ganga fell on Shiva\u2019s head, she found his head was covered with thick matted hair, so thick and so densely matted that she found herself getting entangled and trapped. Far from washing away life and breaking the foundations of earth, Ganga found herself locked up atop Shiva\u2019s head. She tried to find a way out, but Shiva\u2019s locks were like a labyrinth. There was no escape. She begged and cried, and finally, Shiva relented and Ganga flowed out of Shiva\u2019s head, down the slopes of Kailasa, through the ravines of the Himalayas, onto the plains and finally towards the sea. Her bubbly movements irritated one sage called Jahnu who swallowed her whole but when Bhagirath revealed the identity and importance of the river, he released the river through his ear, after which she came to be known as his daughter, Jahnavi.\n\nThe idea of rebirth and the Ganga cannot be separated. The river comes from the land of Indra, who has access to Amrita, the nectar of immortality. Indra, the hero of Vedic hymns, lives the life everyone on earth wants to live. He is strong and powerful and attractive and invincible. All day he spends enjoying the good things in life. He does not fear aging or death. Kings of the earth, such as Sagara, envy him. They all want to live Indra\u2019s perfect life. They spend their lifetimes working towards it. Eventually everyone fails \u2013 those who die \u00a0young like Sagara\u2019s sons and even those who die old like Sagara himself. And everyone wonders, if there will ever be another chance to become Indra.\n\nA dip in the Ganga is about getting a karmic clean slate, a chance to begin life with a new balance sheet. Throwing ashes in the Ganga is about giving the dead a chance to be reborn once more, hopefully in Indra\u2019s paradise, and enjoy all things that were denied in this life. Ganga thus is all about forgiveness and second chances. It is an idea that gives hope to humanity.\n\nThe doctrine of rebirth is perhaps informed by agricultural practices on the riverbank, where crops grow and are harvested every year with cyclical regularity. Every year there are the rains, the summer heat and the winter chill. Nothing lasts forever, but everything comes back eventually. But civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia and China were also nurtured on the banks of rivers. Rebirth never featured in their stories. All of them spoke of death and an endless afterlife. They built pyramids and tombs to the dead and kept the ashes of ancestors in urns and temples, to celebrate the life that was. They did not cremate the dead and scatter ashes in a river, in hope of yet another life. This life was their one and only chance. In the river valley civilizations of India, however, the idea of a second chance took root firmly, perhaps because of men that the Greek followers of Alexander, the Great, identified as gymnosophists or the naked wise men, who imagined the world very differently.\n\nGanga\u2019s story refers to several such naked wise men, such as Kapil and Jahnu and Gotama and Agastya, but none more spectacular and magnificent as Shiva, from whose dreadlocks springs the promise of rebirth in the form of Ganga, and who smears his body with ash to remind all of the promise of soul that outlives death!\n\nShiva is the great destroyer whose worship scholars often fumble to explain. \u00a0How can a destroyer be worshipped? Few ponder over what Shiva actually destroys. Even today, writers on Shiva insist on describing him as \u2018destroyer of evil\u2019 or \u2018creative destroyer\u2019 which reveals this long discomfort with the term \u2018destroyer\u2019. Yes, Shiva is destroyer. He is Yamantaka, the destroyer of death, and Kamantaka, destroyer of desire. He is the destroyer of limitations imposed by one life.\n\nShiva, and the gymnosophists who considered him Adi-nath, or the primal teacher, offer a dual promise: a temporal promise to live as many lives one wants trying to be Indra, and a transcendental promise to break free from this foolhardy quest someday. This is not redemption or salvation or liberation. This is not enlightenment. This is just the offer of infinite second chances. With this one offer, death ceases to be a full stop; it becomes a comma. Shiva, the destroyer of death, then becomes worthy of worship, as does the river sprouting from his head.\n\n~ Dr. Devdutt Pattanaik\n\nAdd Comment\n\nClick here to post a comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Change Leaders Will be the GCs of the Future\n\nGilbert E. Forest\n\nGilbert E. Forest Egon Zehnder, Boston\n\nWhat distinguishes an excellent general counsel from a good or merely acceptable one?\n\nTo answer that question we recently mined information about more than 300 senior legal executives from among the thousands of management appraisals that we have conducted over the past several years. These evaluations are designed to help companies take stock of their available talent, improve development programs, conduct succession planning and understand their human capital following mergers or acquisitions.\n\nEvaluations are typically based on nine scaled leadership competencies: (1) Results Orientation, (2) Strategic Orientation, (3) Market Knowledge, (4) Collaboration and Influencing, (5) Developing Organizational Capability, (6) Team Leadership, (7) Change Leadership, (8) Customer Impact and (9) Functional Competency.\n\nLeadership Competencies Defined\n\n  \u2022 Results Orientation: Focusing on delivering and improving measurable business results. High performers improve the way things are done based on a thoughtful, calculated approach to risk.\n  \u2022 Strategic Orientation: Thinking long-term and outside one\u2019s own area. Requires business awareness, critical analysis and conceptualization of information in a way that defines the next steps. High performers challenge the current direction and propose new longterm direction.\n  \u2022 Market Knowledge: Understanding the market in which the business operates, including the competition, suppliers, customer base and regulatory environment. High performers segment the market and anticipate where it will go, based on understanding the drivers and the competition.\n  \u2022 Collaboration & Influencing: Working with and influencing those outside one\u2019s functional area to create a positive impact on business performance. High performers facilitate collaboration and partnerships.\n  \u2022 Developing Organizational Capability: Developing the long-term capabilities of others and the organization as a whole. High performers provide constructive behavioral feedback in a long-term career context.\n  \u2022 Team Leadership: Building effective teams in one\u2019s immediate organization. This applies to virtual or cross-functional teams, whether or not there is a formal leader. High performers build empowered teams that can develop and deliver on goals.\n  \u2022 Change Leadership: Transforming, aligning and energizing an organization. High performers create change leaders to propagate a new message.\n  \u2022 Customer Impact: Serving and building value-added relationships. High performers cultivate relationships and anticipate the customers\u2019 needs from their own perspective.\n  \u2022 Functional Competency: Mastering one\u2019s area of expertise, staying up to date, and sharing and disseminating that knowledge to drive business purposes. High performers act as business partners who can bring specialized expertise to the table when necessary.\n\nTogether, these competencies provide a predictive model of leadership for top executives of all kinds.\n\nThe results of our analysis carry interesting implications for boards and CEOs that are thinking about how best to develop top GC succession talent, and for individual legal executives who want to improve their performance. We compared the legal executives ranked as \u201coutstanding\u201d based on their competencies compared to those ranked \u201cgood,\u201d and \u201cacceptable.\u201d\n\nAmong the most striking findings was that, while functional competency (legal and regulatory knowledge in the company\u2019s areas of focus) was what distinguished the outstanding general counsel 15 years ago, today the bottom quartile in our sample have functional competency scores similar to outstanding GCs. Our data showed the functional competency level of all GCs to be generally high.\n\nAlthough CEOs have for some time been seeking more business-savvy GCs, the difference in market knowledge between outstanding and ordinary GCs is marginal. We would have expected outstanding GCs to be ahead of their peers in this competency.\n\nChange Leaders Will Be the GCs of the Future - Image\nFigure 1: Outstanding GCs and average CEOs\n\nWe found that outstanding GCs are significantly more skilled than their peers across the remaining leadership competencies. In addition, we found a meaningful negative correlation between time in one\u2019s role and competency level. Legal executives who rank highest have been in their current role for the shortest time. This suggests that many chief legal officers are simply not able to maintain as competitive a skill set over time.\n\nTheir replacements are being promoted with competency levels higher than those of their predecessors. This might suggest that once in the top roles, legal executives are not able to keep up with rapidly-changing demand for leadership competencies, so companies benefit from replacing them. It also suggests that legal executives need to find ways to benchmark and develop their skills to keep pace with the best in class. We advocate that legal executives understand and benchmark these competencies early in their careers.\n\nTrying to understand the gulf in skills between excellent GCs and their peers, we compared outstanding GCs to CEOs. The outstanding GCs have evolved leadership skills to the level of the average CEOs on almost every competency. They surpass the CEOs in collaboration.\n\nThe three gaps are in strategic orientation, change leadership and market knowledge. We believe outstanding GCs are outstanding because they emulate CEOs in order to be the business partners they seek.\n\nThese competencies are put into action in concrete ways by outstanding GCs. The GC of a $20B energy company has the lead attorneys sit down with their respective business executives annually and review the business plan, to determine where the legal department brings support and value. The lead attorney and the business leader agree on turnaround times, priorities and a cost\/benefit analysis of the services provided, and they agree in writing.\n\nTwo or more of these competencies often dovetail. For example, a GC in an innovation-driven Fortune 100 company asks his attorneys to spend two days per week working on-site in research and development to discuss innovation, and determine how to support it. The organization\u2019s team rating of the legal group and the legal team\u2019s satisfaction have never been higher\u2014 results that affirm the GC\u2019s skill at combining customer impact with team leadership.\n\nA comparison of outstanding GCs to outstanding CEOs provides a glimpse of the outstanding GCs of the future. Outstanding CEOs are seeking GCs whose competencies match theirs. Outstanding GCs already match top CEOs in collaborating and influencing, and are not far behind in developing organizational leadership.\n\nCompanies need to offer their legal executives development opportunities and establish development and leadership programs that will groom high potential internal legal talent for GC roles. Failing this, legal executives will continue to seek development opportunities by leaving their organizations.\n\nInvestment in top legal talent brings returns. Internal candidates with developed competencies clearly have the advantage in understanding the business. With an aging population and a complex legal and regulatory environment, companies not developing their internal legal talent will face an increasingly competitive environment for external recruits. Boards, CEOs and GCs must become aware of these competencies and establish plans that give their legal executives the opportunity to develop.\n\nAs the bar rises, today\u2019s outstanding GCs will likely strengthen their skills in the two areas where they lag outstanding CEOs: market knowledge, and change leadership. The outstanding GC of the future will be expected to perform on a par with outstanding CEOs in leadership competencies. As their work evolves, they are also likely to see new competencies emphasized.\n\nOver the next decade, the \u201csoft skills\u201d \u2013 those that address issues of people and the organization \u2013 will constitute a much higher percentage of the GC role than they have in the past. As companies become increasingly diverse, international, and collaborative, the emphasis on engaging thoughtfully with a wide variety of people, in contrast to using simple commandand- control levers, will grow. With demographic changes decreasing the pool of currently outstanding candidates, the emphasis on \u201cgrowing your own talent\u201d will also continue.\n\nWe also believe that as outstanding GCs continue to develop their skills, they not only will come to resemble outstanding CEOs in their level of competency, but will increasingly often become CEOs themselves.\n\nCo-authored by Stephen P.

        "text":"Technology today is\u00a0similar to opposite sides of a coin. There's\u00a0the face where all can be cast into the limelight, and\u00a0there\u2019s the\u00a0backside where most of\u00a0the behind the scenes action\u00a0tends to go unnoticed.\u00a0\n\nNot a lot of\u00a0people consider all of the mechanics that go into crafting social media.\u00a0Though platforms are meant to be personable, it's easy to\u00a0forget\u00a0how technological they are.\n\nLast year, of\u00a0over 330 million Twitter\u00a0users, 74 percent utilized the social platform for news, according to statistics gathered by the Pew Research Center. When the platform first aired, its sole purpose was to connect family and friends. Now,\u00a0the\u00a0reasons for one to create a Twitter\u00a0account are endless.\u00a0\n\nJack Dorsey, CEO and co-founder of Twitter,\u00a0set out to create a\u00a0public\u00a0medium\u00a0for anyone to use. Of course as technology evolves, so do the standards they\u2019re bound to. Twitter\u00a0has adapted to\u00a0keep up with the change in people\u2019s interests and\u00a0the reasons they use social media.\u00a0Social media outlets are\u00a0designed to run based on\u00a0an\u00a0algorithm. This formula can be adjusted and manipulated to address whatever the creators\u2019 main concern for the platform is at the time.\n\n\"Social media outlets are\u00a0designed to run based on\u00a0an\u00a0algorithm.\"\n\nDorsey aimed to\u00a0take Twitter to the\u00a0next level. He and his team crafted an algorithm that would eliminate harassment on the platform, while also encouraging\u00a0users to have meaningful dialect on popular discussion topics.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe spirit of the [algorithm] is that we want to take the burden off the person receiving abuse or mob-like behavior,\u201d Jack Dorsey\u00a0told\u00a0The Guardian.\n\nHowever, the newest edits to the algorithm have created user issues, most notably\u00a0the debacle where users were\u00a0falsely\u00a0shown as having liked tweets published by President Donald Trump and Senator\u00a0Ted Cruz.\n\nIn The Public's Eye\n\nTwitter recommends content based on the accounts users interact with.\u00a0This creates awkward tension especially when it comes to political views.\u00a0Some users, like\u00a0Felicia Swartzenberg, a fourth year Journalism and Museum Studies double major,\u00a0exhibit contempt towards the false interaction.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to have my friends and followers thinking I support someone who I am very much against,\u201d she said.\n\nApart from that slight glitch, some users find that the algorithm\u00a0has its moments.\u00a0Andy Brauchler, a fourth year English major from Stony Brook University, understands the logistics behind the algorithm.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSometimes I like what I see, sometimes it has nothing to do with my interests. Same issue when Twitter shows me what people I follow have liked,\u201d\u00a0he said.\n\nSocial media often\u00a0has the misfortune of people constantly criticizing it. People\u00a0rarely seem to be\u00a0satisfied, which leads the teams behind the\u00a0platforms to do whatever\u00a0they can to\u00a0keep users active.\u00a0According to The Statistics Portal, between 2010 and 2018,\u00a0a million of\u00a0Twitter's active users have decreased their activity or given up the platform altogether. Though that may seem minor compared to the remaining 335 million users, it\u2019s an alarming sign of rough\u00a0times ahead at their corporate office.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhile they [social media platforms] are trying to help get more people content, they are really preventing people from seeing new content, in my opinion,\u201d Swartzenberg said. \u201cI mean look at Facebook ...\u00a0the algorithms came all from a business standpoint. They are trying to make money off of as many people as possible, so they\u2019re optimizing that.\u201d\n\nFor those who are old enough to remember, MySpace\u00a0used to be everyone\u2019s go-to social media outlet. Then came Facebook and Twitter, followed\u00a0by\u00a0Snapchat and Instagram,\u00a0each platform having\u00a0advantages over the previous one. Perhaps that\u2019s just social media's\u00a0circle of life. \"In with the new, out with the old,\u201d\u00a0as the saying goes.\n\nNo Clear Lines\n\nLast month, The Guardian\u00a0released an article posing the idea that algorithms should be held responsible for the issues and damage they cause. Technology does as we we order it to.\n\nAlgorithms were meant to solve flaw after flaw that social media platforms encountered. They were created by people to ideally offer a better\u00a0virtual environment. These are the unseen bumps in the road that sometimes pop up. They don\u2019t have any obvious right or wrong ways to address them.\u00a0Sometimes, they just work. Other times, they don\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nSwartzenberg and Brauchler\u00a0both agree that Twitter's current algorithm\u00a0needs some tweaking.\u00a0As users push to have Twitter's algorithm changed, negative\u00a0commentary from users on Twitter is what drives the initiative to change the platform.\u00a0With technology\u00a0comes a trial\u00a0and\u00a0error period. Social media will probably\u00a0never be perfect,\u00a0nor should that be the goal.\u00a0Creators of the beloved platforms\u00a0can adjust these algorithms with endless outcomes, but at the end of the day\u00a0users are always going to find an aspect to critique.",

        "text":"A convertible car being driven hands-free by a woman - driving higher education's CMS needs concept\nPHOTO: Shutterstock\n\nThe education sector has been one of the most affected by COVID-19 pandemic. It has forced higher education institutions to make unprecedented shifts in the use of technology, especially when it comes to publishing and distributing content to students, faculty, and staff.\n\nFor most higher education institutions, a content management system (CMS) has been the neural center that has made that transformation possible, keeping information centralized and enabling them to publish content faster. In fact, according to research from NYC Design, 83.8% of the 4,000 surveyed higher education institutions are currently using a CMS.\u00a0\n\nOverall, across institutions, three CMS dominate the market: WordPress (40.8%), Drupal (19.5%), and OU Campus (9.5%), with the rest of CMS garnering less than 7% of adoption. To uncover the state of CMS usage and what decision-makers in the higher education sector expect from a CMS, we've asked the experts.\u00a0\n\nThe Impact of the Pandemic Over Higher Education's Information Management\n\nThe main goal of educational institutions is to ensure that education's quality stays the same, even during these kinds of circumstances. To achieve this, most universities have adapted to new methods of content delivery for students and faculty. One example of this is the integrations of CMS with Alexa for voice content delivery.\u00a0\n\nAlso, the lack of face-to-face interactions has enhanced the value of data. The more data about the students you have, the better experience you can provide, especially in terms of better classes and increased outcomes.\u00a0\n\nFor example, according to Arbazz Nizami, Director of Digital Marketing for Enrollment at Claremont, CA-based Claremont Lincoln University, \"prior to the pandemic, universities were very much reliant on the status quo, and students have been demanding reforms that would increase equity and inclusion. Now, we understand we can't rely on the status quo we have to innovate. Content management systems must incorporate as much data as possible into the student experience to create a customized experience that caters to various types of learners.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSimilarly, as a consequence of the pandemic, digital transformation has reached more higher education institutions, bringing increased agility. Rick Merrick, CIO at Chicago, IL.-based TCS Education System, \"Higher education institutions can be overly bureaucratic. A CMS that is lightweight, flexible, future-proof, and secure is necessary to make them more agile.\"\n\nRelated Article:\u00a0Learning to Adapt to the Pandemic-Induced Educational Crisis\u00a0\n\nCMS and the Future of Institutions of Higher Education\n\nHigher education institutions' needs are quite different from those of an eCommerce or a B2B company website. That means that higher education has become a distinct market in the eyes of CMS vendors. In fact, recent research by UX Collective revealed that CMS are targeting post-secondary institutions with tailored solutions designed specifically for them.\u00a0\n\nTherefore, it's probable that CMS and DXP will become even better at understanding the needs of students and faculty in the near future. However, for that to happen, content management systems will have to disrupt themselves too. Merrick believes that \"CMS need to evolve from just content delivery technologies to DXP. CMS need to be easy to integrate with other cloud technologies to ensure the student digital experience can be replicated across the entire lifecycle.\"\n\nAlso, Merrick is of the opinion that C-suite executives in the higher education sector need some disruption too. He says, \u201cit's not just about selecting a system that is easy to manage, administer, and create content, but one that makes the student experience meaningful and convenient.\"\u00a0\n\nSimilarly, Annie Koh, Professor Emeritus at the Singapore-based Singapore Management University, believes that, for higher education institutions, the future lies in \"creating a learn from everywhere education system.\u201d She explains that the pandemic has only accelerated a trend towards more digital, collaborative learning, and that is one benefit which must be embraced.\n\nCMS and DXP have the tools to help higher education institutions deliver more personalized learning experiences to students. Headless CMS, in particular, have the potential to deliver AI-based personalization and omnichannel experiences for students, so they have access to educational materials, announcements, and can maintain communication with faculty members.\u00a0\n\nPotential Roadblocks\n\nNevertheless, this future isn't free of roadblocks, Scanlan believes. For instance, \"universities haven't really begun to use artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to enhance their student journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cCMS of the future will understand student behavior at a micro level, and use very sophisticated algorithms to understand your student enrollment trends and data. Even helping put students in classes based on what's best for their journey,\" she says.\n\nWith that in mind, what do higher education institutions need to ask from their CMS?\n\n  \u2022 Granular personalization\n  \u2022 Omnichannel content delivery\n  \u2022 Headless or hybrid architecture\n  \u2022 Support for NoCode or LowCode\u00a0\n  \u2022 Integration with third-party softwares\u00a0\n\nBesides technical features and support, higher education institutions need a vendor with enough product vision to show them why its CMS will enable them to wade through the specificities of the post-secondary education market. Last, it needs to be a constantly evolving product with versions appearing regularly and a roadmap that benefits your institution.",

        "text":"Viewpoint: \u201cThe Lost Honour\u201d of dying Google+\n\nBy Joshua Madden\nA&E Editor\n\nThink back to this past summer for a minute. I know it\u2019s hard to do with the weather finally starting to get chilly here in Waco, but reflect on those sunny days. The time spent lounging by the pool. The time when Google+ was supposed to be the Facebook killer.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that seem like forever ago?\n\nGoogle+, Google\u2019s most recent attempt at creating a viable social network, appears to be dead in the water. I was only even reminded of its existence because of an e-mail I got informing me that Google Wave, Google\u2019s previous half-hearted attempt at creating some kind of social experience online, was being shut down. The question I had to ask myself was this: How long until Google+ follows suit?\n\nWhen Google+ was first released, I\u2019ll admit it intrigued me. The Android app was solid. The invite-only feature made me feel special. The fact that it wasn\u2019t blocked everywhere with a proxy gave it a leg up over Facebook.\n\nThe problem, of course, was that it still wasn\u2019t Facebook. All of my friends were on Facebook. Even with Google+, 1,083 of my friends are still there. I don\u2019t even have 100 friends on Google+.\n\nNobel laureate Heinrich B\u00f6ll\u2019s \u201cThe Lost Honour of Katharina Blum\u201d follows the beautiful Katharina. Everything appears to be going her way until she falls in love with a murderer and quickly finds herself under investigation from the authorities.\n\nThe book is one of my all-time favorites, partially because of the fact that it speaks to something larger than the story contained within the pages. Who hasn\u2019t seen something beautiful (like Katharina) find itself in trouble because of a few careless mistakes?\n\nObviously there is some debate about whether or not Ms. Blum is actually to blame for her downfall \u2014 you\u2019ll have to read the book so you can decide for yourself \u00ad\u2014 but I personally thought that part of her problem is that she was too arrogant and thought too highly of herself. Could there be a more direct parallel to Google+ and its rapid decline in popularity?\n\nThe reason that no one shifted from Facebook to Google+ was that there was no reason to shift from Facebook to Google+. Google+ had no notable features that Facebook did not have and Google executives seemed to think that we should all move over simply because we love Google, even though many of those executives did not appear to embrace the site themselves.\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, I do love Google. I think it\u2019s clearly the best search engine on the Internet and it makes it so easy to bring disparate things together. This was, however, the exact reason that I was never sold on Google+. All of the characteristic ease of use of Google Non-Plus didn\u2019t seem to make its way over to Google+. That\u2019s too bad.\n\nI write this column not to rejoice in the downfall of Google+, but to mourn it. There are serious privacy issues with Facebook that I\u2019m not convinced will ever be adequately addressed.\n\nI want Google+ to succeed and I think there is still a chance to make that happen. But it\u2019s going to take some real effort. They might start by taking their own \u201c+1\u201d concept to heart. Why can\u2019t Google+ one-up Facebook?\n\nFacebook is often slow to address issues that people would like to see addressed. Why is it that years after its initial implementation, the \u201cLike\u201d button on Facebook remains alone? Why is it that we don\u2019t have \u201cDislike\u201d buttons or \u201cLove\u201d buttons? Even Xanga had varied amounts of \u201ceProps\u201d that could be left for users.\n\nThese are easy areas that Google+ could have capitalized on, but instead, they chose only to give us a slightly more muddled version of the \u201cLike\u201d button.\n\nIf we\u2019re going to shift over to Google+, we need a reason to do so. The Google brand will get me to sign up, but it won\u2019t get me to stay there, especially when my 1,083 friends are staying on Facebook.\n\nThinking that you\u2019re more important than my 1,083 friends makes me think you and Katharina Blum might have something in common.\n\nPlease send comments to",

        "text":"\ufeff Lin Yi-shih a product of dark side of \u2018guanxi\u2019 - Taipei Times\nFri, Jul 06, 2012 - Page 8\u3000News List\n\nLin Yi-shih a product of dark side of \u2018guanxi\u2019\n\nBy Hsu Yu-fang \u8a31\u53c8\u65b9\n\nFormer Cabinet secretary-general Lin Yi-shih (\u6797\u76ca\u4e16) reportedly admitted to accepting NT$63 million (US$2.11 million) in bribes from Ti Yung Co, a metal-recycling company. This was news that shocked the political world. However, for the average person, such scandals are not all that surprising and are almost something to be expected because they are but a reflection of the darker side of Taiwan\u2019s political and economic culture.\n\nThere is a popular Chinese saying that, \u201cIf you have guanxi (\u95dc\u4fc2, connections) you will be okay, but if you don\u2019t, then you have problems.\u201d Having guanxi and using it to your advantage to get around normal avenues for doing things is part of everyday life in Chinese societies around the world \u2014 and Taiwan is no exception.\n\nI live in Hualien and often have to book a train ticket to Taipei and back. Each time I need a ticket, I have to get up early to book tickets online the morning of the trip and even this does not work every time. However, there are always quite a few people that always manage to get a ticket anytime they want by making one simple phone call. When people are employing such methods to obtain a train ticket, is it any wonder they do the same thing when it comes to industries involving tens of billions of New Taiwan dollars?\n\nTo put it simply, when there is something to be gained, people will use their guanxi to get it. Supply and demand are what make guanxi possible. Those in business are fond of money and politicians have power. Taiwan\u2019s guanxi culture is created when these two spheres mix and interests and benefits are exchanged.\n\nTherefore, nobody was really surprised when Lin was accused of corruption, and they most probably think that this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to corruption involving government officials and businesses.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that elections are hugely expensive affairs. It is often said that it takes millions to get elected to a city or county council and tens of millions to get elected to the legislature. Stories of people who spend hundreds of billions on elections also abound. If that is what it takes to get elected, then who on earth can afford it, unless they are backed by massive family wealth? As a result, politicians often look to wealthy businesspeople for support. After they get elected, they are naturally happy to speak up for their business interests. Alternatively, they can use the power vested in them as public representatives to apply pressure or solicit bribes to cover their election costs.\n\nLin was elected as a legislator four times and after losing in the Kaohsiung County commissioner elections in 2005 and in the legislative elections this year, one can imagine he must have needed quite a bit of funding.\n\nThe whole Lin incident can be explained as a product of a culture that has developed for a long time between political and business circles, and it is therefore unsurprising. However, this is also what makes it scary and dangerous.\n\nTaiwan has often been criticized as being one of the world\u2019s ugliest and dirtiest nations \u2014 a key reason being Taiwanese are used to how things are and the government ignores things like illegally parked cars and hawker stands set up where they are not allowed to. If everyone is used to these connections between government and business, then this country is well beyond help. Given its domestic situation, how can Taiwan even begin to talk about boosting its international competitiveness or about catching up with Singapore or South Korea?\n\nThis story has been viewed 2993 times.\nTOP top",

        "text":"A notion of noir\n\nWritten in 1988 for the French market, Derek Raymond's Nightmare in the Street is a strange and poetic existential fable, says Chris Petit\nNightmare in the Street by Derek Raymond\nBuy Nightmare in the Street at the Guardian bookshop\n\nNightmare in the Street\nby Derek Raymond\n184pp, Serpent's Tail, \u00a37.99\n\nFirst as novelist Robin Cook, then reinventing himself as a crime writer, this old Etonian proved that life and literature were more interesting for eliminating that staple of English fiction, the middle class. As Derek Raymond he redefined English crime writing, combining the attitudes of American hardboiled noir and French existentialism. Nightmare in the Street, a policier set in Paris, and previously published only in France, is a strange and poetic existential fable.\n\nCook's life and writing were a calculated social experiment: downwardly mobile toff goes underground, absorbing whatever gets put in front of him to rework into fiction. Unlike many writers, Cook had a colourful \"other life\", operating illegal gaming tables in the 1950s, selling porn and running building scams in \"Swinging London\". Cook never disguised his background: the upper-class accent lent shady enterprises a respectable front, and A Crust on Its Uppers (1962) remains an unmatched lexicon of rackety London.\n\nThe mid-80s Factory series, written after years of enforced exile in France, had none of the dull procedural characteristics of the middlebrow crime novel that has propped up TV ratings for years. The initial murder in The Devil's Home on Leave has such an obvious signature that the identity of the killer is immediately revealed. (The series' basic idea of unexplained deaths was borrowed and diluted by the BBC's Waking the Dead.) The Raymond novels were always too solitary and austere to get made into TV. No sidekicks. No hobbies. Not much by way of character. Raymond's obsession was the state of death, a constant present, subordinating and excusing the need for niceties.\n\nHis reputation lay in proving that hardboiled fiction could be made to work in England, leaving Morse, Midsomer Murders, Christie, PD James et al behind. He was appreciated more in his adopted France where they make a fetish of noir - Claude Chabrol filmed one of the Factory books. Cook understood implicitly the dark thing that lurks at the heart of noir, and his tone of stoicism and disdain gave the voice authority. For all the levelling that takes place in the stories, the patrician voice is more of a companion to the work of that other old Etonian, Anthony Powell, than to the average English crime novel. It was a class act, summarised by the modified beatnik look: beret, Gauloise, everything black.\n\nHowever remarkable the books are for their uncensored quality and naked transparency - a mind imagining the worst and then topping it - the author remains mysterious, his motives hard to fathom. Lack of censoring sometimes extends to an absence of editing and, like anyone who has spent too long in pubs, he could go on a bit. But the discomfort caused by reading him is genuine and twofold: the laconic, unremitting bleakness of vision and a faint underlying suspicion that the old con artist is still at work and the reader (and critic) is viewed as one more in a long line of mug punters.\n\nCook died in 1994. Nightmare in the Street is an anomaly, written in 1988 for the French market and set in Paris, and interesting for its cultural refraction, which makes the city's low-life milieu seem even more scummy than London's. The method remains the same, relying less on observation than memory, site-specific in some respects but lacking any effort at tourist flavour. Both cities form part of the same urban hell, one defined by state of mind more than architecture or geography.\n\nIt is a strange take. Although written in English, it reads like a translation and differs from its Factory counterparts in its emotional encryptions. These are reminiscent of the last film of the great Jean-Pierre Melville, Un Flic, which progresses along similar lines of irresistible fate, tapped out with the terseness of Morse code. The plot is an existential doodle of doomed romanticism, in which a busted cop takes part in an illegal shooting to protect a criminal mate, loses his wife when she gets blown up instead of him - he is left picking her bits off the bushes long after other writers would have cut away - and sets off on the revenge trail. The Jacobean sensibility is flagged by references to the year 1600 and how nothing has changed. For all its noirish, hardboiled elements, Nightmare in the Street is a cross-genre exercise - essentially a ghost story, a communion with the dead, who are as real as the living - set largely in limbo, in a state of pre-violence, that ante-room to death where Kleber felt himself to be \"more a notion of a man than a real one\".\n\n\u00b7 Chris Petit's The Passenger is published by Simon & Schuster",

        "text":"Cindy Bandle, Press Director for Chicago's Goodman Theatre, Is Dead\n\nObituaries \u00a0 Cindy Bandle, Press Director for Chicago's Goodman Theatre, Is Dead\nCindy Bandle, the respected press director of Goodman Theatre, died on May 9, the Chicago theatre announced. Ms. Bandle had been battling cancer for three years. She was 49.\n\nMs. Bandle, a tall, elegant woman with shoulder-length ash-blonde hair, became the Goodman's press director in 1985, and her two-decade tenure saw the theatre rise to national prominence and become one of the biggest and most important nonprofits in the United States.\n\nAmong the shows she helped publicize were several famous collaborations between Goodman artistic director Robert Falls and actor Brian Dennehy, including Death of a Salesman, and a number of plays that later transferred to New York. These included A Moon for the Misbegotten, Hollywood Arms and several August Wilson plays, including King Hedley II, Seven Guitars and The Piano Lesson. The Stephen Sondheim musical Bounce also had its premiere at the Goodman.\n\nShe was also on duty when the Goodman made a long-awaited move from its old home in the Art Institute of Chicago to a new North Loop complex, located on Dearborn Street between Randolph and Lake, the historic site of the Garrick and Woods theatres and the landmark Harris and Selwyn theatres. The two-theatre venue cost $44 million.\n\nThe Goodman's Falls and executive director Roche Schulfer said, in a joint statement, \"her dedication and professionalism have been essential to the Goodman's success over the past two decades. Her passion and loyalty to the theater have been beyond compare. But most of all she was an extraordinary colleague and a trusted friend to all of us.\"\n\nCynthia Bandle was born on Oct. 31, 1955, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She grew up in various places, including St. Louis, Eugene, Oregon, and spent her formative years in McLean, Virginia. She was in a manner of speaking born into her profession, as her mother owned a PR agency in Washington, D.C. Two major clients were Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus and the Washington Ballet. She met her husband Alton while doing the press for the Washington Ballet. They married on August 8, 1981, and moved to Chicago in September of 1983. Soon after, she was hired by the Goodman.\n\nServices will be private. A remembrance of Ms. Bandle will be held at the Goodman on a date to be announced.\n\nToday\u2019s Most Popular News:\n\nBlocking belongs\non the stage,\nnot on websites.\n\nOur website is made possible by\ndisplaying online advertisements to our visitors.\n\nPlease consider supporting us by\nwhitelisting with your ad blocker.\nThank you!",
