According to the Wall Street Journal, that day may be coming soon. \u201cThanks to ride sharing and the looming introduction of self-driving vehicles, the entire model of car ownership is being upended\u2014and very soon may not look anything like it has for the past century.\u00a0Drivers, for instance, may no longer be drivers, relying instead on hailing a driverless car on demand, and if they do decide to buy, they will likely share the vehicle\u2014by renting it out to other people when it isn\u2019t in use.\u201d\n\nYour Tesla May Soon Pay For Itself was originally published on CleanTechnica.\n\nTo read more from CleanTechnica, join over 50,000 other subscribers: Google+ | Email | Facebook | RSS | Twitter.\n\nYour Tesla May Soon Pay For Itself syndicated from Clean Technica\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

It is a symptom of a steady drop in driving standards as a whole, epitomised by the constant traffic news about motorways in the UK being closed at some point during the week because of accidents.\n\nSpeed is the only aspect of the Highway Code that is policed. Tailgating, middle-lane morons, an inability to overtake safely and a general lack of respect for other road users are just some of the things that must be tackled by education and enforcement.\n\nWe need a national road safety campaign aimed at everyone, and fewer excuses.\n\nStephen Mason\nIbstock, Leics\n\nWant to read more?\nRegister with a few details to continue reading this article.\nAlready a subscriber?
