        "text":"Government and state of Chile\n\nChile is a democratic state with a presidential republican system. The Constitution establishes three independent branches: the Executive, the Legislative, and the Judicial.\n\nVersi\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1ol Estado de Chile\n\nExecutive Branch\n\nThe\u00a0President of the Republic\u00a0is both chief of state and\u00a0head of government, and is elected every four years by popular vote.\u00a0 The current President,\u00a0Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era Echenique, was elected in 2010.\u00a0\u00a0 Under current Chilean law, the President may only hold office for a single four-year period, without the possibility of immediate re-election.\n\nThe President is in charge of the general administration of the government, as well as drafting, endorsing, and promulgating laws. He or she is also empowered to appoint the maximum regional authorities in the country \u2013\u00a0the Intendants of the 15 regions and the Governors of the 53 provinces. The President may also appoint and remove ministers from the cabinet, as well as their closest collaborators.\n\nLegislative Branch\n\nThe work of the legislature takes place in the National Congress, comprised of the\u00a0Chamber of Deputies\u00a0and the\u00a0Senate.\n\nThe country\u2019s citizens elect deputies every four years and senators every eight using a unique binomial system that is designed to promote bipartisanship.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the system, each coalition can present two candidates for the two Senate and two lower-chamber seats apportioned to each chamber\u2019s electoral districts. Only if the leading coalition ticket outpolls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain\u00a0both seats.\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies is comprised of 120 representatives. Each one of the districts represented by the Deputies has at least one \u201ccomuna\u201d, or municipality, the smallest of the country\u2019s political-administrative units.\n\nIn addition to drafting and amending laws, deputies engage in oversight of\u00a0government activities\u00a0in accordance with the powers that the Constitution bestows upon them.\n\nThe Senate is comprised of\u00a038 representatives. Each of its constituencies is a single region which elects two senators. Its principal responsibility is to work toward the formation of laws, together with the Chamber of Deputies.\u00a0 Its exclusive powers include hearing the accusations the Chamber of Deputies present against certain authorities, to give or deny its consent to presidential actions in those cases required by the Constitution or the law, and to decide on the impeachment of a government authority, though only in very exceptional cases.\n\nJudicial Branch\n\nThe Chilean\u00a0Judicial Branch\u00a0is empowered to hear civil and criminal cases, resolve them, and execute their rulings. The highest court is the Supreme Court, which has\u00a021 judges\u00a0appointed by the President of the Republic subject to prior Senate approval.\n\nAlong with the Supreme Court, the judicial branch is comprised principally of permanent courts including the Appeals Courts, the Court Presidents and Judges, Trial Courts, Guarantee Courts, and Criminal Oral Trial Courts.\n\nIn addition there exist special tribunals, such as the Family Courts, the Labor Trial Courts, the Labor and Pension Collection Courts and Military Tribunals in times of peace.\n\nOver the last decade\u00a0Chile\u00a0underwent a profound judicial reform that has transformed the criminal procedures system from one based on an inquisitive procedure that had been in effect since the early 19th century to a modernized accusatory model with oral trials.\n\nThe new Criminal Procedures Code establishes that investigations and accusations in criminal cases be placed in the hands of the recently created\u00a0Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, an autonomous institution for the administration of justice.\n\nThe same reform created the\u00a0Public Defender\u2019s Office\u00a0for criminal cases, an institution under the supervision of the\u00a0President of the Republic\u00a0through the\u00a0Justice Ministry\u00a0that is in charge of representing those accused of a crime who do not have an attorney.\n\nThe transformation of the criminal procedures system also created the\u00a0Guarantee Courts\u00a0to protect the rights of victims, witnesses, and the accused during proceedings, along with the Criminal Oral Trial Courts. The latter are presided over by a bench of judges charged with hearing and guiding the debate during oral trials. They subsequently determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.\n\nThis post is also available in Spanish",

        "text":"\n\nRamey, Estelle R.\n\nwomen university stress national\n\nBorn Stella Rosemary Rubin, August 23, 1917, in Detroit, MI; died of complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, September 8, 2006, in Bethesda, MD. Endocrinologist. Estelle R. Ramey, an endocrinologist, was best known for her public challenges to society\u2019s myths about the physiological\u2014especially hormonal\u2014differences between the genders as they relate to political and social roles. In 1970, she came to national prominence for stating that there was no hormonal reason for women not to hold executive positions, including the presidency, which led to her nicknames \u201cMort Sahl of the women\u2019s movement\u201d and \u201cGeorge Burns with an X chromosome.\u201d Endlessly quotable, Ramey was a popular feminist speaker on related topics and drew on her own background as a respected female scientist to support her views.\n\nBorn in 1917 in Detroit, Michigan, Ramey was the daughter of Jewish immigrants. Her father was a gambler while her mother, a native of France, was illiterate. The family, which included two siblings, moved to Brooklyn when she was infant. Ramey\u2019s father died when she was an adolescent, but her mother emphasized the importance of education and her daughter\u2019s ability to do anything despite their impoverished existence.\n\nRamey was a gifted student who was able to skip more than one grade. After graduating from high school at the age of 15, she entered Brooklyn College. Graduating in 1937 with bachelor\u2019s degrees in mathematics and biology, Ramey was hired as a chemistry teacher at Queens College while she earned her master\u2019s degree in chemistry at Columbia University. She completed the degree in 1940.\n\nAfter marrying James Ramey and moving with him to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1941 so he could work for the Tennessee Valley Authority, Ramey experienced discrimination. She applied for a position teaching chemistry at the University of Tennessee, but was turned down because its chairman believed she should be taking care of her husband at home. When World War II started and the military draft decreased the school\u2019s faculty, the then-pregnant Ramey was offered a position but only at 33 percent of the pay of the man she replaced. Despite the pay, she took the job.\n\nWhen World War II ended, the Rameys briefly moved to Washington, D.C., before her husband\u2019s new position at the Atomic Energy Commission required a move to Chicago. There, Ramey earned her doctorate in 1950 from the University of Chicago. Her thesis focused on how stress responses are related to the nervous system. After completing her Ph.D., Ramey spent around six years teaching at the University of Chicago\u2019s medical school.\n\nIn 1956, the Rameys moved back to Washington, D.C., where her husband had a new job. Ramey took a position at the Georgetown University School of Medicine where she spent the rest of her career. There, she taught physiology and biophysics, while she continued conducting research in endocrinology. Her research continued the work she began on her thesis: looking at how stress hormones affected both men and women. She was also an expert in other bodily hormones.\n\nOver the years, Ramey expressed frustration that the male-dominated scientific establishment would not look at the similarities and differences in how the sexes were affected by stress hormones and related phenomenon. She believed that such studies could help both genders live better, longer lives, in part because, on average, women have a lifespan that is seven to nine years longer than men. Ramey\u2019s own work also found that the female of all species are tougher overall than the male counterparts, even in terms of stamina.\n\nIn 1970, Ramey took a very public stand on the matter when an official of the Democratic National Committee, retired surgeon Dr. Edgar F. Berman, stated that hormone fluxes brought on by menstrual cycles and menopause made women unsuitable for higher office. She responded to this slight in a letter published in the Washington Evening Star . Ramey pointed out that President John F. Kennedy suffered from Addison\u2019s disease, a hormonal imbalance disorder requiring medication that could cause mood swings, and he handled both the presidency and the Cuban missile crisis with this condition. Ramey also noted that her studies found that women handled stress better than men in physiological terms.\n\nBuilding on this moment, Ramey launched a career as an educating yet witty public speaker. She first debated Berman at the National Women\u2019s Press Club, and was declared the winner by the Washington Post . Berman was soon forced to resign from the Democratic National Committee. Ramey continued to speak all over the United States on women\u2019s issues. She was also author of numerous articles for publications, including Ms. , as well as two books.\n\nRamey was also respected in the academic and medical worlds. She was a founder and one-time president of the Association for Women in Science, an advocacy group, and a former member of the President\u2019s Advisory Committee for Women. She retired from Georgetown in 1987, but continued to speak to both academic and lay audiences for years. Ramey also regularly attended Renaissance Weekends which were brought to prominence by President Bill Clinton during his time in office.\n\nRamey died at the age of 89 on September 8, 2006, at her home in Bethesda, Maryland, of complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. She is survived by her husband, her daughter, Drucilla; her son, James; and five grandchildren.\n\nRamirez, Susan E.

Christine Lagarde grew up in Normandy, and as a teenager she studied on exchange at the Holton Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland. She earned a law degree from the University of Paris and did graduate work at the Institute of Political Studies at Aix-en-Provence in southern France. She began working in France for the US-based law firm Baker & McKenzie in 1981. As noted by Forbes, \"Rising quickly, she became a partner in 1987, managing partner of the Paris office in 1991 and chairman in 1999. She was just 43.\" She left the company to become France's trade minister in 2005. Tall and striking, with silver hair, she became known for her brainy management style, calm persistence in negotiations, and frank honesty. (The French press labeled her Madame La Gaffe after some early blunt statements caused an uproar.) In 2007, new French President Nicolas Sarkozy named her minister of agriculture, and then one month later made her France's finance minister. Lagarde was the first woman to hold the post. She helped to push through pension reforms and an easing of the ironclad 35-hour work week, and was widely praised for working with other major countries to ride out the economic crash of 2008. Christine Lagarde became head of the International Monetary Fund in July of 2011 at a time of crisis in the organization, after the sudden resignation of its former head, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Her five-year term runs through 2016. She was named a Chevalier in the French Legion of Honor in 2000.\n\nExtra credit:\n\nChristine Lagarde has been married twice.

(Fred Oluoch, Pan African Parliament Soon to Make Laws Binding AU Members, THE EAST AFRICAN (Nov. 22, 2010), The Parliament is an AU organ established through the Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community Relating to the Pan- African Parliament. The Protocol was adopted in March 2001 and entered into force in December 2003. (List of Countries Which Have Signed, Ratified\/Acceded to the Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community Relating to the Pan-African Parliament, AU website, (last visited Nov. 22, 2010).)\n\nAlthough currently restricted to exercising an advisory role, the Parliament is expected to eventually become a legislative body. The Protocol provides that although the Parliament will be restricted to advisory and consultative powers at the beginning, it should eventually be given the authority to make laws. (Protocol, arts. 2(3) & 11, AU website, (last visited Nov. 22, 2010).) The Parliament, during its Third Ordinary Session (held Oct. 4 -14, 2010), debated its transformation into a legislative institution. (Oluoch, supra.) However, the ultimate decision as to when the Parliament will assume legislative functions, if it does so, and its legislative jurisdiction lies with the Assembly (composed of the heads of State and government of the African Economic Community (AEC)), and it will require an amendment to the Protocol approved by at least a two-thirds majority of the Assembly. (Protocol, supra, arts. 3, 11, & 24.)\n\nThe objectives of the Parliament, both in its current status as an advisory body and after it assumes legislative functions, include:\n\n\u00b7 facilitating the effective implementation of the policies and objectives of the OAU [Organization of African Unity, the predecessor of the AU]\/AEC and, ultimately, of the AU;\n\n\u00b7 promoting the principles of human rights and democracy in Africa;\n\n\u00b7 encouraging good governance, transparency, and accountability in Member States;\n\n\u00b7 familiarizing the peoples of Africa with the objectives and policies aimed at integrating the African continent within the framework of the establishment of the African Union;\n\n\u00b7 promoting peace, security and stability;\n\n\u00b7 contributing to a more prosperous future for the peoples of Africa by promoting collective self-reliance and economic recovery;\n\n\u00b7 facilitating cooperation and development in Africa;\n\n\u00b7 strengthening Continental solidarity and building a sense of common destiny among the peoples of Africa; and\n\n\u00b7 facilitating cooperation among regional economic communities and their Parliamentary fora. (Id. art. 3.)\n\nEach member state is represented in the Parliament by five parliamentarians reflecting the diversity of political opinions in its national legislative body. At least one of the representatives is required to be a woman.
