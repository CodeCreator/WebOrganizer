Adding to the company\u2019s existing IP200UHD family of products, the IP250UHD-TX transmitter and IP250UHD-RX video scaling receiver distribute ultra HD and 4K video with HDCP 2.2 over a single category or fiber cable. It also allows integrators to input two audio channels from the video-over-IP system for playout on Dante-enabled devices and extract two channels from the Dante network for playout across the Blustream system.\n\nThe IP250UHD video-over-IP platform distributes AV and control signals over a 1Gb network using visually lossless compression technology to deliver HDMI, Dante, bidirectional IR, RS-232 and USB\/KVM signals up to 328 feet over a standard network architecture. Distribution can travel further when using the units\u2019 fiber SFP port. The IP250UHD-TX and IP250UHD-RX support independent or combined HDMI and\/or Dante signal distribution to work with any network configuration. The IP250UHD-TX includes an HDMI loop-out for integrating local displays or cascading to multiple devices.\n\nBoth the transmitter and receiver can be powered via PoE from the network switch or locally should the switch not support PoE.",

        "text":"Home > News content\n\nThe new MBA uses Intel 7W Y Amber Lake processor.\n\nvia:\u5a01\u950b\u7f51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 time:2018\/10\/31 20:41:29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 readed:341\n\nIt is well known that Apple has always been reluctant to disclose the specific model of the processor when it releases new Mac hardware. Apple's release of the 2018 MacBook Air on October 30 followed this trend. However, looking at the processor specifications of Intel's ARK database, this ultra-light, thin notebook computer should be using Intel's Y series of low-power processors not long ago.\n\nLooking at Apple's official Web site specifications for a new generation of MacBook Aires, we can see that it carries an Intel dual-core Core i5 processor with a 1.6GHz main frequency, and the rest of the data includes Turbo Boost Rui-frequency up to 3.6GHz with a 4MB three-level cache. At the same time, the chip is integrated with ntel UHD Graphics 617 GPU, which supports 16GB memory with 2133MHz main frequency.\n\nThese data are then compared with Intel's new APK product database, the latest low-power, eighth-generation Core Y-series Amber Lake. It is not difficult to find that the processor model corresponding to these specifications is Intel Core i5-8210Y.\n\nInterestingly, the new Amber Lake processors previously announced include Core m3-8100Y, Core i5-8200Y, and Core i7-8500Y, all made in a 14 nm process, but all consumed 5W of TDP thermal design power. However, Intel's newly updated Cori5-8210Y processor, just after Apple's announcement, was a 7W thermal design power consumption, suggesting that the average power consumption when running at base frequencies under high-complexity workloads is higher, simply speaking, the performance that can be achieved is higher than 5W.\n\nPreviously, the MacBook Air had been using a 15W thermal-designed power processor, and this time it was supposed to go directly to Intel's latest U-Series Whiskey Lake processor, only to find out that the Y-Series Amber Lake chip was actually used for the MacBook. To be honest, this is a major shift in the MacBook Air product line, but it could also upset many MacBook Air fans who are in demand of performance.\n\nAs AnandTech, the industry's leading authority, points out, Apple's choice of lower-end Y-series Amber Lake platform chips is equivalent to trading energy efficiency for performance potential.\n\nHowever, the new generation of MacBook Aires has not improved significantly compared with the older generation. Wi-Fi browsing lasts up to 12 hours, the same as 30 days of standby time. Only iTunes movies have been upgraded by an hour to 13 hours. However, this has to do with batteries and screens, the new MacBook Air lithium-polymer battery has shrunk from 54 to 50.3 watt-hours, and the screen has been upgraded to a higher Retina retinal resolution.\n\nMany netizens believe Apple's downgrading of the MacBook Air processor from the Intel U-Series to the Y-Series seems to indicate that Apple might have planned to cut off the MacBook Air line because the latest model does look more like a 13-inch, higher-end MacBook, despite the Force Touch touch. Boards and Touch ID fingerprints, but this is more like a conventional upgrade, after all, a new technology will continue to be on the lower end of the line after a while, otherwise the new MacBook Air will not look so attractive.\n\nIn any case, Intel's latest batch of eighth-generation low-power chips, whether U-Series Whiskey Lake or Y-Series Amber Lake processors, are not officially suited to Apple's Mac products.\n\nFirst of all, these two series of chips do not support the latest DDR4L or LPDDR4 ultra low power memory. Moreover, Intel's advocacy of Amber Lake, which focuses on improving touch and handwriting interaction experiences, aims to optimize the 2-in-1 device, claiming that using touch pen composition, darkening shadows and coloring can be more accurate, has little to do with the MacBook Air on the Mac platform.\n\nOf course, Amber Lake chips have some new features to look at, such as Intel's statement that laptops or 2 \/ 1 tablets based on Amber Lake processors can be limited to 7mm in thickness and weigh no more than a pound. Greatly improve portability. Support for gigabit Wi-Fi is the second bright spot. On the other hand, if collocated Intel own Gigabit LTE modem also supports eSIM function. However, the new MacBook Air will not be based on Intel reference to design.\n\nChina IT News APP\n\nDownload China IT News APP\n\nPlease rate this news\n\nThe average score will be displayed after you score.\n\nPost comment\n\nDo not see clearly?

After tracking the responses and comparing each of the four devices, the firm found that 20% of the posts discussing the iPhone 5 were complaints. This compares to 18% of posts that complained about the BlackBerry Z10 and 15% that griped about Nokia\u2019s Lumia 920. Just 11% of posts covering the Galaxy S4 were complaints, leading\u00a0We Are Social to conclude that Samsung\u2019s flagship phone is the \u201cmost loved\u201d handset on the market.\n\nAmong the top complaints surrounding Apple\u2019s iPhone 5 launch were the phone\u2019s lack of innovation, its switch from the old 30-pin dock connector to the new lightning port, the poor quality of photos captured on some new iPhones, the black and slate model\u2019s\u00a0tendency\u00a0to scuff and the handset\u2019s terrible new Maps app.\n\nWe Are Social also notes that the iPhone 5 was by far the most talked about smartphone launch. The firm logged 1.7 million social media conversations immediately following the iPhone 5\u2019s debut compared to\u00a0300,000 mentions of BlackBerry\u2019s Z10, 140,000 Galaxy S4 mentions and just 45,000 posts discussing the Lumia 920.\n\n\nView Comments",
