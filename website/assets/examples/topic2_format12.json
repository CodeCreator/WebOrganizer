Look for the suite number on the door.\n\n\nOWASP Phoenix invites you to it's FEBRUARY meeting!\n\nTues FEB 2nd at 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM with a social\/happy hour at Taste of Top's afterwards. The meetings are always free, unfortunately the drinks afterward aren't.\n\nThe meetings are now being generously hosted by ExecuTrain and QuietMove, at Executrain's training facility.\n\nThis month's meeting:\n\n  \u2022 Introduction, chapter business. web application security news update by Adam Muntner, Managing Partner, QuietMove Inc. and Phoenix OWASP Chapter Lead\n  \u2022 Discussion: TBD\n\nThe location is: Executrain 3600 E University Dr # A1400 Phoenix, AZ 85034 The entrance is on the West side of the building. Look for the suite number on the door.\n\n2010 Meetings Calendar\n\nThis calendar will likely be updated on month to month basis. In absence of a speaker for a monthly meeting we will opt for a short discussion.\n\n  \u2022 March 2, Meeting potentially cancelled due to timing with the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco\n  \u2022 April 6, \"Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors: How to Secure Your Business Critical Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors & Data\" Mr. Jill Naymie, Veracode\n    \u2022 With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries, it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and security of the software running its business critical applications. As a result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the prevalent attack vector used by hackers.\n    \u2022 Whether you manage internal development activities, work with third party developers or are developing a COTS application for enterprise, your mandate is clear- safeguard your code and make applications security a priority for internal and external development teams.\n    \u2022 In this session we will cover:\n      \u2022 Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks\n      \u2022 Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on your applications\n      \u2022 Methods to identify, track and remediate these vulnerabilities\n\n\n\nArchived pages on Phoenix\/Tools and Phoenix\/ToolsProfile\n\nThis chapter is dedicated to bringing together local businesses, students, and web and security enthusiasts in order to discuss current events, trends, tools, and offensive\/defensive techniques related to web application security. We currently hold meetings every month, typically with one or two speakers at each meeting.\n\nWhat talks would you like to see?\n\nPlease Update\n\n  \u2022 Certificates\n  \u2022 Application Firewalls\n  \u2022 PHP\n  \u2022 Security ROI\n  \u2022 Penetration Testing Methods\n  \u2022 AJAX\n  \u2022 Cryptography in Web Applications\n  \u2022 Reversing ActiveX controls\n  \u2022 Using Local Proxies\n  \u2022 Browser Safety \/ Security\n  \u2022 Web services security: XML\/SOAP\/WSDL\n\n\nPrevious Meetings\n\nApplication Security Tools\nA Scanner Sparkly - Web Application Proxy Editors and Scanners - Andre Gironda\nGray Box Assessment Lessons Learned - Adam Muntner\nRisk Assessment Considerations for Web Applications (brief talk+discussion) - Erich Newell\n\nReflections on Trusting the Same-Origin Policy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and other web+network trust issues \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Andre Gironda\n\nIn computing, the same origin policy is an important security measure for client-side scripting (mostly Javascript). It prevents a document or script loaded from one \"origin\" from getting or setting properties of a document from a different \"origin\". It was designed to protect browsers from executing code from external websites, which could be malicious.\n\nXSS and CSRF vulnerabilities exploit trust shared between a user and a website by circumventing the same-domain policy. DNS Pinning didn't pan out exactly right, either. Can client-side scripting allow malicious code to get into your browser history and cache? Can it enumerate what plugins you have installed in your browser, or even programs you have installed to your computer? Can it access and modify files on your local hard drive or other connected filesystems? Can client-side scripts be used to access and control everything you access online? Can it be used to scan and attack your Intranet \/ local network? Does an attacker have to target you in order to pull off one of these attacks successfully? If I turn off Javascript or use NoScript, am I safe? What other trust relationships does the web application n-Tier model break?\n\nData@Risk \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Protecting Web Applications Throughout the Development Lifecycle from Hackers - Brian Christian\n\nBrian Christian, Co-founder and Application Security Engineer, S.P.I. Dynamics, Inc. discussed what Web application security is and why it is needed throughout the entire development lifecycle. We will discuss common vulnerabilities in the Web application layer and why they are so easily exploited. This session demonstrates how to defend against common attacks at the Web application layer with examples covering Web application hacking methods such as SQL Injection, Blind SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Parameter Manipulation, etc. We will also review how compliance and regulatory legislation such as PCI, GLBA, HIPAA, CASB 1386, and Sarbanes-Oxley, etc. specifically relates to and affects Web application security. Additionally, we will examine how security throughout the development lifecycle is essential to the security of Web application code and the protection of proprietary data.\n\nWeb Application 0-Day \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Jon Rose\n\nLearn about how to identify, exploit, and remediate some of the most common security vulnerabilities in web applications. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be using real-world examples in a dynamic, fun, and open discussion using publicly available source code.\n\nDiscovering Web Application Vulnerabilities with Google CodeSearch\n\nBuilding Application Security into the SDLC - Adam Muntner\n\nAdam will share his experiences about how organizations can integrate application security into all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle, from the creation of functional specifications all the way through deployment, maintenance, and updates. He will explain how to \"bake security in\" rather than \"ice it on.\"",

        "text":"Registered 2006-07-02 by Ramon Diaz-Uriarte\nAsterias is a set of web-based applications for the analysis of genomic and proteomic data. Asterias combines Python with R and C\/C++, using MPI for parallelization, and aspires to become a standard for high-performance, distributed, web-based bioinformatics and biostatistics applications.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Gene expression data normalization, preprocessing, and imputation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Analysis of differential gene expression\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Search for molecular signatures, with survival and (planned) class data.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Search for class prediction and survival prediction models using gene\/protein expression data.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* (planned) Analysis of tissue array data.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Analisys of aCGH data including calling gains and losses, estimating copy number changes, and (planned) joint analysis of aCGH and expression data.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Functional annotation of analyses results.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Distributed computing using MPI, (planned) UPC and (planned) Grid.\n\n\nAsterias is fully functional. It is working and publicly available from the main Asterias site. Some of the tools have been running since September 2005 and the latest tools have been publicly accessible since January 2006. During the month of May 2006 Asterias had about 300 hundred usages (these are true usage counts, not webalizer hits), excluding IDConverter, which itself had about 1100 usages during this period.\n\n\nAll of Asterias developers are, as of today, from the Statistical Computing Team at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center. (You can see names and links to individual developers from the specific applications). Expanding this list of developers depends on your joining the project!\n\nUsing Asterias:\n\nYou don't need to install anything. Just go to the application(s) that interest you.\n\nInstalling Asterias:\n\nThe code is available for download. Right now, except for the R packages, installing the rest of the code still involves a fair amount of manual work, like changing IPs, LAM\/MPI settings, etc. The Pylons installer should make that easier, once it is fully functional. You will, for now, definitely need something like the files provided in \"Asterias Common\", and then whichever applications you are interested in. Some additional information is provided here:\n\nDownloading Asterias:\n\nWe use Bazaar for version control. To get the code of, say, genesrf do (after installing Bazaar):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0bzr get\n\n(in same cases you might also do:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0bzr get\n\nor, if you want to download from\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0bzr get\n\nYou get the idea. If you want another application, just change the corresponding name. (All two --or three, if bnf exists--- should give you the exact same thing; but we've had problems with firewalls and some server's downtime; so if one of the options doesn't work, try the other).\n\n\nThe \"standard\" R packages (ADaCGH, varSelRF, RJaCGH) have the usual documentation for R packages and some might also have vignettes. For the web-based applications there is the online help, which you can access from the application, and which you also get in full if you download the code. All applications have commented examples, etc, illustrating several features.\n\nA few papers have been published describing some of the applications.
