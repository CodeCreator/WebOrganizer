It\u2019s bad on so many levels, and yet you can\u2019t look away (except, somewhat ironically, during the soft-porn parts). It might be a great exercise to focus on some scenes and try to figure out what went wrong there. Just bad acting? Weird choices in the editing room? Some profound, but honest misunderstanding of the rules of cinema-making?\n\nThis is a movie that\u2019s ultimately logic-agnostic, but maybe in some other universe where logic operates differently it\u2019d be a masterpiece?\n\nGreat stuff. Again, watch with good friends or don\u2019t watch at all.",

        "text":"Tiny Moving Parts \u2013 Swell\n\na2334147848_10Band: Tiny Moving Parts\nAlbum: Swell\nLabel: Big Scary Monsters\nRelease date: January 2018\nSounds like: Sending applause to your heartstrings. A rapid detachment.\n\n\u201cScan an open road, distort the traffic\/Never getting used to these second guesses\u2026\u201d\n\nDue to mishearing lyrics, I thought that on Malfunction, track 8 from the new Tiny Moving Parts album, Swell, vocalist Dylan Mattheisen said \u201cI got dizzy right before the vapid detachments.\u201d I thought \u201chell, that\u2019s a terrific band name, The Vapid Detachments*!\u201d However, I\u2019m reliably informed that the word is rapid, which is still decent, if not better? Probably?\n\nTiny Moving Parts then, completed by the brothers Chevalier (Matt on bass, Billy on drums) are back with the follow up to 2016\u2019s Celebrate and their second release through the Big Scary Monsters imprint. It\u2019s quite an impressive move by BSM main man, Kevin to sign these dudes a few years back \u2013 they tick a lot of boxes and overlap into several others. Twiddly-math-emo styles? Check. Huge punk rock choruses that feel like a bone-crunching hug of joy? You betcha. An impassioned and earnest vocal lead that makes your heart\u2026er\u2026swell? Thumbs up.\n\nOpening track Applause, asks for veritable ovation be sent to your heartstrings. There\u2019s an edge of darkness in this though, whilst the twinkling guitars, math-punk riffs, scattered percussion and plethora of tambourines litter this, Mattheisen\u2019s cries of \u201cI want to give up\u201d\u00a0and the line \u201cstruggle with every single breath\u201d seem to hold some desire to overcome and breakthrough a period of sadness. Luckily, the cry of \u201capplause my lungs still breathing\u201d on every single one of this song\u2019s damn hook-laden choruses makes the glass seem half-full.\n\nBuilding bridges is the topic of the soaring Smooth It Out \u2013 a track that seems to be about improving a relationship, talk of missteps and \u201csmoke breaks\u201d (taking time out) and offering to be the \u201cweight on your shoulders\u201d hey, it\u2019s about love everyone! Aw. Mattheisen and the Chevalier boys carve out a crackling slab of spirited up-tempo heartland rock, which bursts with even more vigour thanks to the rising background strings\/(keys?) and subtle gang-vocal melodies.\n\nThe jagged, punchy guitars on the aggravated Feel Alive, give the track a crisp, yet busy feel, whilst Mattheisen\u2019s breathless and erratic vocals compliment the title incredibly well (fella really does want to feel alive it seems). Bloody love the underused additional vocals from Kelc Galluzzo and her call-and-response of \u201cI still miss you.\u201d\u00a0Kind of makes me think of the additional vocals on High Speed from the Single Mothers album from last year; i.e. not used enough \u2013 more of this please.\n\nCaution could well be your favourite single of 2018 and we\u2019ve not even made it through February yet! That mathy-guitar 40 seconds in will do it, or even the massive chorus hook of \u201cI\u2019m still waiting\u2026FOR A SLIGHT BREAK!\u201d or maybe it\u2019s the brilliant video? Whatever it is, this is indeed, love.\n\nSomeday we\u2019re all going to die\u2026but not tonight!\u201d shouts Matthesien on the discordant but emo-rock-tastic Wildlife, showcasing how Tiny Moving Parts are striving to create huge fucking slogans to be shouted during their live shows, and all power to them for it. There\u2019s a jagged urgency to the stumbling and frantic Whale Watching, whilst the riff-laden scuzz of Malfunction sets a more aggressive tone, especially the lyrics, with cries of frost filling Matthesien\u2019s head and the repeated scream of \u201cit\u2019s a message\u201d\u00a0which you can see hordes of fans at their shows bellowing back at the band \u2013 superb. Warm Hand Splash starts with an apology and launches headfirst into regret. Should we be happy? It asks for forgiveness, and brims with venting and rending gusto and some lush horn sections adding to the punchy and flamboyant emotional conclusion. The Hotelier are probably taking notes.\n\nTiny Moving Parts couldn\u2019t have picked a better title for this collection of songs really. These 10 tracks on Swell are fit to burst with impassioned beauty, melancholy, tales of loss and re-connection; from their erratic time changes to the heady blasts of breakneck punk rock and contemplative, brooding lyrical couplets. Sure, it might be cheesy in places, but sometimes that\u2019s what you need in order to feel and care a little too much.\n\nYou can purchase Swell by absolute top lads Tiny Moving Parts from Big Scary Monsters.

        "text":"Matt Blackall | Foxy Digitalis\n\nKevin McEleney (aka Droughter) returns with another release under his Endless Time moniker. For \u201cPatience,\u201d he stretches two slabs of blasting electronics across a twenty-minute cassette. It\u2019s plenty noisy, but doesn\u2019t go much beyond that.\n\nThe A-side piece, \u201cThe Clock Ends,\u201d is full of bass-heavy electronic blats and buzzes with a few other sounds creeping in as the track unfolds. \u201cJust After Sunset,\u201d the B-side track kicks things into a higher frequency, pushing the bass of the first track into the background. It\u2019s a lot more abrasive too, with peals of electronic squall and distortion filling out the mix.\n\nIn the end, \u201cPatience\u201d offers up a few interesting blaps and bloops, but I can\u2019t say it was terribly memorable or exciting. For most of the tape, it comes across like listening to a set of blown speakers pushed into the red while someone twiddles with the stereo knobs.

        "text":"Back Comments (2) Share:\nFacebook Button\n\n\nWith the bank threatening to take Ty Hackett\u2019s (Columbus Short) house away, leaving him and his brother Jimmy (Andre Kinney) homeless and penniless, Ty is left with no choice but to take up the offer from friend and work colleague Mike Cochrane (Matt Dillon) when he asks Ty to play a part in an inside job at their security firm.\n\nWith forty-two million in their security vans, the plan is a simple one. Make it look like a robbery, hide the money, and wait. That is until they are spotted by a hapless hobo in the warehouse they\u2019re stashing the money in and panic turns into murder. Having a flash change of heart and taking refuge in one of the locked vans, Ty only needs to wait it out for fifty-eight minutes until they miss a phone check in and the cops come. However, the rest of his team have other plans and if they get to Ty, he\u2019s in trouble.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a remake? Surely this has to be a remake? This feels like a remake of a seventies movie that probably wasn\u2019t that good then and they\u2019ve not made it much better now. I mean, the premise is a sound one, one honest guy in amongst a group of rogues, holed up in a locked security while they try to bash their way in to get him and the last of the money. This could and should be full of tension, but really Armored plays a little too broad for its own good and the writer takes routes that are just plain ridiculous.\n\nOutside of the atrocious dialogue, which is so clunky it\u2019s unreal, and the numerous scenes of unbelievably badly handled twists and turns in the heist gone bad (Matt Dillion\u2019s attempt at lying to sheriff deputy Jake Eckehart (Milo Ventimiglia) is laughable. \u201cOh there\u2019s no siren in there. No, you don\u2019t want to go in there, erm, err an old dog crawled in there and died erm, err\u201d)\n\nThere are glimmers of really wanting Ty to succeed, thanks in large part to Columbus Short\u2019s likable leading man performance. However, it\u2019s the utter stupidity of the story that flatlines the credibility of movie. For starters the fake suspense is laughable. When the team go to pick up their massive money shipment, it\u2019s played like they've already done something wrong, which is ridiculous. At this stage they are just doing their jobs\u2014loading up their van with money. Why is this being played like they have fake ID or are conning someone? This is actually their job. Even more so the amount of times Ty manages to get out of the van only to go back into again for no real reason is absolute insanity. I could swallow it the first time. He saved a cop (though getting back in the van seemed a lesser option to taking the cop out of the building and hiding), but when he sneaks out, goes to the roof to call the cops only to sneak back in again (as opposed to leaving the building to get some more immediate help) Ty\u2019s decision making blew a hole in my caring about what happened next.\n\nArmored is utter junk food with more than its fair share of actors slumming it. Jean Reno brings nothing to the movie, Fishburne has never felt more like he was acting, I\u2019ve never understood how Matt Dillon manages to keep playing the same role time and time again. Really, Armored just ends up another one of those \u201cmeh\u201d big glossy movies that all look and feel the same and are about as shallow as kiddies\u2019 paddling pool.\n\n\nNow the movie might be watchable guff, but thanks to the fantastic transfer it\u2019s a pretty looking load of guff. From the get go the level of detail is apparent. Stubble, shaved heads, skin textures (Laurence Fishburne was born for HD) and even the small things like seeing that Matt Dillion\u2019s ear has been pierced are all shown off with the movies bright warm lighting and sharpness.\n\nThe night shots are deep black and the use of shadow to show Dillon\u2019s dark side is also captured well. There\u2019s next to no grain thanks to the bright midday setting of the whole movie and while the action scenes are few and far between, they are pretty well shot and look great in the HD presentation.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, there\u2019s really only a couple of action scenes and it\u2019s only in these that the DTS-HD Master Audio track comes alive and quite effectively. Beyond that, it\u2019s just a case of strong dialogue, with Fishburne\u2019s voice booming harder than the rest, especially with his heavy laugh and the clanging of metal as the team try desperately to hammer out the pins in the armoured van\u2019s hinges.\n\nThe odd gunshot ups the volume a little and the score can sometimes get quite dynamic throughout the speakers but really the track is doing a fairly standard job without having the opportunity to bring any bells and whistles.\n\n\nThe commentary featuring Producer Dan Farah, Skeet Urich and Milo Ventimiglia is laid back and fairly loose. There are a few good moments (usually unrelated to the actual movie), but the three keep up the pace throughout the movie, offering up small nuggets of fun movie making tales and taking comedy pops at some of actors (and themselves) on screen.\n\nAs well as the usual Sony Blu-ray live and MovieIQ features, we have \u2018Planning the Heist: \u00a0Making Of\u2019 (15:19 HD) which is pretty straight forward stuff but gives a good insight from the writer James V. Simpson regarding his intentions with the story and Antal\u2019s approach to it.\n\n\u2018Armed and Underground: Production Design\u2019 (06:47 HD) looks at the abandoned factory setting as well as the lesser used locations and \u2019Crash Course: Stunts' (11:30 HD) focuses on the action moments of the movie.\n\nLastly there are trailers for \u2018 Blu-ray is High Definition\u2019, 2012 and Michael Jackson\u2019s This Is It.\n\n\n\nThis release is a fairly typical Sony affair, with a passable batch of features but a pretty great A\/V presentation. The movie itself is an okay watch once movie which I won\u2019t deny had the odd spike of guilty enjoyment. It\u2019s fairly well made and has a short enough run time not to outstay its welcome but it really misses the opportunity to take advantage of its strong cast and utterly failed to convince me why the hell Ty kept going back to that van.\n\n* Note: The above images are taken from the Blu-ray release and resized for the page.

        "text":"Published on January 17th, 2013 | by StandUpTalk\n\n\nShow Review \u2013 The Parlor \u2013 Host: Jay Davis\n\nJay Davis is the host every Monday at 9:30PM at the Parlor on Melrose for stand up comedy at its best. Davis gets top comics to perform each week as well as a packed house of young Hollywood types that are eager to drink and watch a good show. I\u2019ve seen Metta World Peace from the Lakers in the crowd and was elbow to elbow with Hollywood legend Penny Marshall. We were both in line to get in and both were trying to sneak in water bottles, I guess great minds think alike. They do serve water at the Parlor if you were wondering.\n\nThe comedy is high quality all the way through the show, which last about two hours. Big headliners are always performing as well as comedian seen on Chelsea Lately, Letterman, Leno, Ferguson and Conan. Davis has a lot of regular comics he likes to shuffle in the line up as well new comics to the show each week. It is also a hangout for many comics who come to watch fellow friends perform.\n\nThe Parlor is an upscale sports bar located on Melrose Ave. just west of LaBrea. It\u2019s a cool spot to watch comedy as it is a very intimate room. Usually, it is pretty crowded so there is couch seating on the side of the stage and behind the stage as well. There are big screen televisions behind the stage so you can still watch it if you are located on the couch. There is also a huge patio directly outside the comedy show where people hang and watch the televisions that show the comedy so you never have to miss any of the action. The food at the Parlor is awesome and table service is available throughout the show. Valet is available outside and if you\u2019re lucky , you may snag a meter spot on Melrose\u2026if you\u2019re lucky. Get there early if you want a good seat as they go fast, you can contact Jay Davis to reserve a table, a very good idea if you are coming with a group, don\u2019t be left out in the cold. Definitely a place to be seen, the Parlor is doing comedy the right way every Monday night.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n2 Responses to Show Review \u2013 The Parlor \u2013 Host: Jay Davis\n\n  1.
