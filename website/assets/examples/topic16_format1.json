        "text":"Social Icons\n\nTuesday, April 29, 2014\n\n\nFrom a New York Times bestselling author, a brand new sexy contemporary romance featuring military bad boys: A BEAUTIFUL DISTRACTION by Kelsie Leverich.\n\nNothing\u2019s more dangerous than a bad boy with a broken heart\u2026\n\nFirst Sergeant Rafe Murano did everything to the extreme. He trained harder, he fought harder, and unfortunately, he loved harder. But he fell for the wrong woman and it nearly destroyed him.\n\nBack home from a deployment, with no mission to consume him, Murano\u2019s ravaged by memories of his past. So he drinks until he\u2019s numb and drowns himself in meaningless one night stands. But they only take the edge off\u2026\n\nUntil he meets Fallon.\n\nFallon Kelly learned the hard way not to take risks with her heart, But she sees something\u3000 irresistible in the tatted-up bad boy one more punch away from a ride in the back of a squad car. She offers a distraction. And he quickly becomes an addiction.\u3000Little does she know, this bad boy could love so hard it could break her\u2026\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nKelsie Leverich\u00a0grew up in the small town of St. Joseph Illinois before getting married and following her\nhusband from one Army post to another.\u00a0 After eight years, they finally settled down in Avon, Indiana with two adorable knuckleheads that are better known as her kids.\u00a0\u00a0Kelsie's life revolves around her family (to include two dogs and a cat) and most of the time, actually all of the time, it\u2019s a crazy mess\u2014but that\u2019s the way she loves it!\u00a0 When Kelsie\u2019s not writing, you can usually find her snuggling on the couch with her kids and a good book or out on the lake with family and friends.\u00a0 Kelsie is not a morning person, has a soft spot for animals, loves musicals, hates seafood, and thinks laundry is the source of all evil.\n\nKelsie is currently working on the third book in her military series with editor\u00a0Danielle Perez\u00a0with NAL\/Penguin.\u00a0\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway\n\nMonday, April 28, 2014\n\nTO LOVE A HIGHLANDER by Sue-Ellen Welfonder blitz\n\nTO\u00a0LOVE\u00a0A\u00a0HIGHLANDER\u00a0(book I in the Scandalous Scots series)\nAs one of the bastards born to the Stirling court, Sorley the Hawk has never known his mother or father. It's a burning quest he has devoted himself to uncovering at any cost. But as a roguish warrior who serves at the pleasure of the King, his prowess-both on the battlefield and in his bedchamber-is legendary. So when a flame-haired Highland lass sneaks into his quarters with a tantalizing proposition, he can't resist taking her up on her offer . . .\u00a0\n\nLady Mirabelle MacLaren will do anything to keep from marrying her odious suitor, even sully her own good name. And who better to despoil her than his sworn enemy, the one they call \"Hawk?\" As they set about the enjoyable task of ruining her reputation, Hawk and Mirabelle soon learn that rebellion never tasted so sweet.\n\n\"We had a plan, an agreement.\" Mirabelle shifted on his lap, keenly aware of a certain hot ridge of hardness nudging the bottom of her thighs, burning her even through the layers of her skirts.\n\n\"Aye, we did.\" He took her face between his hands then, kissing her long and deep. When he pulled back, breaking the kiss, his eyes were darker than she\u2019d ever seen them, and he was breathing hard. \"I still have a plan, sweetness. And I hope I\u2019ll gain your agreement.\"\n\nMirabelle just looked at him, sure she hadn\u2019t heard rightly.\n\nBut she must\u2019ve, because all along the table, and even elsewhere on the dais, people were grinning, looking on with rapt interest.\n\nMirabelle ignored them, but she did frown. \"Our plan doesn\u2019t seem to have the affect I\u2019d desired.\"\n\nTo her surprise, Sorley grabbed her to him again and kissed her even more hungrily than before. It was a wild and heated open-mouthed kiss, full of breath, tongue, and hunger. He also thrust his fingers into her hair as he ravished her lips, holding her firmly to him, giving her no choice but to return the kiss with equal fervor.\n\nShe did so gladly, feeling bereft when he finally tore his mouth from hers. She hadn\u2019t wanted their kiss to end and the delicious tingles rippling through her left no doubt that she also wanted more.\n\nSure he could tell, she met his gaze, thrilled and excited, but also worried that her heart and not her good sense was guiding her.\n\n\"That was indeed better.\" It was all she could think to say. \"A most convincing display, for sure.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\" He leaned in, kissed the tip of her nose. \"Though my purpose has changed, or have you no\u2019 heard anything I\u2019ve said this e\u2019en?\"\n\nMirabelle blinked. \"I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Then I shall make it clearer.\" He cupped her face, slanting his mouth over hers again, his tongue thrusting sure and possessively.\n\nShe melted beneath the onslaught, gripped his shoulders to keep from sliding off his lap. The he pulled back, breaking the kiss as swiftly as he\u2019d seized her. But he kept hold of her face, looked deep into her eyes. Clearly stirred, his chest rose and fell, heavily. And his gaze wasn\u2019t just piercing, but blazed with something that made everything else around them fade to nothingness, as if they were alone in the hall, perhaps all the world.\n\n\"This isnae a planned seduction, Mirabelle,\" he spoke her name as if it held gold. The rough softness of his tone weakened her knees.\n\nThe look on his face\u2026.\n\nHer eyes started burning again just seeing the adoration there. The other more fierce expression that she didn\u2019t dare hope to decipher.\n\n\"No deliberate attempt to scandalize you.\" He leaned close to say that, lowering his voice so no one else would hear. \"A man doesnae bring shame to the woman he loves.\"\nAbout\u00a0Sue-Ellen\u00a0Welfonder\nSue-Ellen\u00a0Welfonder\u00a0is a Scotophile whose burning wish to make frequent trips to the land of her dreams led her to a twenty-year career with the airlines. Now a full-time writer, she's quick to admit that she much prefers wielding a pen to pushing tea and coffee. She makes annual visits to\u00a0Scotland, insisting they are a necessity, as each trip gives her inspiration for new books. Proud of her own Hebridean ancestry, she belongs to two clan societies: the MacFie Clan Society and the Clan MacAlpine Society. In addition to\u00a0Scotland, her greatest passions are medieval history, the paranormal, and dogs. She never watches television, loves haggis, and writes at a 450-year-old desk that once stood in a Bavarian castle.\u00a0Sue-Ellen\u00a0is married and currently resides with her husband and Jack Russell terrier in\u00a0Florida.\u00a0\n\nSue-Ellen\u2019s social media:\n\nBuy Links:\nAmazon \u2013\nBarnes & Noble \u2013\n\nNEVER ENTICE AN EARL by Lily Dalton Blitz\n\nNEVER\u00a0ENTICE\u00a0AN\u00a0EARL\u00a0(book II in the One Scandalous Season series)\nA Deception Most Reckless\nLady Daphne Bevington would do anything for her maid Kate-including masquerading as Kate and sneaking around the wrong side of London to settle the poor girl's debt. Yet her innocent ruse takes a scandalous turn when \"Kate\" runs into a handsome gentleman on a secret quest of his own. A moment of passion could cost Daphne her reputation, but how can she ignore the stranger's searing kiss?\n\nAn Arrangement Most Wicked\nLord Cormack Northmore is determined to find the immoral peer who ruined his sister. So when he learns that the irresistible woman he knows as \"Kate\" is the Season's most sought-after debutante, Cormack plans to use her connections to help him set a trap. Now, the closer Cormack gets to uncovering the villain who haunts the\u00a0ton's ballrooms, the more he realizes that the lovely lady is in danger herself. Will he abandon his quest for revenge-or risk losing his one chance at love?\n\n\nThe heat in his gaze intensified. He leaned toward her, his handsome face commanding her full\nattention. \"So tell me, Kate, in addition to being a dancer to pay off this debt, and not a very talented one at that, did you also entertain patrons?\"\n\n\"Entertain?\" She blinked, flustered by his proximity, and his overwhelming maleness. Had he truly said she was not a good dancer? And wait\u2026 he had said patrons. She frowned. \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\nCertainly he did not believe\u2026well, she supposed he might, given the sordid circumstances in which he\u2019d found her.\n\nOne dark eyebrow lifted. \"The Blue Swan is a brothel.\"\n\n\"Never,\" she blurted, heat rising to scald her cheeks. \"This was my first night ever to go to that place, and it was not at all what I\u2019d expected.\" She spoke the truth now. Not all her words were lies. \"All I had was the address on a scrap of paper, and instructions that I would be a model in the tableaux.\"\n\nA sudden fear came over her, a dreadful worry that in her naivety she\u2019d misjudged the stranger beside, that he wasn\u2019t a gentleman, but instead just like the others who had crowded against the stage, mindless with lust. He could easily overpower her, and satisfy whatever male urges he wished.\n\nBut he did not. He instead eased back into the seat until shadows obscured his countenance, all but his sensual lips, which pursed and frowned. She sighed with relief\n\n\"Good.\" He nodded. Below his breath, he muttered, \"Yes, good\u2026I suppose.\"\n\nHe conveyed a mixed message, one of approval but also disappointment. What if she\u2019d answered yes? Would he have sought to make use of her services? All the wicked things Sophia had described came to her in a vivid rush. Her mind entertained a fleeting fantasy, one of tangled sheets, muscled limbs and bare skin.\n\nThe very idea of being intimate with a stranger, with this stranger\n\nShe exhaled, bemused.\n\n--was not as appalling as it ought to be.\n\nPerhaps it was the graveness in his eyes, above lips that she suspected always carried some semblance of a smile that made her heart contract and her blood run hot.\n\nHe really was nonpareil. No man in her social circle compared, but that was because he obviously wasn\u2019t a nobleman. No nobleman would travel about London in a shabby, half-destroyed carriage nor converse on such familiar terms with their driver.\n\n\"Who are you, Cormack?\" she asked.\n\n\"Just\u2026a man.\"\n\n\"Are you a newspaperman? A store owner, or a sea captain? Please tell me, I want to know.... (truncated)",
