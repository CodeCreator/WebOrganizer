        "text":"CVS bans cigarettes, but will others\u00a0follow?\n\nThis is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) \u2013 CVS Caremark says it hopes it is \u201csetting an example\u201d by declaring that it will stop selling cigarettes at its more than 7,600 retail pharmacies. Whether the move will have an impact on other retailers remains an open question.\n\nCVS announced Wednesday that it will be the first major pharmacy chain to take the products off its shelves.\n\nThe company said the move makes sense. CVS (CVS, Fortune 500) estimates it will lose about $2 billion in annual revenues. That is a fraction of its overall business, which is also increasingly providing health care services like walk-in clinics and prescription drug coverage.\n\nCVS took in nearly $94 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2013, up slightly from the same period in 2012, according to its most recent filing. In 2012, it reported $123 billion in revenues, a 15% jump from the previous year.\n\nOne of CVS\u2019 main competitors, Walgreens (WAG, Fortune 500), which also operates the Duane Reade chain, said only that it has been evaluating its sale of tobacco products \u201cfor some time\u201d and will continue to do so.\n\nAnd Rite-Aid said it \u201ccontinually\u201d looks at whether its offerings meet \u201cthe needs and interests of its customers.\u201d Both chains noted that they offer products aimed at helping people stop smoking.\n\nThe CVS move could boost cigarette sales at other outlets, analysts said.\n\nTwo big discount retailers, Dollar General (DG, Fortune 500) and Family Dollar, (FDO, Fortune 500) have both recently added tobacco products to their shelves.\n\nIn December, Dollar General said that selling cigarettes and other products had helped drive in-store traffic and boost overall sales in the third quarter.\n\nAccording to 2011 stats from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 43.8 million people, or 19% of all adults, smoke cigarettes. The agency noted a \u201cslight overall decline\u201d between 2005 and 2011. It said more than 293 billion cigarettes were purchased nationwide that year.\n\nThe medical community and anti-smoking advocates have successfully lobbied for laws in a number of cities, including San Francisco and Boston, banning tobacco sales by pharmacies.\n\n\u201cWe think that the CVS announcement sends a powerful message that if you\u2019re in the business of health care you shouldn\u2019t be in the business of selling tobacco products,\u201d said Vince Willmore, spokesman for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n\nStill, customers have plenty of other outlets. According to consumer research firm EuroMonitor International, 3.6% of all cigarette sales in the United States are made in drug stores and nearly half occur at stores associated with gas stations. Another 16% of sales are at stand-alone convenience stores like a 7-Eleven.\n\nFor retailers, tobacco products typically have far lower profit margins than other items, such as prepared foods or beverages. But they help drive store traffic, industry analysts say.\n\nOn average, tobacco products account for 40% of sales at stand-alone and gas station convenience stores, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. Yet tobacco products make up only 21% of profits.\n\nAnti-smoking advocates remain hopeful the CVS decision will spark a ripple effect.\n\n\u201cWe hope it will encourage other retailers to decide whether a responsible company should be selling a uniquely lethal product like tobacco,\u201d Willmore said.\n\n-CNNMoney\u2019s Aaron Smith and CNN\u2019s Amanda Hobor contributed to this report.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2014 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Before long the girls were pleading with us to visit each other\u2019s hospital rooms to play.\n\n\u201cWhat they were going through was horrible, but at least they each had a friend who was facing the same thing.\n\n\u201cWhen Evie\u2019s hair began to come out in clumps I asked her if it would be okay to shave it and she said yes. No mum wants to have to do that for their little girl.\n\n\u201cI had a lump in my throat when she turned round smiling at the end and said \u2018look mummy, now I\u2019m just like all the other boys and girls in hospital\u2019.\n\n\u201cI know that part was hard on my husband too.\u201d\n\nShe and her 35-year-old farmer husband celebrated when told Evie was cancer-free in December.\n\nBoth girls are now looking forward to starting school in August, Ava at Kirkshaws Primary in Coatbridge and Evie at Milton Primary in Lesmahagow.\n\nDespite living miles apart, the two little Race for Life starters will remain firm pals - Friends for Life, in fact.",

In sub-Saharan countries with high HIV prevalence, one in four pregnancy-related deaths can be attributed to HIV. The study authors based their conclusions on a systematic review of 23 studies that had collected data on the risk of pregnancy-related death among uninfected and HIV-infected women.\n\nMany of the 23 studies were conducted in areas of the world where a \"verbal autopsy\" from family members is the most common form of death report. Most of the HIV-infected women in the 23 studies were not taking antiretroviral therapy and were in an \"advanced stage\" of the disease. Little is known about the effects of HIV on pregnancy; it is not clear whether HIV causes more complications for pregnant women or whether pregnancy triggers the HIV progression.\n\nThe review compared death during pregnancy and the postpartum period among HIV-infected women and uninfected women to calculate the relative risk of death and the prevalence of HIV, and then used the pooled relative risk data from the meta-analysis to predict the effect of HIV on pregnancy-related death at the population level. This calculation method removes assumptions about HIV being related to or coincidental to pregnancy. Severe anemia and TB can cause maternal death and HIV-related death indirectly. Study authors suggest that future studies focus on identifying HIV-related deaths from \"verbal autopsies.\"\n\nPrevious estimates of pregnancy-related death among HIV-infected women were not based on empirical data and did not distinguish between pregnancy-related deaths and maternal death that was incidental to the pregnancy.\n\nThe full report, \"The Contribution of HIV to Pregnancy-Related Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,\" was published online in the journal AIDS (2013; doi: 10.1097\/qad.0b013e32835fd940).\n\nBack to other news for April 2013\n\nAdapted from:\n04.09.2013; Carole Leach-Lemens\n\nThis article was provided by CDC National Prevention Information Network.

        "text":"September 24, 2012\n\nAn employee works on a sample analysis in a high-security\nlab (AFP Photo \/ Nicolas Tucat)\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) officials are on alert after two confirmed cases and one suspected case of a new virus from the same family as SARS appeared in Saudi Arabia last week. Doctors are watching for any sign the disease may spread.\n\nThe cases involve a coronavirus (named for the corona, or halo, visible around the virus under a microscope) that causes severe pneumonia and kidney failure in patients. One of the confirmed cases is a 49 year-old man in intensive care in a London hospital after being evacuated by air-ambulance to Britain from Qatar on September 11.\n\nThe other two confirmed cases have already died.\n\nDr. Ali Mohamed Zaki first revealed that a new coronavirus had been discovered last week in a 60-year-old man at the Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on the ProMED-mail website, a site used to monitor infectious diseases around the globe. In the post, Zaki noted that the coronavirus was similar to those found in bats.\n\nThe most famous coronavirus was the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that killed about 916 and infected 8,422 worldwide. The potential threat of this particular coronavirus is not yet known, but World Health Organization (WHO) officials are monitoring the situation.\n\n\u201cGiven that this is a novel coronavirus, WHO is currently in the process of obtaining further information to determine the public health implications of these two confirmed cases,\u201d the WHO said in a statement.\n\nThe discovery of the new virus comes at a potentially hazardous time; on the eve of the Hajj, the Islamic holy pilgrimage to the city of Mecca. Saudi Arabia opened its borders to pilgrims on September 17, but the real influx of pilgrims is set for the end of October. Last year, almost 2 million Muslims from around the world completed the rite.\n\nWHO officials are not imposing any travel restrictions at the moment, despite the potential for the new virus to go global.\n\nThe Health Protection Agency (HPA) in the United Kingdom also weighed in on the matter.\n\n\u201cThe HPA is providing advice to healthcare workers to ensure the patient under investigation is being treated appropriately. In the light of the severity of the illness that has been identified in the two confirmed cases, immediate steps have been taken to ensure that people who have been in contact with the UK case have not been infected, and there is no evidence to suggest that they have,\u201d Professor John Watson, said in a statement.\n\nWhile urging vigilance, Professor Watson also echoed the WHO, saying there was no reason for any travel advisories, no specific precautions to take, and the ultimate reach and contagiousness of the virus has yet to be determined.\n\nThis article first appeared on RT.com.\n\nRelated Articles",

Within weeks of the birth she started a gruelling course of chemotherapy.\n\nRebecca, who lives with husband Kevin, 27, a visiting officer for Durham County Council, believes Layla is the reason why she is still alive today.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe only reason I went to the doctors was because I was pregnant. We often put things off but because I was pregnant I knew I needed to get things checked out. Layla is probably the reason I\u2019m still here.\u201d Rebecca was given chemotherapy every fortnight for six months but finished her treatment in December 2011.\n\nShe has now returned to work and is enjoying quality time with her daughter.\n\nShe said: \u201cI have come a long way in such a short space of time and I had to make sure I was OK for the little one.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s come on so much and she is just a typical two-year-old who is into everything.\n\n\u201cEveryday I look at her and think \u2018she saved my life\u2019.
