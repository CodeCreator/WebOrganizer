        "text":"Even when you banish a creek from view, it has a way of making its presence known.\n\nSan Francisco's Islais Creek is mostly out of sight - running through an underground culvert except for a stretch in Glen Park and its bay outfall at Third Street. That's the creek that runs under Balboa High School, where it occasionally floods the cafeteria, and the Alemany Housing Project, also reportedly subject to wet spells.\n\nBonnie Ora Sherk is among those who'd rather try to keep it in mind even when it's not in sight.\n\nLast week we described Sherk's involvement with the San Miguel Child Development Center on Seneca Avenue, where native trees have redeemed a sterile cityscape and a school garden has become what the local artist and landscape architect calls the OMI (Oceanview-Merced-Ingleside)\/Excelsior Living Library and Think Park. The garden's lively student-designed mosaic murals depict, among many other things, historic Islais Creek.\n\n\"Water from Islais Creek was once the most valuable water in San Francisco,\" Sherk told us last month. \"It was used after the 1906 earthquake. It feeds down from San Bruno Mountain through the Cayuga Valley. Then two forks join and go out to the Islais Channel at Third Street.\" The Islais Creek watershed is the city's largest, linking nine neighborhoods as disparate as Noe Valley and Bayview.\n\n\nNow Playing:\n  \u2022 Now Playing\n    Diver Lays On Sea Floor While Sharks Swim Above Storyful\n  \u2022 5 Royal Bachelors You Need to Meet Now That Prince Harry Is Taken TaLTIME\n  \u2022 Vlogger Tries Chinese Street Food Cuisine of Sand Worms Storyful\n  \u2022 This Christmas, Serve Cranberry-Orange Shots in Cute Clementine Cups CountryLiving\n  \u2022 The Ladies Of Point Of Grace Cherish The Bonds Of Sisterhood SLivingTime\n  \u2022 Pig and Pup Pals Snuggle Together for a Snooze Storyful\n  \u2022 How to Make Pickled Shrimp HealthTime\n  \u2022 24 Hours with Sabrina Carpenter | Harper's BAZAAR HarpersBazaar\n  \u2022 Food Diaries with Maye Musk HarpersBazaar\n  \u2022 JetBlue Is Selling a $20 Board Game That Comes With a Round-trip Flight TaLTIME\n\n\"Islais\" comes from \"slay',\" an American Indian name for the holly leaf cherries - shrubby trees with shiny tooth-edged evergreen leaves - that used to line its banks. Central and Southern California Indians processed the cherry pits into flour. The name first appeared on a Mexican map in 1834. The cherries still grow on San Bruno Mountain, but they're long gone from San Francisco.\n\nBy the 1850s, water from Islais Creek irrigated the produce gardens of the Bayview's Portuguese, Italian and Irish growers. It wasn't long, though, before the creek was befouled with offal and sewage from the slaughterhouses of Butchertown. People began to refer to it by the name of that proverbial creek that we have all been up, without a paddle. After 1906, much of Islais Creek was \"reclaimed\" with rubble from the quake.\n\nEven in its diminished state, the creek fires Sherk's imagination. \"This watershed won't leave me alone,\" she said. \"It turns out I've been working in the same watershed all these years.\" That work began with an urban farm and art center at Army Street and Potrero Avenue and evolved into the Living Libraries at San Miguel and at Junipero Serra Elementary School and Child Development Center near Holly Park.\n\nIts most recent extension is the Bernal Heights Nature Walk, framing the Islais watershed from the south slope of Bernal Heights to St. Mary's Park.\n\nSherk acknowledges that she is \"doing rehabilitation rather than restoration,\" looking for \"places where water can be liberated.\" She sees San Francisco's Better Streets Program as a chance to redefine and redesign the city's streets: \"I'd like to see Cesar Chavez Street redesigned as more serpentine to reflect the water underneath. There's no reason a street has to be straight. That's Cartesian old thinking. Solutions will become obvious - the place will tell us what it can be.\"\n\nFor now, her focus is on the living frame. In November at Holly Park, 200 Junipero Serra students helped plant native trees and shrubs: coast live oak, ceanothus 'Ray Hartman', flannelbush, buckeye, silktassel, toyon, redbud.\n\n\"The species were chosen for their colorful beauty,\" Sherk said, \"to dispel the common myth that natives are ugly.\" The planting is being funded by the California Department of Forestry; the Mayor's Office of Community Development and the San Francisco Foundation also provided financial support.\n\nWe visited the park last month, when neighborhood volunteers were assisting Recreation and Park Department crews with more plantings. Rec and Park's John Miller, in charge of Holly Park, stopped by. \"Sometimes Bonnie reminds me of Julia Morgan and I'm William Randolph Hearst,\" Miller joked.\n\nMore oaks and other drought-tolerant trees will go in around the Alemany project and College Hill Reservoir. St. Mary's Park will get a riparian mix of species, including Islais Creek's namesake holly leaf cherries. The goal is to have 500 trees in the ground by March.\n\nSherk sees art as another key component of the Nature Walk: \"On Oneida Street we have giant polychrome wooden cutouts of students' leaf and flower drawings. There are opportunities for creating narrative artworks - murals and sculptures - that will celebrate local ecologies, histories and cultures.\"\n\nThe Nature Walk is not just one woman's crusade. The planting design evolved through a series of community meetings, and more are planned. \"In calling attention to the watershed,\" says Sherk, \"we have the opportunity to demonstrate the interconnectedness of these diverse communities.\" It's her way of recognizing the complex ecology of San Francisco, and the unacknowledged links among natural and human histories.\n\nIslais Creek history:www.sfnpc.org\/islaiscreekhistory\n\nA Living Library:www.alivinglibrary.org",

        "text":"10 Influential Azerbaijanis You Should Know\n\nHeydar Aliyev on a Russian stamp | \u00a9 Russian Post\/WikiCommons\nHeydar Aliyev on a Russian stamp | \u00a9 Russian Post\/WikiCommons\nPhoto of Sam Bedford\n9 February 2018\n\nAzerbaijan might not be on the global radar and at the forefront of our minds, but the nation gave birth to several influential Azerbaijanis who made worldwide contributions. Here are 10 of those people, including medieval poets, Soviet scientists, cosmonauts, and the intriguing man who lived to 168 years old.\n\nNizami Ganjavi (1141-1209)\n\nNizami Ganjavi is the most celebrated and revered Azerbaijani in history. Not only did the 12th-century poet produce some of Azerbaijan\u2019s finest literature, but his legacy also influenced global writing. Combining romanticism and realism, several lines of double rhyming verses creep into his masterpieces. The collection of five poems called the Khamsa are said to be his best. Nizami has such a legacy that roads bear his name, including Baku\u2019s Nizami Street. His elegant mausoleum lies on the outskirts of his hometown, Ganja.\n\nNizami Ganjavi, one of the most famous Azerbaijanis in history | \u00a9 Ganja Museum\/WikiCommons\n\nHeydar Aliyev (1923-2003)\n\nAzerbaijan\u2019s third president ruled from 1993 to 2003 and revolutionised modern Azerbaijan. After spending much of his life in the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, he eventually became leader after a political crisis threatened to bring the country to civil war. Heydar Aliyev later opened up the oil industry to international investment, which inspired the boom and funded Baku\u2019s development. The futuristic Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku honours the former leader.\n\nFormer President Heydar Aliyev | \u00a9 Pentagon.gov\/WikiCommons\n\nIlham Aliyev (1961-present)\n\nHeydar Aliyev\u2019s son, Ilham, became the fourth president of Azerbaijan in 2003. Despite criticism from the West, Illham has helped Azerbaijan progress into the 21st century. State reforms on culture, science, sports and healthcare as well as hosting sporting events are just a few of his progressive policies. Azerbaijan entered the Eurovision under Ilham in 2008, and the introduction of the eVisa makes the country more accessible to tourism today.\n\nAzerbaijan's current President | \u00a9 kremlin.ru\/WikiCommons\n\nAhmad Javad (1892-1937)\n\nAhmad had a fruitful career as a poet, author and activist who fought for Azerbaijan\u2019s independence in the early 20th century. With an impressive linguistic capacity (fluent in four languages) and famed for composing the National Anthem, Ahmad quickly became known as an influential Azerbaijani. The National Anthem was used after declaring independence as Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan (1918-1920) and again after independence was reinstated in 1991. He fell victim to Stalin\u2019s Purges where he later died.\n\nAygun Kazimova (1971-present)\n\nSwitch over to the music scene and meet Azerbaijan\u2019s most successful female singer: Aygun Kazimova. Born in 1971 and boasting a music career stretching more than 30 years, Aygun currently holds the record for the highest number of bestselling singles in Azerbaijan. The singer received multiples awards, both locally and on the international scene, and often gets attributed to bringing modern music to the country. Today, she\u2019s a judge on a popular Azerbaijan talent show called Ozunu Tanit.\n\nAygun Kazimove: Sevdim\n\nEll & Nikki (2011 Eurovision Song Contest Winners)\n\nEll & Nikki deserve a special mention. Ell, or Eldar Gasimov, and Nikki, Nigar Jamal, performed Running Scared in the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest held in Dusseldorf. The duet won the competition, instantly transforming Ell & Nikki into national heroes. Today, both singers enjoy prosperous solo careers.\n\nEll & Nicki: Running Scared\n\nMusa Manarov (1951-present)\n\nBorn in Baku and educated in Moscow, Musa quickly climbed the ranks to become an influential cosmonaut for the Soviet Union. The flight engineer spent a total of 541 days in space, including a stint of 176 consecutive days giving him the former record. Musa also spent over 20 hours performing space walks. In the 21st century, astronauts\/cosmonauts perhaps fail to get the recognition they deserve. But one must remember that Musa\u2019s career was at the height of the Cold War Space Race.\n\nHe spent almost 6 consecutive months in space | \u00a9 UR3IRS\/WikiCommons\n\nLotfi Zadeh (1921-2017)\n\nMathematician and computer scientist Lotfi Zadeh has an impressive record. Baku-born before moving to Iran and later the United States, the prominent figure developed and pioneered a new mathematics concept called fuzzy-sets. Applications range from unmanned devices to car mechanics, air-conditioning and medicine. Lotfi is credited for contributing to the field of time signals, which later revolutionised the digital world. To put this great scientist\u2019s achievements into perspective, his publications received more than 180,000 citations at the time of his death. Arguably, Lofti ranks as the most influential Azerbaijani scientist of all time.\n\nLeyla Mammadbeyova (1922-2006)\n\nQuba-born Leyla broke many taboos to become a highly influential Azerbaijani woman. Not only did Leyla have a successful and fruitful career as a scientist in the Soviet Union, but she was also Azerbaijan\u2019s first female pathologist. With a record of 200 publications contributing to the advancement of pathology and science as well as winning medals for her achievements, Leyla ranks among the most celebrated women ever in Azerbaijan. She also holds the title as the first female pilot in the east.\n\nOne of Azerbaijan's most influential woman | \u00a9 azermarka.az\/WikiCommons\n\nShirali Muslimov (1805-1973)\n\nAs a final entry into this list of most influential Azerbaijanis, Shirali Muslimov features for a different reason. Born in a small village near the Iranian border, the shepherd hailing from the rural hills might have lived to the ripe old age of 168. As the story goes, he worked until the age of 167 as a shepherd, preferred to ride a horse instead of a car and apparently had a daughter at the age of 136! Most dispute this claim because of a lack of records. However, his passport states the date of birth in 1805 and his death certificate records 1973. True or not, most believe he lived several years as a centenarian. Shirali attributed his longevity to a diet of fruit, yoghurt, low-fat cheese and hard work.\n\nRare footage of Shirali. He\u2019s claims to be 165 at the time of the interview",

It flows through mainly flat or gently undulating plains. As a river it is unremarkable. But it is not famous for the qualities of its drainage. It is infamous for what happened there on 25 & 26 June 1876 when a flamboyant, egotistical Cavalry officer, George Armstrong Custer, led his Seventh Cavalry to the worst, and last, military defeat ever inflicted on the US Army by the Plains Indian tribes, the Lakota and Cheyenne, at what they called The Battle of the Greasy Grass. No prizes for guessing what it was that greased the grass of the river\u2019s banks.\n\n\nFive of the twelve companies of the 7th cavalry were wiped out on 25 June, including \u2018I\u2019 Company, led by Carlow-born Captain Myles Keogh, the most senior of thirty-two Irish-born fatalities in the battle.\n\n\nKeogh, from Leighlinbridge, had found his way to his date with destiny by a circuitous route. He had, in 1860, as a twenty year old from a relatively prosperous Catholic family, volunteered for service in the army of the Pope. He wasn\u2019t dressed in a striped uniform guarding the Vatican city, he was fighting, unsuccessfully, to save the Pope\u2019s last remaining landed possessions in Italy. When the American Civil War broke out the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, John Hughes, recruited Keogh and a number of his colleagues, to join the Union Army. He served with distinction through most of the American Civil War as a cavalry officer, fighting at Fredericksburg and Gettysburg and rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\n\n\nAfter the Civil War the American Army was greatly reduced in size but Keogh wanted to stay on. Like most other officers he lost his exalted war-time rank but was not demobilized. He was sent west to join Custer\u2019s 7th Cavalry charged with keeping the peace on the great American Plains and ensuring that nations like the Lakota \u2013 better known as the Sioux \u2013 the Cheyenne, and the Blackfeet, behaved themselves and remained on the relatively useless patches of land that had been set aside for them as \u2018reservations\u2019.\n\n\nKeogh was undoubtedly handsome, dynamic, vigorous and physically courageous. However, he was also described by some colleagues as intemperate, drunken and violent. Although he respected the Native Americans of the Plains as military opponents he had no time for their culture or way of life. He viewed them, quite simply, as savages who needed to be kept permanently in check.\n\n\nHe was part of an Army that had a huge Irish element. 10,000 soldiers were stationed in the American West, a quarter of whom were born in Ireland. The Irish influence can clearly be seen in Custer\u2019s 7th Cavalry. The muster roll in 1876 included 126 Irish-born soldiers out of 822 members of the regiment. Keogh was the only officer. The regiments two marching tunes were the Irish airs \u2018Garryowen\u2019 and \u2018The Girl I Left Behind Me\u2019.\n\n\nThe story of Custer\u2019s massive miscalculation in sending his six hundred strong force against an Indian village that contained up to 5,000 fighting men, has become the stuff of legend. He made things even worse for himself by dividing his command. Everyone who fought with Custer, died with Custer. The only survivor was Keogh\u2019s horse Comanche. Keogh himself was killed a few hundred yards away from Last Stand Hill where his Colonel died. Although he is buried in New York state a gravestone bearing his name marks the spot where he perished, surrounded by the other members of Company \u2018I\u2019. For some reason Keogh\u2019s body was one of the few not to have been mutilated by the victorious Sioux and Cheyenne. He wore a Papal medal, awarded in 1860 by a grateful Pope. This token may have been what saved his corpse from evisceration. The Lakota and Cheyenne, who wore pendants of all kinds to ward off evil spirits, may have been wary of the Pontiff\u2019s decoration.\n\n\nCaptain Myles Walter Keogh, commanding officer of Company \u2018I\u2019 of the Seventh Cavalry was one of two hundred and sixty eight US cavalrymen to die at the Battle of the Greasy Grass or the Little Bighorn, he was born one hundred and seventy-six ago, on this day.",

Featherstonhaugh\n\nMontpelleir Apl. 5. 1821.\n\n\nI have received your favour of March 19.1 & am glad to find that you think of giveing still more value to your Agricultural work, by extending in a new Edition, your practical veiws of the subject. I retain at the same time my opinion in favour of the Chemical instruction which your original plan combined with them.\n\nI know not well what to answer to your enquiry relative to the reception such a Volume would meet with in the Southern States. As to the state in which I live I dare not speak with confidence; so difficult is a deffusion of literary productions thro\u2019 its dispersed readers, and so universal is the present dearth of means even for the minuter articles of cost. I can scarcely doubt however that the attention which has been excited to the practice & the science of rural economy would produce a demand sufficient at least to give a right turn to the scale, if it should need such a weight, which I should not easily suppose would be the case. For myself I sincerely wish that your calculations may justify the experiment: & that, without a pecuniary loss, which would be very unreasonable, it may reward you with the satisfaction of contributing more extensively to enlighten & animate a persuit so deeply interesting to the public prosperity. I renew to you Sir assurances of my esteem & good wishes\n\nJs Madison\n\nFC (DLC). In Dolley Madison\u2019s hand, with JM\u2019s note: \u201cG.W.
