UGH kill me).\n\nYou may recall I went to see The Lion King last year with my friend Nick, so I was stoked to see this one.\n\nMy parents had seen it previously in New York, and my cousin has seen it 3 times, so I figured I wouldn't be dissapointed, and I wasn't.\n\nThe storyline is about the Wicked Witch from The Wizard of Oz... but it focuses on her gorwing up and how she became how she is. It really gives you a different perspective on the whole thing. (Not that you'd thought so hard about the subject before.)\n\nI won't give it all away, but I definitely recommend it. Next stop... Beauty and the Beast if anyone wants to go!\n\n1 comment:\n\nMeerb said...\n\nI should say only that its awesome! The blog is informational and always produce amazing things.Thanks for sharing.",

        "text":"Let\u2019s go to the\u00a0movies!\n\nby Katherine Gould, Associate Curator of Cultural History\n\nWhat is your most memorable movie-going experience? We all have them: the epic love story that made us cry as we gazed up at that big screen; the first special effects experience to blow our minds; or the first make-out session in the back of a darkened theater (confession: Top Gun, 1986, his name was Sean).\n\nFor me, it\u2019s not any one particular movie that is most memorable, but rather my overall movie-going experience as a kid. I grew up on Army bases across the county and most would have a single-screen theater that showed second-run films. I remember the seats being filled not only with kids and parents in civilian clothes but also men and women in uniform. Before the start of each movie, the theater would darken and everybody would rise and remove their caps for the national anthem. The screen would be filled with rousing, patriotic images of tanks rolling across rugged terrain, Navy destroyers smashing through the high seas, and fighter planes soaring over the mountains. Even now, quite a few years later, the memory of those experiences is as clear as day.\n\nI queried the staff of the Indiana State Museum to find out about some of their favorite movie-going experiences. Because sometimes the best part of history is not researching important artifacts or examining \u201cold-timey\u201d photographs, but rather simply recalling our own experiences with the past, and what it means to us. That\u2019s what makes history fun. That\u2019s what makes it personal. So, for some of you, your memory of going to a theater to see Top Gun may involve squealing at seeing Tom Cruise playing beach volleyball or gripping your seat while watching the action-packed fighter jet scenes. For me, the memory is something completely different. Continue reading",

        "text":"Wednesday, September 10, 2008\n\nZombies Eat Brains And Clay\n\nHorror's reach is absolutely never ending, it's tentacles have slithered their way into every medium and it's been made into so many sub-genres. For example, I watched \"Fringe\" last night, which I thought was great, by the way... and it had horror elements, mixed with Sci-Fi, and it's a big network TV show. Some would say that horror's made it's way into music, with guys like Necro, Cradle of Filth and, especially, Rob Zombie, who embody horror elements. Of course, there's film, where you get psycho-thrillers, gore-fests, slasher flicks, you name it... it's almost rare to see a film that doesn't have some element of horror involved. So, as horrors reach continues, sometimes I think we're near a saturation point... I mean, where else could people take it? But, when I saw \"Zombies Eat Brains And Clay\", I realized that we may still be on the tip of the iceberg here.\n\nWhat's \"Zombies Eat Brains And Clay\", you ask? Well, eventually, it's going to be a feature length claymation film. Currently, it's a short film on Youtube, which you'll find embedded below, plus it's a Myspace page, which you'll find here.\n\nAfter watching it and going through their Myspace page, I feel like I've learned a couple things here. One, I love blood and guts that are made out of clay... who knew? Secondly, it just made me think about how there's so much more that can be done in horror. Every time I think I've seen it all, I see something new... on some new medium or in some new form. Whether you think out of the box on how you distribute your idea or content OR you think outside the box on what your idea or content is... the fact remains that there's endless new routes to take out there. We shouldn't get stuck in thinking that you have to make a 90 minute film that conforms to what Hollywood considers standard or acceptable. Get busy making something that isn't standard (or acceptable) and then go find an audience any way you can.\n\nUntil then, enjoy some zombies that, as the title states, eat brains and clay...\n\nNo comments:",

El origen de Billy y su mano derecha, I.A.L., tampoco parece casualidad, as\u00ed como la religi\u00f3n que comparten estos dos con el autor de la obra original.

For decades it was assumed that it happened at Auschwitz, but while researching Polish and Israeli archives, his Austrian biographer Andreas Hutter discovered in 2011 that they were murdered in different locations: his mother, Eugenia \"Gitla\" Siedlisker - in 1943 at\u00a0Plaszow; his stepfather, Bernard \"Berl\" Siedlisker, in 1942 at\u00a0Belzec\u00a0and his grandmother, Balbina Baldinger, died in 1943 in the ghetto in\u00a0Nowy Targ.[6]\n\nY s\u00ed, algo de eso se percibe de manera intuitiva:\n\nWilder was disappointed with the completed film. \"Maybe we went overboard with some of the comic relief, because\u00a0Avanti!\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0a comedy\", he stated. \"If this film had worked the way we wanted it to, it would have had more of the quality of\u00a0The Apartment. I always feel sorry for the disappointment of the actors, and all those dear technical people who do so much, when the picture doesn't make it the way they hoped . . . I went much farther with forbidden themes than I had with\u00a0Kiss Me, Stupid, but nobody cared. Audiences thought it was too long and too bland. I guess they would have liked it better if it turned out the father was having the affair with one of the bellboys at the hotel.\"[4]\n\nAvanti... Brillante es poco decir.
