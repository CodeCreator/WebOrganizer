Perhaps thinking \u201cGod is in control\u201d but living as if you are. It\u2019s like walking around with a hot cup of coffee, afraid that with one wrong move it will spill and be a burning hot mess. Then you realize what little control you have and how dependent on God you truly are.\n\nIn Lose Control, Mary Shannon Hoffpauir takes you on a six-week journey through the Book of First Samuel, which is an epic story about a fight for control. Despite God\u2019s warnings through the prophet Samuel, the nation of Israel was determined to take control by having their own king. As you dig into the saga of King Saul and David, who would become the next anointed king of Israel, you will discover that no plan or purpose of God can be thwarted by human beings. Even the worst of circumstances can be used by God to accomplish His purposes in your life.\n\nIn her no-nonsense, authentic teaching style that endears her to women of all ages, Mary Shannon encourages you to lose control so that you can find your soul through a trusting relationship with your faithful God.\n\nComponents for this six-week Bible study, each available separately, include a Participant Workbook, a Leader Guide, and a DVD with six 25-minute segments (with closed captioning).\n\n*An in-depth six-week exploration of the entire Book of 1 Samuel.\n*Study includes five days of homework for each week.\n*Encourages women to exchange their desire for control for God\u2019s gift of faith.\n*Helps women gain a deeper love and grace for others.\n*DVD features dynamic, engaging teaching in six 25-minute segments.\n\nSKU (ISBN): 9781791004378\nMary Huffpauir\nBinding: Trade Paper\nPublished: 2020\nPublisher: Abingdon Press\n\nPrint On Demand Product\n\n\nThere are no reviews yet.\n\nBe the first to review \u201cLose Control Womens Bible Study Leader Guide\u201d\n\nYour email address will not be published.\n\n\nYour Cart is Empty\n\nBack To Shop",

Does this alleged gap really represent a vast amount of time? Weston Field\u2019s classic treatment of this subject is now being published by Master Books, and promoted by such important organizations as Answers in Genesis. In this book, Fields makes a detailed study of the gap theory, paying particular attention to the original Hebrew language of Genesis. His conclusion - that this theory is not a reasonable compromise with modern evolutionary theory, but a dangerous diversion from biblical truth - helps readers who struggle with the question of the time taken during the creation week. Was it really six days? Can Christians find a workable solution to the debate about creation and time?\n\nRelated Downloads\n(Size: 1018.8 KB)",

(An overview of how the archaeological and historical accuracy of the New Testament confirms that the manuscripts are trustworthy in their reporting and documentation. \u00a0Comparison is made to the lack of archaeological confirmation for The Book of Mormon, and the transition of archaeologist Sir William Mitchell Ramsay from skeptic to believer is considered as well.)\n\nJul 19 - \u00a0The Authors Of The Manuscripts \u00a0(Who wrote the gospels? \u00a0Answering this question helps us assess the credibility of their testimony. \u00a0The early Christian writings and manuscripts all confirm that the four books were written by the men whose names they bear. \u00a0We also examine how their backgrounds and professions and experiences confirm them to be dependable witnesses.)\n\nJul 23 - Agreement of the Manuscripts \u00a0(Do the documents containing the kernel of the gospel contradict one another? \u00a0We examine ten alleged discrepancies between Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts. \u00a0The texts are harmonized in the light of two self-evident rules: a contradiction only exists if two things cannot both be true, and specifics do not exclude. \u00a0I contend that no charge of contradiction can be sustained against the gospel historians as there are no irreconcilable discrepancies, and that no one can charge them with collusion since they differ in the details.)\n\nJul 26 - \u00a0The Crucifixion_ The First Stubborn Fact - Jesus Died By Crucifixion \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Are there facts about the kernel of the gospel that even unbelievers must accept and acknowledge? \u00a0Yes. \u00a0As John Adams said, \"Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\" \u00a0In defense of the gospel, we summon the first stubborn fact before the seething masses of unbelief: Jesus died by crucifixion, and pagans and Jews in the first and second centuries admitted to it.)\n\nJul 30The Resurrection_ The Second Stubborn Fact - The Disciples Believed They Saw The Risen Jesus \u00a0(The second stubborn fact: the disciples believed they saw the risen Jesus. \u00a0This is evident from oral and written claims, the early Christian writings, and the concessions of skeptics.)\n\nAug 02The Resurrection_ The Third Stubborn Fact - Paul The Persecutor Became The Preacher \u00a0(The third stubborn fact: Saul of Tarsus, a Hebrew of Hebrews, zealous for Judaism, became Paul the preacher, the most devoted Christian that ever lived, enduring the very persecutions he fomented.)\n\nAug 06 -\u00a0The Resurrection_ The Fourth And Fifth Stubborn Facts - The Conversion Of James And Empty Tomb\u00a0 (The final stubborn facts: James, Jesus' skeptical sibling, became a suffering servant of Christ's, and Jesus' tomb was found empty. \u00a0The empty tomb is confirmed by the Jerusalem factor, the implicit admission of His enemies, and the testimony of women. \u00a0When we harmonize these five facts, none of which are supernatural, we are left with but one conclusion to draw: the supernatural is the only way to explain them!)\n\nAug 09 -\u00a0The Resurrection_ Eliminating The Impossible, Pt. 1\u00a0(Sherlock Holmes said, \"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\" \u00a0The five stubborn facts confirm the kernel of the gospel: Jesus died, was buried, arose, and appeared. \u00a0Nonetheless, skeptics offer \"alternative facts\" to explain away the resurrection as a natural event. \u00a0In this study we begin to eliminate the impossible: naturalistic explanations. \u00a0I posit that the highly improbable, a bodily resurrection from the dead, is the best explanation for the gospel story. \u00a0We begin by surveying the fallacies of naturalism and its objections to miracles: disbelief in God, total belief in science, the claim that resurrections are disproved by science, deistic preconceptions, the improbability of miracles, and the counterfeit \"miracles\" of today. \u00a0Naturalism dies on the hill of atheism, while faith lives on the mountaintops.)\n\nAug 13 -\u00a0The Resurrection_ Eliminating The Impossible, Pt. 2\u00a0 (Strangely enough, there are still those who question whether Jesus ever lived. \u00a0Others say that the gospel just recycled pagan myths of dying and rising gods that preceded it, but gave the myth a new name and face. \u00a0Still others concede that Jesus lived, but they say He wasn't what the gospels made Him out to be; His followers embellished His life and ministry after He died until it grew to legendary proportions. \u00a0NONE of these attempts to dodge the evidence for the resurrection succeed at removing Jesus and His chief miracle from the realm of history.)\n\nAug 16 -\u00a0The Resurrection_ Eliminating The Impossible, Pt. 3\u00a0 (Skeptics have some tall mountains to climb: they must either demonstrate a fallacy in the Christian's logic, which the philosophy of naturalism fails to do; or they must discredit the evidence, and the baseless claims of the gospel plagiarizing pagan myths fail to do that; OR they must suggest an alternative explanation for the facts that's just as plausible if not more so than the resurrection. \u00a0Three alternative explanations fail to do that: the stolen body theory, the swoon theory, and the hallucination theory.)\n\nAug 20 The Resurrection_ The Authority Of The Manuscripts\u00a0 (My friend Kenny Chumbley said, \"Christians do not believe that Jesus is God because the Bible is inspired; they believe the Bible is inspired because Jesus is God.\" \u00a0The resurrection confirms Jesus' divinity, and Jesus' divinity confirms the inspiration of the Scriptures\u2014they have been written by God through the agency of man. \u00a0Inspired documents are inerrant: there are no errors in the history they record, the laws they give, the morals they encourage, or the hope that they offer. \u00a0We can furthermore have confidence in the canon of Scripture\u2014the officially accepted list of inspired books. \u00a0\"A book is not the word of God because it is accepted by the people of God. \u00a0Rather, it is accepted by the people of God because it is the word of God\" (Josh McDowell & Dave Sterrett).\n\nAug 23The Resurrection - Stumbling Blocks of Faith pt1\u00a0(The Resurrection having been established as historical fact, and the inspiration of the Scriptures having been proven as a result, we now turn our attention to three stumbling blocks to faith. \u00a0The Resurrection will help us answer these challenges from our critics, and guard us from the deluding influence of the world.\u00a0\u00a0The first two are the theory of evolution and modern-day paganism.)\n\nDue to Hurricane Harvey, Todd was not able to finish his classes in August. Following are the last two classes.\n\nOct 22 -\u00a0The Resurrection - Stumbling Blocks of Faith pt2... (truncated)",
