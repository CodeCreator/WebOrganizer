        "text":"Hi, everyone. I'm Ned Colletti, General Manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2006-2014. I'm currently promoting my new book THE BIG CHAIR. You can buy it here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2yobxjn\n\nBefore the Dodgers, I was an assistant General Manager of the San Francisco Giants after getting my start with the Chicago Cubs (my home team). Currently, I'm a baseball analyst on Spectrum SportsNet LA.\n\nProof: https:\/\/twitter.com\/realnedcolletti\/status\/919963754254569477\n\nAsk me anything - I'm ready!\n\nUPDATE: Great questions all around - we had fun! More questions than I could answer . . . thanks for having me, Reddit!\n\nComments:\u00a0157\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Responses:\u00a025 \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Date:\u00a0\n\nSlimJimMagoo67 karma\n\nHi, Ned!\n\nWhat was it that you saw in Justin Turner that no other team did? Scouting reports? Or was it just this gut feeling? Definitely one of your best moves during your tenure as GM, so thank you!\n\nNedColletti132 karma\n\nWe had decided to not resign three very good players - Skip Shumaker, Nick Punto and Jerry Hairston, Jr. I felt we needed a younger player who could play multiple positions. JT was a good offensive player at that point. He was also younger. He was from LA so he knew how special the Dodgers are. We thought he was going to be an average fielder and a good hitter. He has turned out to be a tremendous hitter, defender and leader. He worked during the off-seasons to go from a solid utility player, to a star on a great team. Hard work paid off for him. Very proud of him.\n\nLuckyWarrior48 karma\n\nYour most hectic trade deadline\/winter meeting story?\n\nNedColletti97 karma\n\nAcquiring Manny Ramirez on July 31, 2008 from Boston. Some cool detail in the book.\n\nbeachlyf4me35 karma\n\nHey Ned!!! Exciting times in Dodgerland these days....and we owe a lot of it to you!!!\n\nMost underrated food in Chavez Ravine?\n\nNedColletti24 karma\n\nThank you. Many people for many years worked, made tough decisions and sacrificed a lot to have a team like the 2017 Dodgers.\n\nanthrofighter24 karma\n\nNed, how excited are you see a NL Pennant coming our way soon?\n\nNedColletti79 karma\n\nWell, there is still another game to win - typically the last one is the hardest to win. If that would come to pass, I don't know that I have the words to explain what it really means to me. Winning is difficult; winning a pennant is so very difficult. It would be one of the grandest highlights of my life and professional career. And it would put the franchise in position, for the all-time professional highlight, a World Series Championship.\n\nWraithfighter23 karma\n\nOkay, here's a tricky question for you...\n\nIf you had to convince a San Francisco Giants fan to root for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS and World Series, what would you say?\n\n(and yes, I'm a Giants Fan :D )\n\nNedColletti45 karma\n\nI could say because I'm a great guy and therefore you should root for the Dodgers. But not sure that will sway you. Because they are a National League team and you are an NL fan. And because I don't ever root against anyone; I root for people and teams. For a couple of weeks, it may be an interesting reversal for you!\n\njojoleigh12322 karma\n\nWhat was the most exciting part of being GM of the Dodgers?\n\nNedColletti32 karma\n\nThe chance to compete every day and be part of an iconic franchise. I love to compete and team build - both those in uniform and also the executive\/analytical\/scouting\/player development ranks. To have that opportunity daily was very cool.\n\nnucc214817 karma\n\nWhat makes the Dodgers a special team?\n\nNedColletti57 karma\n\nThe Dodgers are very talented to start with; but that doesn't make it a championship calibre team. They are a close knit group and they play smart and pay attention to every detail of the game. Offensively, they make pitchers throw strikes - they don't chase out of the zone. From the mound, they don't walk many hitters and their pitching plans are sound. They are also an unselfish group. Dave Roberts and the front office have done a tremendous job of building, sustaining and fortifying a winning culture. That's what makes them special IMO.\n\nUhhBonelessDinger14 karma\n\nHey Ned. What was your honest projection of Kershaw when you drafted him? Hes been a blast to watch.\n\nNedColletti51 karma\n\nI thought he had a chance to be the ace of a staff or at least a number 2 starter. I don't think anyone could project an 18-year-old to be a Hall of Famer. The number of twists and turns a career can take are many. The growth I have seen in him from June 2006, has been enormous - both on and off the field. He is a once-in-a-generation pitcher and an even better person.\n\nKperry3111 karma\n\nHow much do you enjoy teaching at Pepperdine?\n\nNedColletti10 karma\n\nI love teaching at Pepperdine University. It has been one of the best opportunities I have ever had. The Sports Management program there is growing and leadership is adding very smart staff, people who are not only intellectual, but also have successful in-the-field experience. It has provided me with an opportunity to give back some of the blessings I have been given. I find so many parts of my career, I can now explain to a young person and perhaps help them in their lives and careers. The students have been excellent. They are first and foremost, wonderful people. They provide me with hope. They also teach me.\n\nBBFriendshipExpress8 karma\n\nWhat is it like becoming an analyst from SNLA?\n\nThank Ned!\n\nNedColletti13 karma\n\nIt has been a great experience working with SNLA. The people who comprise the staff are some of the finest people I have ever been around. It is a wonderful team of people. It has kept me connected to the game and to the Dodgers. It has been a challenge for me as well.\n\nturningxpoint917 karma\n\nHello Ned,\n\nAre there any conflicting feelings watching the Dodgers, the team you are associated with professionally, and the Cubs, your childhood team, facing each other?\n\nNedColletti16 karma\n\nNone...I have a lot of my life sown into the fabric of the Dodgers. I have been a part of the organization for the last dozen years. Although I have loved what I have been able to do for many years, I have sacrificed a lot along the way. I want to see it through and I want the Dodgers to win it all. Without any doubt.\n\nKitten_of_Death7 karma\n\nHey Ned!\n\nWhat was it like being a GM in the midst of ownership drama? Did it ever impact your day-to-day? Was it something that didn't actually matter much?\n\n\nIf\/when you played (at any level), what was your favorite position to play?\n\nNedColletti13 karma\n\nI learned a lot during those years from some very smart people. Including i had to figure out what in life, if anything, I could control and effect in a positive way. There was a lot going on that I\/we couldn't change. I learned to stay focused on what I was in charge of and what I could make better. Everything else I had to let go of. It was an incredible learning experience. I played second base and centerfield. I loved playing and competing. The breaking ball made me an executive.\n\nderekcanmexit6 karma\n\nHow did you get your start working in baseball? Who was your mentor while you were building your baseball career? What advice would you give to someone who is trying to break into the industry?\n\nNedColletti10 karma\n\nI had many mentors in baseball. During my early years with the Cubs it was Dallas Green and Jim Finks - two of the greatest leaders I have ever been around. I learned from very wise and smart baseball men - Don Zimmer, Jim Frey, John Vukovich, Lee Elia, Billy Connors. In SF, it was Dusty Baker and Bob Quinn and one of the wisest men I have ever met - Felipe Alou. Of course, Brian Sabean is also someone who taught me a lot. In LA, it was a pleasure to work with Joe Torre - smart, wise, successful - and Don Mattingly - one of the best hitters during his playing career and an extremely hard worker. My advice is to get in the door - don't pass on opportunities because it isn't the perfect job. Once you have a chance, prove to leadership that you are talented, honorable, relentless, humble and have integrity - out work everyone - first in; last out, day after day. Maximize what you have a chance to control: effort, thought-process, dedication, etc.\n\nteeohdeedee1236 karma\n\nWhat's your favorite pizza place in Chicago?\n\nNedColletti33 karma\n\nMomma Maria's...western suburbs...not a chain...but very good. Thin crust the best!\n\nwemissyoujose5 karma\n\nHow were you able to work yourself up to one of the highest positions in the organization with such an unusual starting point in the game?\n\nNedColletti12 karma\n\nI have never been the smartest person in any room. I was relentless in my approach. I would do the jobs no one wanted to do and I would do them to the utmost. I never gave up. More than anything, I was blessed beyond measure.\n\nVinForPrez4 karma\n\nHey Ned!\n\n  1. How special was it to draft\/watch Kershaw develop, and are we appreciating what we are witnessing with his career enough?\n\n  2. Similar question as Kershaw, but did you ever envision Kenley becoming who he is now as a closer and more importantly a leader?\n\nThank you for taking the time to do this!\n\nNedColletti8 karma\n\nKenley had so much ability and he understood pitching because of being a catcher. There was a pretty good chance that he would become who he is now. But it took time, hard work, learning and execution on his part. His numbers - while in a smaller sample size - are Mariano Rivera like. Professionally, he is so dedicated to this team, fan base and city. And, yes, his leadership has become apparent in a big way.\n\nRalphdaddy134 karma\n\nHi Ned! Can't wait to read your new book. It's on my wish list to the Wife :) my question is... Greg Maddux. What made him so dominating with a fastball in the Mid 80's?\n\nNedColletti14 karma\n\nThought process, clean delivery, photographic memory, genius, fearless, ability to execute.\n\nObamaBigBlackCaucus3 karma\n\nMy friend Tyler is getting married in a few months. Do you have any words of advice for him? He's a huge Giants fan, for what it's worth.\n... (truncated)",

Nicely done.\n\nROLAND THATCHER: Yeah. I'm in good position through two rounds, and hopefully I can do something special here over the weekend.\n\nQ. You're working on the weekend. It's been a little while.\n\nROLAND THATCHER: Yeah, unfortunately. I'm probably the least consistent player on this TOUR, so whenever I go out and miss five, six cuts in a row, that doesn't really surprise anybody, nor should it surprise anybody that occasionally I put together four rounds. So hopefully this is one of those weeks where I make a lot of money in a very short amount of time.\n\nQ. That's the thing. When you get it going, it stays going.\n\nROLAND THATCHER: Yeah, and that's the whole reason I've had a job here for as many years as I've had it is I've been able to get out of my own way when things start going well, and hopefully it's one of those weeks where that happens.\n\nQ. What have you found this week? What's working?\n\nROLAND THATCHER: I don't know. I guess I hit it a lot less than I've been hitting it before.\n\nYou know, I really haven't been in trouble that often. I've hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens. I feel really like I left a lot of shots out there the last couple of days, which is odd for somebody who really hadn't been playing all that well to say.\n\nQ. Although that can happen here, because there are a lot of birdies to be had out there.\n\nROLAND THATCHER: Yeah, definitely. This is probably one of the shorter courses we play. We're hitting a lot of wedges, so a lot of guys are having good looks and good opportunities, and I had a few today, and I wish I would have made a few more, but I'll be in position for the weekend.\n\nQ. Are there any courses down there in Auburn that are anything like this because Claxton's playing well, Christian's playing well; you're playing well. Dufner oughta be here. He'd probably be playing well because he's playing well everywhere.\n\nROLAND THATCHER: Yeah. I think we're all glad he's taking a week off, to tell you the truth. No, nothing really quite like this.\n\nQ. How cool is this for all you Auburn guys to really get it going??\n\nROLAND THATCHER: Yeah, it's great. Jason and I have been really the only two representatives for the university out for a number of years, and it's great to have Will out. It's great to have Gary out. It really speaks to the program for what they've done, especially with the different ages of all of us. To have that many guys come through at different stages, it's pretty fun.\n\nQ. I was going to say, none of you have played together much, did you??\n\nROLAND THATCHER: Jason and I were there for five years together, but we didn't share time with either of the other two.\n\nQ. How about --\n\nROLAND THATCHER: Yeah, it's nice.\n\nQ. 7\ufffd under overall. This is your first time making it into the weekend at TPC River Highlands. Can you figure something out on this course or is something just suiting your eye more??\n\nROLAND THATCHER: No. I learned a long time ago I don't figure anything out when it comes to golf. It is what it is. I've managed to put together two rounds and hopefully I can put together two more.\n\nQ. To me what's most impressive is you're coming off five consecutive cuts. That has to be a little discouraging, but you obviously have pushed through, persevered. What do you do to mentally keep yourself in the game??\n\nROLAND THATCHER: That's kind of business as usual for me. I can't remember the last time making consecutive cuts out on TOUR. So I'm the ultimate guy, I'll go out and miss a bunch of cuts in a row, but I'll play real well and get it done in a few weeks, so hopefully it's one of those weeks that I can make a lot toward keeping my card for next year.\n\nQ. For you heading into the weekend, what's going to be the key to really capitalize on the position you're in right now??\n\nROLAND THATCHER: Just stay out of my own way, basically, is the biggest thing. Things are working pretty well for me right now. I'm doing a lot of things the way I want to do them, and as long as I don't get in my own way and don't think too much about it, it should be just fine.\n\nQ. How do you feel out there today??\n\nROLAND THATCHER: I felt pretty hot and pretty sweaty. (Laughs). But I feel good with the number. It was a good two\ufffd day total for me, and I feel like I'm going to have a chance out here over the weekend and I'm really excited about that.\n\nQ. What happened on 18??\n\nROLAND THATCHER: I drove it in the rough and got the lie you should get when you're in the rough and didn't really judge the lie real well. I really had a pretty reasonable up\ufffd and\ufffd down in the bunker. But I guess it couldn't end up all good today, so a little sour taste in my mouth at the end of the day, but still a good day.",

        "text":"Adam Cole on when he found out he would be joining Bullet Club, shades a gray in pro wrestling\n\nimgresRing of Honor wrestler Adam Cole spoke with Brian Fritz of Sporting News and was asked when he found out he would be joining the Bullet Club faction. \u201cI found out about a month, month and a half before this whole thing was set up and to say the least I was pretty stoked,\u201d Cole said. \u201cOn top of it really changing my position I think in ROH because of the Bullet Club\u2019s impact. Obviously, this really opens up some doors for me in New Japan. Anyone who has listened to me do interviews before knows how much being a part of New Japan Pro Wrestling is something that I\u2019d really, really like to do.\u201d\n\nCole also discussed shades of gray in pro wrestling. \u201cI\u2019m glad you brought that up because, definitely, you can see across the board, not just even in Ring of Honor or New Japan but also in the WWE,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot more now there\u2019s a focus on that shades of gray, guys becoming stars and becoming as popular as they can whether they\u2019re being cheered or whether they\u2019re being booed and almost letting the fans make the decision of who they like and who they want to cheer for and who they want to support. A perfect example is if myself and Jay Lethal wrestle for the ROH World Title. I can almost guarantee you that the crowd is going to be split 50-50. There\u2019s a lot of those moments in Ring of Honor now. Same with Jay Lethal and Jay Briscoe, same with myself and Kyle O\u2019Reilly.\u201d Read the full interview at\n\nPowell\u2019s POV: I\u2019m happy for Cole and I think he\u2019s one of the most talented wrestlers in ROH. He and the rest of the Bullet Club members will have to work hard to keep the momentum going. With so many incarnations of the group it\u2019s starting to feel a bit watered down and overexposed. I\u2019m not a big believer in shades of gray. Give me a traditional babyface vs. heel match with a heel working hard to get heat. If some fans still cheer the heel then it does make for a fun dynamic, but I\u2019m not big on cool heels. In fact, I\u2019m a big believer in what TNA\u2019s Rockstar Spud told Fritz in a March interview.\n\nJason Powell and Jake Barnett co-host the Dot Net Weekly and Pro Wrestling Boom Podcast combo show and discuss Raw Underground and other WWE concepts, The Rock's group buying the XFL, the Marty Jannetty story, AEW Dynamite and NXT TV, and more...\n\nBe the first to comment\n\nLeave a comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.\n\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Was this an easy case to make \u2026 or tough?\u00a0\nA: Truthfully, when you break down all the number, it was a pretty easy argument. Bart Starr won five championships in a seven-year window (1961-\u201967), was the NFL\u2019s MVP in 1966 and has the greatest postseason record of any quarterback in league history (9-1). Brett Favre rescued a downtrodden franchise and brought it back to prominence. Favre remains the only quarterback in NFL history to win three straight MVP\u2019s, played in two Super Bowls and won one. In addition, he set virtually every passing record in NFL history. And Aaron Rodgers has the highest quarterback rating in NFL history, already has two MVPs and one Super Bowl title. Oh yeah, and Rodgers is still just 31 years old.\u00a0\nThere are a number of teams that have had two remarkable quarterbacks. San Francisco had Joe Montana and Steve Young. There was Johnny Unitas and Peyton Manning in Baltimore\/Indianapolis and Terry Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh. But when the third-best quarterback from those franchises is identified, there\u2019s a huge dropoff. And that\u2019s what separates Green Bay from the others and makes the Packers the runaway winner.\nQ: Brett Favre wrote the book\u2019s foreword. In it, he has this great line about how Green Bay is different from other football towns. About how it\u2019s centered on football: \u201c[I]n Green Bay, you\u2019re here to play football.\u201d The timing of your book\u2019s release couldn\u2019t be better, because for the first time in several years, Packers fans are once again celebrating Favre\u2019s time playing football in Wisconsin, rather than some of the drama that followed when he went on to play for the Jets and Vikings. By writing about the Packers history and its present in a primarily positive way, were you hoping to bring fans together?\nA: That wasn\u2019t the primary goal, but I understand if that\u2019s a byproduct.\u00a0\nExperiencing Favre\u2019s return to Lambeau first-hand in late-July was remarkable. Where else would you get 70,000 people to pay money to hear a man to give a speech? And not just pay money \u2014 but to yell and scream like it\u2019s a playoff game.\nOf course, Favre is kind of like Elvis, James Dean and Frank Sinatra rolled into one \u2026 and I don\u2019t think his popularity can ever be equaled in Green Bay. You saw that during his Homecoming. People have forgiven him, so perhaps the timing of the book is pretty good.\nPeople get a chance to read about three of the greatest players in Packers history and what makes them all so unique at their craft.\nQ: In the introduction, you make the following statement: \u201cNo franchise anywhere has had a better trio than Green Bay\u2019s threesome of Bart Starr, Brett Favre, and Aaron Rodgers.\u201d I\u2019ll bet that statement gets a strong response from people. What types of reaction have you heard so far?\nA: I think when people truly examine the evidence, they\u2019ll agree. Personally, I don\u2019t think any of Green Bay\u2019s quarterbacks merit discussion as the best in NFL history. I would argue New England\u2019s Tom Brady or San Francisco\u2019s Joe Montana is No. 1. But I would put Favre in the top-7, Starr no worse than 10th and Rodgers inside the top-25 right now. Of course, Rodgers is still climbing, and with a few more rings, would join the discussion as the best ever. So when you add everything up, the Packers really are runaway winners in this competition.\nQ: You\u2019ve written a lot about this team over the years. Did you learn anything new while researching this book?\nA: I learned a lot of new stuff about Bart Starr, and I think readers will love that chapter. I learned about how stern his father was and how he was always trying to please him. The toughness of Starr\u2019s father made it a lot easier to play for a demanding coach like Vince Lombardi.\nI learned how close Aaron Rodgers was to giving up his football dreams altogether when he was leaving Pleasant Valley High School (Calif.). And I learned a lot of the intricate details about the Brett Favre trade in Feb., 1992 from Ron Wolf himself \u2014 the man who pulled off the greatest heist in Packers\u2019 history.\nQuite honestly, I also learned a great deal about the other franchises represented in the book, as well. We do a top-10 list inside the book of the greatest quarterbacking trios. Then I wrote a chapter on each of the quarterbacks from that list. Many of those quarterbacks played before I was alive or studied football like I do today. So through research and several calls to former coaches and teammates, I was able to learn a lot about those other terrific quarterbacks.\nQ: What is your favorite story from the book?\nA: It might not be the best story, but it\u2019s my favorite line.\nDuring a long talk with former Packers general manager Ron Wolf about Brett Favre, I asked Wolf, \u201cWhat would you have done if you didn\u2019t make the Favre trade?\u201d\nHis response? \u201cWhat if the queen had #@*$?\u201d\nThis was Wolf at his best. Open. Honest. Unfiltered. His bold and bombastic approach is what allowed him to trade for Favre and eventually turn the Packers from an NFL laughingstock into Super Bowl champions.\nQ: You cover some pretty legendary pro athletes, but you also write about our local high school\u2019s student athletes. Do you need to switch gears when you go back and forth?\nA: Without question.\nHigh school athletes play for the love of the game. They don\u2019t make a nickel, they\u2019re playing the sport for the sheer joy of it, and they\u2019re still just kids.\nWhile my job is to tell people what happened and why something occurred, I will never criticize a high school athlete. We almost always try to emphasize the positive and find silver linings.\nWhen it comes to professional athletes, it\u2019s a much different story. They\u2019re grown men with large salaries and every move is open to scrutiny. It\u2019s a big-boy game and criticism is part of that game.\nWinning at the highest level can be intoxicating. But when you lose, the \u201cwhy\u201d has to be explored. People are criticized for that. Feathers can be ruffled.\nMost coaches and athletes understand this. They may not like it, but it\u2019s part of the deal.\nThe difference in the two levels of competition \u2014 professional and high school \u2014 is something I enjoy immensely.\nRate this article:\u00a0\nAverage: 4.3 (4 votes)",

        "text":"EXCLUSIVE | The man who helped save BJ Penn\u2019s career, Dr. Pete Goldman\n\nDr. Peter Goldman\n\nWhile MMA fans are certainly familiar with the legendary career of our very own BJ Penn, many MMA fans may not be familiar with the man who helped save Penn\u2019s career following his UFC 46 win over Matt Hughes which saw him capture the welterweight championship.\n\nUnfortunately, Penn was experiencing severe neck pain throughout the course of the day. That\u2019s when he met Dr. Pete Goldman, the expert of \u2018The Zone Technique\u2019 used to treat numerous top level athletes, as well as ordinary patients.\n\nDr. Pete recalled the story:\n\nI first met BJ Penn in mid 2004. He has already beat Matt Hughes and was the UFC champ. His neck was in pain 24 hours a day, and I think he was even considering retirement and neck surgery. He has tried many things to heal with no success. His MRI indicated some disc herniations. At the time we met, we were only going to be in the same geographic location for a few days. I adjusted him 6 times in those few days and his neck has been 100% since then. BJ Penn is still a close friend and a client.\n\nMany readers may be wondering what The Zone Technique actually is. Dr. Pete explains:\n\n\u201cThe zone technique is one of the many techniques of chiropractic and I would say it\u2019s the best. It\u2019s the only technique that I know of that can reset the various brain centers so that they can be in harmony with the systems of the body that they monitor and control.\u201d\n\nEssentially, The Zone Technique follows the belief that many pains, diseases, and discomforts can be cured by balancing one of the 6 zones within the human body by stimulating vertebrae along the spine. When the points along the spine are stimulated, they send signals up through the spinal cord to the zone in the brain, resulting in a balancing of the body, with the end result being healing.\n\nWhile many may be skeptical of this technique, Dr. Pete says that the best response is results:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about RESULTS not theories. I don\u2019t even care about theories, I only care about healing results. So let\u2019s say a patient has had migraine headaches for the last 10 years and has tried many things with no results, my idea would be: \u2018come to me and watch the headaches become a thing of the past.'\u201d\n\nOur very own BJ Penn spoke about the results Dr. Pete is talking about, saying:\n\n\u201c10 years ago Dr Pete gave me so much relief from my herniated disc in my neck that it has never been A problem again, from that point on I have been a loyal follower of dr Pete and his works whenever I have a physical sickness or injury dr Pete is the person I contact right away for treatment or advice.\u201d\n\nFor more information on The Zone Technique, head on over to TheZoneTechnique.com.

A long time racer, both in road and cyclocross. Announcer for some of the biggest races held here in Cincinnati. Promoter and organizer for the OVCX race, Gun Club CX. He even has a podcast. I was excited to have the opportunity to interview him. Despite his busy schedule, John took the time to answer some of the questions I have always been curious about. He is somewhat of a legend around the cycling community and I hope you enjoy his answers as much as I did.\n\nJudi LoPresti: You are a roadie. How did you get into Cyclocross?\n\nJohn Gatch: I started \u2019crossing a long time ago when I was a Junior as a wintertime diversion\/training option. My first cyclocross race was in Colorado Springs, Colorado in January, in the deep snow with USCF Coach Eddie B. screaming at me to keep going.\n\nJL: Tell me about how you got roped into organizing an event like Gun Club?\n\nJG: This will be my tenth year promoting and producing a cyclocross race. I started because it\u2019s a heck of a lot less hassle putting on a \u2019cross race than a road race or criterium. I was burned out on the road race promotion front.\n\nJL: How did Gun Club become the venue for this race?\n\nJG: As participation grew I started to look for a venue with multiple course options, parking and a building for registration, food, etc. The Gun Club fits the bill with its massive lodge, fireplace, kitchen, bathrooms and over 100 acres. It\u2019s owned by some brothers who I know from church.\n\nJL: What\u2019s up with the skirt?\n\nJG: Skirt? What are you talking about? I did wear lederhosen at the race last year. [see picture above] I figured the promoter should be easy to spot. This year I\u2019m looking for a matador\u2019s outfit.\n\nJL: How do you go about setting the course up each year? It is always so brutal, but my personal favorite of the OVCX series.\n\nJG: I do a lot of riding out there leading up to the event. My \u2019cross training buddy, Mikey, and I tweak it every year. I am especially proud of the \u201cvalley of death\u201d section we came up with last year where riders could choose one of two ways across a creek before a steep-ass hill.\n\nJohn Gatch\n\nGatch in action on the cyclocross course. Photo courtesy of John Gatch.\n\nJL: Tell me about what all it takes to organize an event like Gun Club CX, how far in advance do you start?\n\nJG: I actually start the day after the race. I\u2019ll sit down and make a list of what worked, what didn\u2019t work, course notes, total the receipts, list ideas for next year, etc. I then put all that away until mid-August when I\u2019ll pull a race permit, solicit sponsors, design a new logo, inventory my equipment, and start to get my volunteer crew assembled.\n\nJL: Does it get in the way of your own training? How do you get it all done?\n\nJG: Not really. I try to stay organized. As long as I don\u2019t procrastinate I can stay on top of it OK.\n\nJL: The race is set for early October this year. How do you think the race will differ from years past when it\u2019s usually in November?\n\nJG: Other than starting the planning earlier I don\u2019t think so. I suppose it could be a bit warmer. Also, we gain a little daylight in the morning. That will help with set up.\n\nJL: Which do you like better, announcing at a race or organizing a race?\n\nJG: I like racing a race best. This year I\u2019ve been able to double up and announce and race some crits. I am super psyched to announce the UCI3 Cincinnati Cyclocross Festival with Dave Towle. I\u2019ve know Dave for a long time but have never announced with him. The organizing bit is a big job but the payoff is race day when everyone arrives, registration is humming, events start on time, the grill is fired up, the marching band is playing, and the crowd is pumped.\n\nJL: Would you consider racing the event anytime soon? I think you\u2019d kick ass at cyclocross.\n\nJG: The Gun Club is getting too big for me to take the time to race it. The last time I raced it was three or four years ago. I did get fifth in the A race, but guys are getting faster and I\u2019m getting older and slower!\n\nJL: Tell me about your podcast. How did you come up with it?\n\nJG: It was my wife\u2019s idea. I\u2019d just come back home from a weekend of racing and immediately got on the phone with one of my teammates (the other John) to re-hash the events. She was like, \u201cLord! You guys just spent the weekend together racing and your still talking about it. Do a podcast or something!\u201d And so it was born. She even came up with name. We like to think the podcast is the kind of conversation you\u2019d have in a car with a bunch of buddies driving home from a race.\n\nJL: How did you get the announcing gig? You do such a good job! You make us all feel like rockstars.\n\nJG: Thank you. I\u2019ve never met a microphone I didn\u2019t like and I have no fear of speaking in front of large crowds. I love the challenge of educating and entertaining a crowd at a bike race no matter what the category. Plus, I know the feeling of being in a race and hearing your name over the PA. It\u2019s pretty cool. I like to recognize who\u2019s putting out the effort regardless of age or experience level.\n\nJohn Gatch\nGatch with a second place trophy and some seriously muddy bikes. Photo courtesy of John Gatch\n\nJL:\u00a0 You won the Tandem Championship Nationals last year. Do you plan to go to Bend to compete again next month?\n\nJG: Sadly no plans at this point. My tandem partner\u2019s wife had a kid recently. I don\u2019t think it would go over too well. Life always intervenes in bike racing.\n\nJL: Name your favorite belgium beer.\n\nWow, now that\u2019s a good question. I\u2019d have to say Westmalle Abbey \u2013 Tripel, but for an American Belgie-style beer the Ommegang Abbey Ale is an excellent Dubbel at an awesome price.",

        "text":"Saturday, July 01, 2006\n\nJim Williams: Former United coach Ray Hudson weighs in on World Cup\nPDF | Email\nJim Williams, The Examiner\nJul 1, 2006 5:00 AM\n\nWASHINGTON - Former D.C. United coach Ray Hudson has taken his expansive knowledge of soccer and quick wit to Gol TV.\nFor the past two years, Ray Hudson has done color commentary for European league matches and is co-host of \u201cAmerican Soccer.\u201d\nHudson is now in Germany covering the 2006 FIFA World Cup; he is the co-host for the English-language segment of the nightly \u201cGol TV in Germany\u201d wrap-up show. The show can be seen nightly at 8 with plenty of replays during the evening and early morning if you miss the early show.\nHudson spoke on the World Cup from the International Broadcast Center in Munich.\nJim Williams: What has impressed you most at World Cup 2006?\nRay Hudson: I have been impressed with the passion that has been shown here in Germany. The people have been great and everywhere you go they are talking soccer. The games have been well staged, well attended and seeing fans from all over the world get together and celebrate soccer has been a wonderful thing.\nJW: Has the officiating been as bad as it has been made out to be?\nRH: In a way I feel bad for the officials. They were told by FIFA to call the games close and not to allow any diving, hard tackles or shirt pulling. FIFA wanted the rules to be upheld to the letter of the law and then when the officials did that, FIFA executives threw them under the train. The officials have made some bad calls but certainly not as many as has been reported.\nJW: United States Coach Bruce Arena is taking the heat for the team\u2019s early exit from the World Cup. Is it fair to blame Bruce?\nRH: Bruce certainly has to get some of the blame but so does the team. I mean they simply did not show up here in Germany. Players like Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley let the team down by hiding from the action. So, yes, you can blame Bruce but you can\u2019t forget the players in this World Cup. They were on the largest stage in sports and showed up like deer looking in the headlights.\nRay is always informative and entertaining to be sure. Check him out on Gol TV.\nJim Williams is a seven-time Emmy Award-winning TV producer, director and writer.\n\nRay Hudson PLUS +\n\nRay was very excited about the fans in the US and their following of WC. He felt that they really wanted to know and understand the sport.\n\n\"These are the people at Publix, they stop and talk about the games and who is good and bad. They care about what is next for the US team and that is a very good sign for the growth of soccer in this country.\"\n\nRay said the be patient with the US team \"It is a big learning curve that the US has to battle. They have come a long way but to become a member of the top teams in Europe or South America will take time. Kids in Europe and South Amnerica pick the game up and play it in the streets and they play from morning to night without coaches around, it becomes fun and they learn most of all to be creative. Until that begins to happen here in this country we will have to be content to a good but not great soccer country.\"\n\nHe also said that \"Gol TV has been a very good place for him and that he thinks that once the WC is over that they ahave a place to follow the top players. Gol TV has the best players in the best leagues around the world and after WC we hope to showcase them on a weekly basis. It is a good thing for soccer fans to have the outlet and Gol TV provides it...\"\n\nYour weekend TV Day Planner..\n\nOLN - Tour de France Saturday and Sunday Morning's - 8:30am\n\nESPN2 and SIRIUS Radio - Wimbledon - 8am\n\nABC, Univision and XM Radio - World Cup - ENGLAND vs.PORTUGAL- 11am\n\nNBC and SIRIUS Radio - Wimbledon - Noon\n\nFOX and XM Radio - Mets - Yankeees - 1pm\n\nESPN, Univision and XM Radio - World Cup - Brazil vs. France - 2:55pm\n\nABC and XM Radio - PGA Buick Open - 3pm\n\nNBC - Women's US Open - 3pm\n\nESPN2 and SIRIUS Radio - Wimbledon - 3pm\n\nESPN2 - MLS New York @ New England - 6pm\n\nSpeed and XM Radio - Daytona Pepsi 400 Pre Race Show - 6:30pm\n\nMASN and WTWP - Tampa Bay vs. The Nationals - 7pm\n\nCh. 50\/TBS and WTEM Baltimore vs. Atlanta - 7pm\n\nCSN - CFL Football - Edmonton @ Winnipeg - 7pm\n\nFOX and XM Radio - The Pepsi 400 - 7:30pm\n\nNo comments:",
