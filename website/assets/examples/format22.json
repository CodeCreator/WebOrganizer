Here is an article to help you get started.\n\nAn internet home based business is probably one of the easiest and most inexpensive to set-up. If you want to set-up your very own online business, you can do so anytime without having to go through the complications involved in offline businesses. If you start setting up your own Internet home based business now, you will surely be surprised of how easy it is than you may have initially imagined it to be.\n\nThe first and most obvious step in building your Internet home based business is to choose a product to sell. The best products to sell today are those that are electronic in nature and can be easily delivered through the Internet. This can be an eBook, audio format, software or a video. To maximize potential profits, make sure that you have an interesting and unique product which will catch the attention of your target audience. It is also best to go for a product which is generally popular, or is promising enough to be popular to your target market.\n\nOnce you have decided on a certain product or products to sell, your next step is to create a site where you will sell your product on. Your site will be very important in your Internet home based business. It will be best if you can register a domain name that fits your product the most. You should also find a reliable yet affordable web host to make it easy for you to manage your site. If you have good website design skills, make a site that is neither too flashy nor graphic laden. What you want is a site that is appealing, yet not too overt to turn off potential customers.\n\nYou need to make sure that everything about your site is quick and easy to use. Your payment processor should be set in place. It might be best to go for payment channels such as PayPal as it is free and easy to set-up. In the same way, your Internet home based business site should also feature a product delivery that is automatic and instant. Not only will this be best for your customers, but this can also save you time as you will not need to email the product or send a download link after payment has been made.\n\nThe content of your site will have a big contribution to the success of your Internet home based business. You have to come up with an attractive heading that will instantly catch your viewer's attention. More importantly, your site should contain detailed information on the product that you are selling. You can ask for feedback from previous customers and put them as testimonials and endorsements.\n\nIt will also be a great idea to drive traffic into your site through proper keyword research and search engine optimization. Joining discussion forums, article marketing and social bookmarking are also all equally effective means to market your product to the rest of the world. Remember that the success of any Internet home based business goes as far as its accessibility to its target customers. So, bank on a good product and market effectively.\nAbout the Author\nExperience how it is like to earn big money within the comforts of your home through the Internet.

Don\u2019t even get me started on my pantry project\u2026\n\nInstead of purging old condiment jars and bottles, repurpose with a bit of paint to transform them into bud vases in sweet shades of trendy emerald green. It\u2019s the perfect seasonal display to update a mantle, kitchen table, nightstand, or windowsill.\n\nThis post was another commissioned piece for THIS magazine.\n\n  \u2022 For bottles:\u00a0jam jar, soda bottles, vinegar bottle, syrup bottle. For paint:\u00a0Olympic in A62a and A62b (shades of emerald), $2.99 each, Lowe\u2019s. For syringe:\u00a0Lowe\u2019s, complimentary, ask clerk. For flowers:\u00a0Spray Roses, $5.99, Trader Joe\u2019s.\n\n\n  \u2022 prep \u2013 begin by washing all bottles and let dry completely (overnight).\u00a01 withdraw paint using a paint syringe. 2 insert syringe into bottle opening and dispense a stream of paint.\u00a0 3 with the bottle lying horizontal, slowly rotate to evenly cover entire inside surface of the bottle.\u00a0 4 pour remaining paint back into jar.\u00a0 5\u00a0 remove excess paint from bottle mouth using a paper towel, dampened with water if needed. 6 let jars rest upright for 3 \u2013 4 hours. repeat steps 4 and 5 one more time. let jars rest overnight until completely dried. 7 fill a disposable floral vile with water (do not put water directly into bottles \u2013 as the paint will wash away). 8 insert flowers into plastic vile and arrange inside bottle(s) of choice. display in any place that needs a touch of spring beauty!\n\n\n13 Responses to Purge into Pretty\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Your IP: Unknown \u00b7 Your Status: ProtectedUnprotectedUnknown\nBlog How-To\n\nHow to use a public computer safely\n\nUsing a public computer is becoming less common. However, imagine needing to access your work emails or your social media accounts \u2013 and your laptop\u2019s at home and your phone just died.\n\nEmily Green\n\nEmily Green\n\nJan 22, 2017 \u00b7 3 min read\n\nHow to use a public computer safely\n\nA public computer would be a reasonable choice, but it\u2019s risky. Did you know that it could put your private information at risk? Using a public computer presents similar threats as using public Wi-Fi (find out how to stay safe on public Wi-Fi). That\u2019s why we put together a few tips that will help you protect your data and use a public computer safely.\n\n1: Delete downloaded files\n\nIf you need to download anything to a public computer (i.e. your flight tickets or your booking confirmations), always make sure to delete these files and empty the Recycle Bin. It\u2019s even better to use memory stick for your files. Instead of saving downloads on the computer, just save them on your USB.\n\n2: Delete your browser history\n\nHow to use a public computer safely? Right after you\u2019ve finished browsing, delete all of your history, cookies, and temporary Internet files. Usually, you can do this by clicking \u2018History\u2019 or \u2018Privacy\u2019 tabs on your browser. If you\u2019re using Chrome, click on the three-dash icon on the upper right-hand corner and select \u2018History\u2019. From here, it\u2019s easy to clear your browsing data. For Firefox, go to \u2018Settings\u2019, click on \u2018Privacy & Security\u2019, and then choose \u2018Clear private data\u2019.\n\n3: Don\u2019t save passwords\n\nIf you need to access a website that requires your login details and\/or your password, never click \u2018remember me\u2019 or \u2018save password\u2019. This might seem obvious, but most people are so used to clicking these buttons that they automatically do so on public computers. If you do accidentally end up saving your password, don\u2019t panic. You can delete this information too.\n\n4: Don\u2019t enter highly sensitive information\n\nA public computer is not the best place to check your bank account or shop online, nor should you use it with your work network. Not only could hackers compromise your credentials, they could also get into your work network and access your company\u2019s information. The same goes for sensitive personal data, like bank account logins or anything that requires your government ID information.\n\n5: Restart the computer\n\nOne way to make sure that your private information is safe is to restart your computer when you\u2019re done with it. The next guy in line may not like it, but it might save you from a massive headache. Restarting your computer will not only clear out temporary files, it will also clear the public computer\u2019s physical memory (RAM).\n\n6: Apply the same security rules as you would at home\n\nJust because you are using a public computer doesn\u2019t mean that you should use the internet carelessly. You should still avoid accessing unknown websites or downloading suspicious files. (If you are unsure how to avoid bad internet behaviors or how to fix them, check out this post.\n\n7: Don\u2019t forget to sign out\n\nYou would be surprised to see how many people forget to sign out of their accounts. Make sure you don\u2019t , because the next person to use the computer might accidentally open your account. Don\u2019t leave your data in the hands of a stranger.\n\n8: Watch your surroundings\n\nWatch what\u2019s happening around you. Pay attention. Is someone looking over your shoulder? How about security cameras? Someone might be snooping over you in the physical world and collecting your data.\n\n9: Use your common sense\n\nLastly, you should always use your common sense. Keep an eye out for things that might feel odd. For example, if your connection speed suddenly drops, that might mean that someone is leaking your data. If in doubt, it\u2019s better to disconnect the internet, or at least to avoid visiting websites that ask for your personal information. Use a public computer safely and you won't get into any trouble.\n\nOnline security starts with a click.\n\nStay safe with the world\u2019s leading VPN",

It's got a feeling of solidness that makes you want to rub the steering wheel and pat the shift knob, just sit there and appreciate the cabin's elegance.\n\nEpcp_0901_01_z+volkswagen_r32+side_view Photo 2\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 HRE Type C90 Wheels & Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 - Volkswagen R32 Project\n\nIn truth, the R32 is pretty damn complete, lacking for nothing save fuel. As usual, we found ourselves wondering if this would be the shortest project car we'd ever done.\n\nIf we had to adhere to a school, it would be the OE+ school of modification. Ideally, it needs to appear as if it's been assembled with factory hot rod parts built by craftsman after hours, you know, for kicks.\n\nShort of having a key to VW's workshop, we assembled a smattering of gear that follow the aforementioned parameters.\n\nEpcp_0901_03_z+volkswagen_r32+front_view Photo 3\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 HRE Type C90 Wheels & Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 - Volkswagen R32 Project\n\nHRE Type C90 Wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport PS2\nThe wheel industry is a fairly polarized place. At one end are great wheels, the other, crap. There are a few stratified through the middle but only a handful would pass stringent TUV and Euro-Union standards.\n\nWe've known of HRE Wheels for nearly 15 years, admired their work on Porsches, Lamborghinis BMW's, Audis, Vipers, etc. Every year at the SEMA show in Las Vegas we tend to hang around their booth too long, usually fondling whatever new design HRE has introduced that year.\n\nRather than typical sales people, you find yourself speaking with engineers, the guys that actually designed the wheels and know them from the alloy up. These guys deal in fact rather than marketing fantasy. We like that.\n\nEpcp_0901_05_z+ecs+crankshaft_pully Photo 4\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 HRE Type C90 Wheels & Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 - Volkswagen R32 Project\n\nWe chose HRE's C90 wheels for their classic multi-spoke styling, two-piece design and solid construction. While the R32 is capable of running 19-in gear, the decision to retain 18-in rims was based on the fact that more tire means more protection to the wheel. However, should we injure the HREs, we could simply order another outer section rather than a whole new wheel.\n\nLike all HRE wheels, the C90s reek of quality, right down to the fasteners holding them together. And while the outer face of the wheels looks fantastic, the inside is just as beautiful. Every surface and each curve has been optimized for strength and lightness, neither bowing to the other but rather striking a perfect balance. That pretty much sums up HRE's product-balanced performance.\n\nNo, the C90s ain't cheap but neither is the forging technology that created them. Moreover, the C90s provide a classic look that should serve this car or any other that one day may wear them.\n\nEpcp_0901_06_z+techtonic+lifts Photo 5\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 HRE Type C90 Wheels & Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 - Volkswagen R32 Project\n\nMeasuring 18x8.5\" ET30 with a 5x100 bolt pattern, the C90s have been wrapped with Michelin's exceptional Pilot Sport PS2 tires. We managed to get 255\/35ZR-18s under the fender wells, leaving this R32 extremely well-tired. Switching the generic rubber for the Michelins was like substituting standard craft paste (the kind we ate in school) for Cyanoacrylate adhesive. The original tires were some off brand we'd never heard of and in truth, they were fun. The R32 slid all over the place like a rally car. With the PS2s, it doesn't budge. The car feels much more centered and cornering is very sharp.\n\nThere's not much we can add to what's already been said of the Michelin PS2. They are perhaps the best performance tires in the world, blending huge grip with outstanding road manners and decent wet performance.\n\nPower Program\nWe are huge fans of VW's narrow angle six. Both robust and powerful, it responds well to normally aspirated enhancements.\n\nEpcp_0901_07_z+giac+flashloader Photo 6\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 HRE Type C90 Wheels & Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 - Volkswagen R32 Project\n\nThis first round includes hardware designed to enhance the car's respiration. We replaced the airbox with Eurosport's ITG Intake featuring its oil-impregnated element, heavy-duty fittings and heat shield. A Tectonics' exhaust replaced the heavy factory system, an impressive piece of work with great build quality and excellent fit and finish. It's augmented with Tectonics' own breed of camshaft wrought from stainless steel billets, ground in house and then chill-hardened. A gem-like underdrive pulley from ECS Tuning and GIAC software complete the program.\n\nThe summation of these bolt-on parts was a substantial increase in engine performance and tonality. Baseline power figures showed the R32 produced 218 whp (measure at the front wheels via Haldex switching). The car was now making 244 and the sound coming from the polished tips of the TT exhaust is simply glorious.\n\nEpcp_0901_04_z+volkswagen_r32+full_view Photo 7\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 HRE Type C90 Wheels & Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 - Volkswagen R32 Project\n\nFor and up-close look at this install, go to Get to the \"project car\" section. We can only say how good it sounds so many times. You've gotta see and hear this thing to believe it.\n\nHRE Wheels\nCrystalline Clear\n\u2022While your cars wheels may not seem like the most complex component, manufacturing a high quality aftermarket wheel isn't nearly as easy as one may think. Wheels are subjected to complex loading from drive and braking torque, side loading from cornering and radial loads from the car's own weight and magnified by road irregularities.\n\nEpcp_0901_10_z+hre+wheel Photo 8\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 HRE Type C90 Wheels & Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 - Volkswagen R32 Project\n\nOnce you have optimized the design, you need to figure out how to build it. You wont find any cast wheels coming out of HRE, they just don't have the required consistency or strength. All the hunks of aluminum coming out of HRE have been forged. The centers start life as a piece of 7-inch billet of 6061 that is mashed into shape with pressure, not heat. Think Play-Doh fun factory just shinier. Forging allows the crystalline grain structure of the Aluminum to orient itself in the direction of the spokes, optimizing strength. The centers are then heated treated to a T6 Temper before being CNC machined entirely in-house.\n\nThe rim halves start as sheets of 6061 aluminum that are spun forged on a lathe. Think of a pottery wheel except instead of clay a giant sheet of aluminum that will slice off appendages or entire limbs. The spin forging aligns the structure in circumferential grain to maximize the hoop strength of the rims. Once the spin forging is completed they are brought to the same T6 temper as the halves. The inner mating surfaces of the wheel halves are then machined to make sure they are perfectly flat to match the centers and the holes for the fasteners are then drilled. The bolt-holes have to be incredibly precise for they determine concentricity of the final wheel. A slight mistake in drilling can turn your high-end European sports machine into a Teutonic paint shaker.\n\nEpcp_0901_08_z+techtonics+exhaust Photo 9\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 HRE Type C90 Wheels & Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 - Volkswagen R32 Project\n\nOnce all the components are individually completed, each wheel is hand assembled using quite literally the highest-grade fasteners they can find. Most HRE receive full stainless fasteners from legendary ARP. For higher-end applications where weight is an absolute priority, HRE offers titanium fasteners. The super light and strong Ti fasteners are actually sourced from a German manufacturer that also supplies Airbus. Most modular wheel manufacturers out there are using chromed steel. The stainless ARP fasteners are roughly four times the cost of chromed steel while the titanium is actually twenty times the price of steel. This may sound extreme, but standing in the middle of HRE's factory filled with the best CNC equipment, with the highest quality control in place, holding a high-priced, German made titanium fastener makes total sense.-Michael Febbo\n\nEpcp_0901_09_z+eurosport+intake Photo 10\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 HRE Type C90 Wheels & Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 - Volkswagen R32 Project\nBy Staff\n130 Articles\n\n\n\n\nGetting the lowdown with air suspension and new wheels\nMichael FebboOct 18, 2014\nNew parts and accessories for your driving life.\nSep 19, 2014\nFundamental parts guide for your FR-S\/BRZ\nSep 12, 2014\nLightSpeed Automotive Technology introduces a trick gauge unit that's sure to get any tech-savvy enthusiast's blood pumping.\nScott TsuneishiSep 12, 2014\nWhether you're welding steel or even aluminum, Miller's got the perfect welder for you.\nScott TsuneishiSep 12, 2014",

What fun!\n\nIt's best to be organized and as relaxed as you can. First, decide on the date, location, and budget. Keep the party short--an hour and a half to two hours is long enough for this age--and limit the number of guests. Three to five children are plenty.\n\nAway from Home\nA party outside the house eliminates a lot of mess. Make sure the establishment can accommodate very young children and their parents--at this age most children insist that their parents stay with them.\n\nAt Home\nParties at home are exciting for the child. He or she can help decorate and prepare. If the weather permits, have the party outside.\n\nExtra Help\nConsider hiring someone to help out, such as a favorite cousin or neighbor who can set up games and serve food. Very young children need constant attention and help. Book this helper a month in advance and make sure he or she arrives well before and stays well after the party. Go to FamilyTime Calendar .\n\nWith their short attention spans, young children need only one or two activities. Fill up the remaining time with food and free play.\n\n  \u2022 Musical chairs, duck-duck-goose, and simple relay races.\n  \u2022 Read a story or two (the birthday boy's or girl's favorite).\n  \u2022 Hire a magician or clown. Ask him to keep the show short and simple. Some young children are afraid of clowns--find out if this might be an issue.\n  \u2022 A simple treasure hunt or candy hunt (similar to an Easter egg hunt).\n\nIf you want to serve lunch, stick with small, plain sandwiches--jelly, chicken salad, tuna, pizza, or chicken nuggets. Buy or bake a cake and have no more than two ice cream flavors to choose from. Serve the meal halfway through the party to give the children a rest and provide focus. Go to FamilyTime Recipes.\n\nMatching, colorful paper products dress up the table and make cleanup a snap. Use plastic spoons and forks. Have plenty of paper towels on hand for spills. Fill paper cups only halfway with juice or soda. Lay a plastic mat under the table for easy cleanup.\n\nFill \"goodie bags\" with sturdy plastic toys, stickers, and a few pieces of candy. Very small objects, balloons, and chewing gum can be choking hazards.\n\nEnter your email address to receive delicious, family-friendly recipes, exciting promotions, helpful articles and more delivered right to your mailbox.
