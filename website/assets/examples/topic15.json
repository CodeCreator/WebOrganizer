Then came the need for a loader tractor whereupon a second hand fully refurbished 4 cylinder 880 Implematic with AL2 front loader, bucket and fork was purchased in 1969. That tractor did many years trouble free service, cleaning out dung every spring from the covered yard that the cows over wintered in and was 5 feet deep and took several days to clean out. It also did a lot of field work and loading bales with a Lawrence Edwards 'Perry Loader'. This tractor broke a crank whilst rolling ploughed ground one day and was then, as it was, traded back for an 885 VQ with L8 power loader, fork and bucket in 1976, it was only 2 years old and that one was used until 1997 when I gave up milking and replaced with an E plate 1394 with QD90 loader. In 1978 we bought a brand new 995 VQ2 trading back the 880 Selectamatic that was by this time well worn out. The 995 was replaced in 1995 with a Second hand 1983 1394 which was kept until 1996 when sold on privateley and replaced with a much cheaper to buy, a 1983 1490 2wd which I still have. The 1394 and QD90 loader was sold when I started letting my land out. I still needed a handy loader tractor and found privateley a pre-Q 1212 with L12 front loader and bought in 1998 a very low hours 1294 on a B plate. These tractors, the 1212, 1294 and 1490 I still have. So, that's continuous David Brown tractor use on the same farm from March 1961 to date, 51 years.\n\nUser avatar\nPosts: 41\nJoined: Mon May 16, 2011 10:44 am\nLocation: Oldham Lancahire\n\nRE: 62 years of DB\n\nPost by philipday \u00bb Sun May 13, 2012 3:16 pm\n\nMy father bought his first DB 950 in 1960\/61 straight from DB's London Showroom where it had spent two years impressing foreign dignatories.

        "text":"Wednesday, 30 April 2014\n\nPotos\u00ed - In the Silver Mines\n\n\nIt's amazing how Potosi, at over 4000m out in the middle of the altiplano was one of the richest and largest cities in the world several hundred years ago. \u00a0Why? \u00a0The big hill behind the town, the Cerro Rica (Rich Hill) was the source for the bulk of the silver production in the Spanish empire from the mid 1500s on. \u00a0The hill is completely perforated with mazes of interconnected mine tunnels and shafts, and is even a few hundred metres shorter than it initially was, for all the ore extracted!\n\nThe mining continues today not too differently to how it was done for the last 400 years - it's all manual work. \u00a0Health and safety is pretty much absent, and miners seldom live past\u00a0their\u00a0forties for\u00a0all the toxic\u00a0environments\u00a0and accidents. \u00a0They go in with picks and\u00a0shovels and the odd stick of dynamite - and come out with bags full of rocks. \u00a0Some more successful miners from the cooperatives have wheelbarrows - or even Indiana Jones style wagons that roll at shocking speeds silently through the tunnels. \u00a0Watch out!\n\nIt was an excellent opportunity to get to go into the mines, first seeing the processing plants then plunging into the mountain with just a head torch and wellies.\n\nThe tunnels themselves are tiny, crumbling, wet and of course completely dark. \u00a0Too often the wooden supports would fail - and at one point we had to negotiate our way around the rubble of a partial collapse. \u00a0The air was both thin (at 4400 metres) and rancid - with the weird chemical stench constricting ones lungs even more. \u00a0The miner guide assured us that we'd not suffocate from Carbon Monoxide - but that it was just the smell of the Arsenic and Cyanide. Great.\n\nFascinating bursts of intricately shapes minerals would appear in seams, as well as odd goopy-looking\u00a0stalagmites\u00a0of slime. \u00a0I didn't touch\u00a0anything! \u00a0It really felt a bit like a dungeons and dragons dungeon (It was on my mind seeing as I'd just finished Ultima IV on an Apple \/\/e emulator - 29 years after I started!) especially as out of\u00a0nowhere\u00a0miners would appear and gruffly shuffle\u00a0past. \u00a0It was an amazing experience - but it wiped me out!\n\nLater that night I got slammed with altitude sickness - all that exertion at 4400m was no good at all for my body. \u00a0I felt like hell laying in bed, but a couple of kittens came up out of nowhere to keep me company - which helped immediately.\n\nI didn't know how I felt about going into the mines at first. I was interested in finding out about the mining and especially the working conditions of the miners. However, I didn't want to expose myself to the dire conditions, especially the noxious fumes, and I did think that the tour would be a bit voyeuristic. In the end I am glad I went on the tour. I think it is important to see exactly where our minerals come from and the conditions that people go through to get them. \u00a0It was also fascinating to see El Tio- the devil of the mines, who brings the workers more minerals and protects them and who they offer 96% sugar cane alcohol, coca leaves and cigarettes to. I was also glad when it was over and I was out into the light. Being inside a mine at 4400m when you have not fully acclimatised to the altitude is hard going and altitude sickness is no fun at all.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Home \u00bb NEWS \u00bb Economic Development \u00bb More state farmers favoring peanut crops\n\nMore state farmers favoring peanut crops\n\nPeanuts, long associated with the states of Georgia and Virginia, are gaining favor among Mississippi farmers who are adding the nuts in rotation with their more traditional crops.\n\nBack in the 1940s it was common for Mississippi farmers to plant peanuts but they disappeared for the most part until a comeback began in 2005.\n\nDon Self, a cotton farmer in Hamilton, was among the first to plant peanuts in the northeastern part of the state. He credits Dan West for planting the first significant peanut crop in the state. The Self family of farmers followed in 2007. Now Self rotates peanuts with cotton and corn.\n\n\u201cPeanuts revitalized farming for us in our area,\u201d said Self, who is active in peanut business circles. He is Mississippi\u2019s first representative on the National Peanut Board and also is a member of the Mississippi Peanut Growers Association.\n\npeanutsMalcolm Broome is executive director of the state Peanut Growers Association. He is a retired MSU agronomist who worked with Mississippi farmers during his career through the MSU Extension Service.\n\nBroome said that after a drought in Georgia, the largest peanut producer by far, supply and demand kicked in. When the price was high, everybody got in. Mississippi doubled its peanut acres to 50,000 \u201cand everybody else did too.\u201d That\u2019s when the price went down, he said. This year acreage has dropped to 29,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s year to year, like a yo-yo,\u201d Broome said. \u201cIt\u2019s something the industry is working on to try to get leveled out.\u201d\n\nRight now, Mississippi is seventh in the nation in acres of peanuts. The state is ranked first or second in yield per acre, about two tons on average, he said. Success with the crop has added jobs in the Delta, Broome said.\n\nOne economic boost comes from large companies that have bought old facilities including a cotton gin and boat plant for peanut storage. \u201cWe now have four delivery points in Mississippi,\u201d Broome said, \u201cincluding two of the largest peanut warehouses in the nation.\u201d They each can hold 25,000 tons.\n\nBroome said farming peanuts is very labor intensive and expensive to begin with.\n\n\u201cYou need at least 300 acres to make it a profitable venture,\u201d he said. And farming them requires a special combine and other tools that farmers have to invest in. About the only piece of equipment that can be used for peanuts and other crops is a tractor.\n\nOn the up side, Self said peanut consumption is increasing every year. He likes to spread the word about the nutritional benefits of peanuts as a cheap source of protein. \u201cPeople are just finding out that peanuts have 30 essential vitamins and nutrients, no transfat, seven grams of protein per one-ounce serving, that they\u2019re good and good for you.\u201d\n\nOf the four types of peanuts grown in a swath from Virginia, across the South and into the Southwest, 80 percent of the most common runner variety goes into peanut butter and candy bars. The Virginia peanut is the familiar in-the-shell ball park treat, the Valencia peanut is the boiling variety and the red-husked Spanish peanut is served by the bowlful at bars everywhere.\n\nSelf can attest to the nail biting aspect of peanut farming but he said peanuts fit in to Mississippi farming very well. \u201cIt\u2019s a great nitrogen booster for the soil, it prospers well and it\u2019s a great rotation crop.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, the last few years have been a roller coaster with prices going up and down.\n\n\u201cMy daddy (Dennis) is 79 years old. I told him if we can survive this learning curve, it will be good.
