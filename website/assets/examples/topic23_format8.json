In special cases, the hotel may offer a guest accommodation other than that which has been arranged, if it does not differ in any essential manner from that which was stipulated in the confirmed booking.\n\n4. On the basis of a booking confirmation the hotel is obliged to accommodate a guest from 2.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. and it is obliged to reserve the room for the guest up to this time unless the booking stipulates otherwise.\n\n5. The hotel may offer guests who ask to extend their stay a different room to the one in which they were originally accommodated.\n\n6.

Guests are allowed to use their rooms for the agreed period. If the period of accommodation is not stipulated in advance, guests have to check out by 12.00 p.m. on the last day of their stay at the latest, and they are obliged to move out by this time. If a guest fails to do this, the hotel has the right to bill him\/her for another day\u2019s stay. In case when hotel has already reserved this room beforehand, and the guest fails to comply with the rules above, or if he\/she is not present in the hotel, the hotel reserves the right to store guest\u2019s stuff in a safe place so that this room can be used by another guest for whom it has been reserved.\n\n9. A guest may only invite visitors with the consent of the appropriate hotel employee during the period from 8.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m. upon registering this visit in the visitors\u2019 book at the reception area.\n\n10.

To ensure that all our guests, our neighbours and future guests have the best possible experience, we have a few simple house rules.\n\nNo smoking in the apartment\n\n\nAll our properties are Non-\u00adsmoking. As a kind measure to future guests, if you do smoke, please ensure you do so outside and then dispose of the cigarette butt thoughtfully.\n\nPlease be mindful of your noise\n\nWe don\u2019t expect our guests to be silent, however, as a lot of our apartments are in blocks of apartments, sound can travel a long way, so please be mindful of your noise level and respectful to others around you, particularly in the evening.\n\nNo Parties\n\nOK, so in this case we are party poopers! Out of respect to our guests and neighbours, our properties are not available to hold parties and we will not tolerate them. If you wish to hold a party, we politely advise you to go somewhere else.\n\nNo Pets\n\nWe\u2019re huge pet lovers at Ravens House Sapphire Apartments however we recognise and respect that some people are not or could be allergic to them, so we kindly ask you to refrain from bringing your beloved pets into any of our properties.\n\nNo Illegal activities\n\nWhether it is providing a \u2018personal\u2019 service, or selling illegal substances, we do not tolerate any illegal activity, and will prosecute if this is ignored. If we suspect this is happening at any time during your stay we will ask you to leave the premises immediately, there will be no refund and we will make an admin charge.\n\nTreat our team with respect\n\nWe hope you share our belief that everyone has the right to be treated with respect. However if we hear any reports of any form of abuse towards any member of our team, you will be asked to leave.\n\nWe want every guest to experience that wonderful clean feeling when they walk into a Ravens House Sapphire Apartments property, which is why we kindly ask that you leave the property in a reasonably tidy condition when you depart. Don\u2019t worry, we don\u2019t expect you to do the dusting, just please avoid leaving spillages on the carpet, or beer splattered on the walls, make sure the furniture is left where you found it and please do the washing up before you go. Thank you.\n\nInterim clean for longer stays\n\nIf your stay is for longer than a couple of weeks our cleaning team will pop round to freshen the property up for you. We\u2019ll agree a convenient time with you to carry out this interim clean. After all, we pride ourselves on ensuring our properties are maintained to the highest standard for all our guests. You included!\n\n\nWe all know that accidents happen and things may go missing from time to time. We kindly ask you to report any breakages\/faulty appliances etc. as soon as possible via our website help@rhsa.uk , or by phoning our helpdesk, so they can be fixed as soon as possible. We\u2019re very friendly, and we won\u2019t tell you off!\n\n\nWe hope that all our guests respect our properties and furniture, however sometimes this is not the case. If there is excessive damage to a property, its equipment or furniture, we reserve the right to charge for the repair\/replacement, plus an admin charge. If, however, you find something that is broken during your stay, please let us know by email help@rhsa.uk or by calling our help desk. We will not charge you if it was an accident and you have notified us about the problem.\n\n\nWhere we use physical keys to access the apartment, please leave them where you found them from on your arrival, when you leave. If you lose your key during your stay, or don\u2019t leave it behind when you leave, then we will make an admin charge to replace it. If you later return it, we will refund half of this charge.\n\nSofa Beds and Cots\n\nPlease notify your helpdesk team by phone or email help@rhsa.uk before your stay should you require linen for the sofa bed or (if available) if you require a cot, so that we can have your room set up correctly ahead of your arrival.\n\nAdditional Charges\n\nWe hope you agree that these house rules are there to ensure all our guests have a pleasant stay. However, in the case where the House Rules aren\u2019t adhered to, we reserve the right to make additional charges and in extreme cases we will ask you to vacate the property immediately with no refund given.\n\nSmoking within the property: \u00a3650 Cleaning & Admin charge\n\nExcessive damage to the property: Cost of repair or replace + \u00a3300 Admin charge\n\nIllegal activities: \u00a31000 Admin Charge\n\nLost Key: \u00a350 Admin Charge\n\nExtra Cleaning (e.g Washing up): \u00a350 Cleaning Charge\n\nParting words\u2026\n\nWe wish you a very pleasant stay within your property and hope you find everything you need to ensure your experience is comfortable and accommodating.
