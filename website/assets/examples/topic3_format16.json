        "text":"Los Angeles Felony Defense Attorney\n\nHow Does a Felony Differ from a Misdemeanor?\n\nIn the state of California, and throughout the rest of the United States, a felony is any crime that is punishable by death or imprisonment in state prison. All other crimes or public offenses are treated as misdemeanors, which carry a maximum of one year in county jail. Furthermore, most felony convictions will result in collateral consequences like the loss of your professional license, the loss of your right to own firearms, loss of employment and the inability to hold office or serve as a juror.\n\nIn California, certain felonies must be served in county jail if it is so specified in the new sentencing program, the Criminal Justice Realignment Act of 2011.\n\nSerious Charges Require a Serious Defense\n\nIf you have been charged with a felony offense in California, it is important to understand what you are up against. At best, you may receive formal probation with little to no jail time; however, in the worst case scenario, the consequences may include a lifetime behind bars in state prison. You could also lose your professional license, your job and your right to own a firearm. If you are not a citizen of the United States, you could also face deportation. For this reason, you will need an aggressive defense.\n\nThe Los Angeles criminal lawyers at Stephen G. Rodriguez & Partners have been defending the rights of criminally accused clients for more than 70 years combined. When you work with us, we will stand by you throughout every step of the process, thoroughly review the evidence against you, and do everything in our power to secure a favorable resolution on your behalf. We know just how damaging a felony conviction can be, so you can trust that we will work diligently to protect your freedom.\n\nTypes of Felony Offenses in California\n\nWhile most felonies include some element of violence, you do not necessarily have to commit a violent crime in order to be charged with a felony. For example, you could be charged with a felony if you are arrested for shoplifting and you have a prior conviction on your record. Shoplifting would otherwise be charged as a misdemeanor.\n\nSome of the most common felonies in California include:\n\n  \u2022 White collar crimes \u2013 bribery, fraud, forgery, perjury, embezzlement, etc.\n  \u2022 Drug crimespossession, sales, manufacturing, distribution, etc.\n  \u2022 Sex crimessexual abuse, sexual assault, possession of child porn, etc.\n  \u2022 Violent crimesmurder, manslaughter, kidnapping, arson, mayhem, etc.\n  \u2022 Theft crimes burglary, armed robbery, grand theft, carjacking, etc.\n\nHow the \"Three Strikes Law\" Can Affect Sentencing\n\nBeing convicted of a felony offense anywhere in the United States can result in harsh penalties; however, California's three strikes law can make a felony conviction particularly devastating. This law, which is commonly referred to as the \"three strikes and you're out\" law, requires repeat felony offenders to serve increasingly severe sentences with each subsequent offense. In fact, someone who is convicted of their third serious or violent felony will automatically face 25 years to life.\n\n  \u2022 If you already have one strike on your record and you are convicted of another serious felony in the state, you will automatically face a doubled prison sentence and triple the amount of time in actual custody\u2014due to the law's reduction of good behavior credit.\n  \u2022 If you already have two strikes on your record and you are convicted of a third felony in the state (even if it is not considered a strike), the \"three strikes law\" will come into full effect\u2014meaning that you will automatically be required to serve 25 years to life in prison.\n\nUnder California Penal Code \u00a7 666, someone who has previously been convicted of three theft offenses could face felony penalties if they commit another theft-related crime. This means that a \"two strikes\" defendant who has been charged with a new misdemeanor shoplifting offense could have their charges upgraded to a felony\u2014and, thus, face 25 years to life in prison under the three strikes law.\n\nDeterminate & Indeterminate Sentencing in Felony Cases\n\nIf you are convicted of a felony offense in the state of California, you could either face a determinate sentence or an indeterminate sentence\u2014the difference being that a determinate sentence is a set term of imprisonment and an indeterminate sentence is a variable term, such as a term of life in prison. However, most felonies are punishable under the determinate sentencing laws in California. This means that the judge can impose one of three prison terms: a low, middle or high term of imprisonment.\n\nFor example, robbery is punishable by a low term of two years, a middle term of four years and a high term of six years. The judge will usually impose a middle-of-the-road sentence, but their decision will be influenced by several different factors\u2014including their own discretion, the seriousness of the crime, the defendant's criminal record and other mitigating and aggravating factors. Indeterminate sentencing is reserved for particularly serious felonies like murder, kidnapping, rape and aggravated mayhem.\n\nWhy are some crimes called \"wobblers\" in California?\n\nIn California, there are a number of different crimes that are considered to be \"wobblers\"\u2014meaning that they could either be charged as a misdemeanor or felony. When expungement or sentencing hangs in the balance over the status of a wobbler, it is imperative that you enlist the help of an experienced criminal attorney in Los Angeles, CA. When Stephen G. Rodriguez & Partners is on your case, we may be able to tip the scales of justice in favor of a misdemeanor to potentially minimize your penalties.\n\nSome of the most common wobblers in California include:\n\nDon't Let a Felony Conviction Ruin Your Life\n\nEven if you face the lightest possible sentencing for a felony conviction, this permanent mark on your criminal record could still have lasting consequences. Not only could it limit your housing and employment opportunities, but it could put a strain on your personal relationships and quality of life. For this reason, you shouldn't wait any longer to retain the help of a Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer at Stephen G. Rodriguez & Partners if you or someone you love has been arrested for a felony crime.\n\nIn 2003, 68% of the adults who were arrested in the state were convicted of their charges. With this number in mind, it is important to remember that choosing the right criminal defense attorney can make all of the difference in the outcome of your case. When you work with our firm, you can rest easier knowing that we are backed by both client satisfaction and a proven record of successful results.

Also, the sessions are quick and can be intended to fit into your bustling calendar. The procedure doesn\u2019t need to disturb the ordinary family normal. The people involved can accelerate the process when they wish not to like court systems where one needs to confer and adhere to the rules thoroughly.

Mediation, on the other hand, happens in a discrete area including just the vital people.\n\n(5) Mediation can non-partisan to particular issues.\n\nSome of the time the issue can be a specific something, and mediation can be centred around a particular problem. Whether it is where the children will go to school and where they will live. Intervention can help tackle such an issue with accuracy. Mediation also manages the residence orders and also contact orders. There are additionally some don\u2019ts that ought to be examined in the process called the prohibited steps order.\n\nWhat issues do we manage?\n\nMediation can help all individuals from a family, resolve challenges about property, different belonging, fund, business, obligations and parental access rights. At times intercession includes just the two people in a troublesome relationship however different circumstances is required by grownups, guardians and their grown-up children or grandparents as well.\n\nEarly anticipating upkeep and also child support payments courses of action following a division can help evade later issues, while the contribution of a free gathering in dialogues about the group of property or different resources and even obligations can smooth advance.\n\nHow Mediation Gateshead is helpful.\n\nFamily mediation Gateshead can change a troubled relationship ending into a fresh start. Family intercession administrations are fundamentally implied for people who were once fulfilled and content with their lives however then because of a startling unforeseen development, they entered a descending winding and appear to have no chance to get out. This sort of administration can be characterised as an elective debate determination method which is intended to be utilised by people who are encountering issues with their relatives.\n\nDuring the procedure, the people will have the capacity to have secret correspondence and achieve a shared understanding through the help of a family middle person, who is a non-partisan individual. Fundamentally, the mediator goes about as an unbiased to keep the lines of correspondence clear between the people involved and also illuminating legal problems emerging simultaneously.\n\nThe conclusion.\n\nMediation is for the most part for peacefully settling the conflict. Our mediation services can likewise be utilised to deal with issues like pet assignment, appearance rights, the welfare of the sick relative\u2019s et cetera. An ordinary intercession session goes on for a few hours. Notwithstanding, now and again the middle person may feel that that the determination isn\u2019t around the bend and more issues should be managed. In these cases, the go-between would prescribe booking further sessions to achieve the neutral arrangement.\n\nAt the point when a determination emerges amid the family intervention session and both the gatherings commonly consent to a similar then a synopsis would be set up by the family mediator who will then be introduced to a specialist to compile an understanding. The assertion will then experience lawful official and all the people included will be required to sign.\n\nIt is evident that this sort of administration is profitable because many individuals want to go for it instead of moving toward a legal counsellor or a promoter. The main advantage is that it handles touchy issues like a family conflict with extreme delicacy and secrecy. Also, our middle family people are qualified experts who have the experience as well as the aptitude required to complete the activity.\n\nLakes Mediation is entirely deliberate; it is dependent upon you as a person to accept the approach make a date, find the time and scene of the procedure.
