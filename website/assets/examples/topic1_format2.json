        "text":"May 2017\n\n- \" A Short Song on every Path...\" -\n\n\nFor a long time, I had thought that the tall birch tree between Hamfelde and Basthorst, two villages near Hamburg, would be a good a motif for me. With its lively branches dancing in the wind, this tree drew my attention whenever I passed it. On a nice day in May I painted it and then visited my friend Ute in Reinbek.\n\nLike in old student days in Berlin, prints by Gauguin, van Gogh and Paula Modersohn-Becker adorn her walls today. She loves art, literature and France as I love painting, writing and traveling through the world. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to show me your new painting?\" Ute asked whilst we sat at the beautifully laid table in her garden. Looking at my sketch book, her eyes glowed in a familiar way: \u201cAh yes, you always liked trees! I can remember exactly the big palm that you painted in our shared flat next to your tiled stove \u2013 from the floor to the ceiling.\u201d \u2013 Flashback! There it was again in front of me, my old room with the palm, the large bay windows, my hammock across the room, the many green plants, my two zebra finches, the antique desk and a certain postcard on the wall above it.\n\n\u201cYes, I remember \u2013 and now, finally, I know why I painted this birch tree!\u201d \u2013 Ute looked at me in surprise. \u201cYou still know my uncle Ernst, don\u2019t you?\u201d I began. \u201cHe taught me a vagabond song, when I was 6 or 7 years old, which I have never forgotten. And do you remember the postcard on my wall at that time, the one with the two old men under a birch tree? I bought it for myself in my first semester at university because it reminded me of this song. Yes, and when I painted this birch now, it is definitely a throwback to the postcard from way back then. A subconscious chain of association, so to speak!\u201d Ute\u2019s cheeks revealed a dimple from the left and right. \u201cYou cannot be serious,\u201d she laughed. \u201cYou've just made that up.\u201d I shrugged, put on an \u2018everything-is-possible\u2019 look \u2013 and then gave in. \u201cYes, I think you\u2019re right,\u201d I said, \u201cbut it\u2019s somehow musical, my birch tree.\u201d And then I spontaneously sang my uncle\u2019s unforgotten song to her.\n\n\n> order magnetic bookmark motif\u00a0 ' My birch tree '",

The type of loneliness I feel is not the kind that leaves your hands cold, bed empty, and lips dry - it's the kind of lonely that makes you strong. The kind of solitude that makes you appreciate yourself and think of yourself as a masterpiece. No one has seen who I really am. They have seen me in dimensions that I have chosen to reveal - but I am yet to be seen in color.\u00a0\n\nYou'll see my Danube River Blue when I use your shoulder to cry on. You'll see my pulsating red as I rage in jealousy. You'll see my cold lipped purple when we skinny dip in the\u00a0neighbor's\u00a0pool. It takes time for these colors to bleed through people, but once\u00a0they do... they leave stains on the hearts of people who see them. It's amazing what paintings your energy can create on the hearts of others.",
