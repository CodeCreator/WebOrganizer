Machine stitch these 3 long edges. I used overlock but you could use zig-zag or if you use straight stitch use a 1.5cm seam allowance and press the seams open.\n\nStep 3 - Open out the bag and refold one of the bag-base corners so that the ends of the side and bottom seams line up. Pin the 2 together with the seam allowances aligned and machine stitch 1.5 cm from the edge. Overlock, zig zag or straight stitch.

Then press and double 1cm hem along the top edge and machine stitch this is place. straight stitch.\n\nStep 8 - Pin the pocket centrally to the right side of one of the lining pieces , 9cm from the top edge. Machine stitch the pocket to the lining along the sides and bottom \u00a03mm from the fold.\n\nStep 9 - Stitch together the 2 lining pieces right sides together, exactly as you did for main bag pieces. (Steps 2 & 3)\n\nStep 10 - Press back a 4cm turning round the top of the lining.\n\nStep 11 - Slip the lining inside the bag, matching the side seams. Pin top edges together, so the lining sits just 1cm from the top edge of the bag. Slipstitch by hand the lining to the bag.\n\nand your done!\u00a0\n\nThis bag is also reversible - double bonus!\nPlease leave feedback if you use the tutorial would love to know how you get on or if you have any questions I would love to help!\nYasmin - Elizabeth\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Landscape Photography\n\nPictures in which the main subject is water, land sunset, snow, etc are all classified as landscapes. In these shots, composition is arranged in large masses, a river winding from one end of the picture to the other, several houses nestled in the hills of a Vermont village, a range of mountain tops, or a line of trees, are all typical of landscapes.\n\nWhat makes an interesting landscape photos? There should be a variation in shadow and light, and also variation in composition. A curved river in a picture is usually more exciting than a straight river, but often nicely formed trees over a serene, straight-flowing river will also make a fine pictures. A contrast between the light and dark tones of the landscape will make a better picture than one in which all objects seem to appear in the same tones of gray.\n\nPlan your composition\n\nWhen you plan your composition, watch your overall outline. Clouds, for example, form all kinds of shapes. Land, water and snow subjects also lend themselves to symbolizing emotions. Mountain peaks and tall trees seem to suggest grandeur, stateliness, dignity. Meadows, glades, brooks symbolize quietness, peacefulness and intimacy. Swamps, jungles and overgrowth often lend a feeling of confusion, mystery and fear.\n\n\nWaterfalls present freshness, force, eternity. In the desert you find vastness, emptiness, bleakness. A village scene is friendly, sturdy, pleasant. A rushing river or churning ocean suggest strength and action.\n\nWhen a picture can evoke one or more of these attitudes, this is something extra beyond the concrete composition and rendering of a landscape, you have produced an above average photograph, a photograph that people will want to see and that will be even saleable for publication. Nature offers limitless ideas, images, symbols and patterns to photograph. There is a surprising amount of order and design in nature. All we have to do is see it, for example vein in leaves, ferns, branches, trees, tree bark, flowers, spider webs, sea shells, grass, etc.\n\nTake light from all directions and take note on its quality\n\nIn photographing a landscape (or any other subjects) don't confine yourself to having the light come only from behind you. Always take note of the direction of light. As a matter of fact, it is generally better when it comes from either left or right. In this way you can achieve modeling and a roundness of forms you would otherwise miss. half of your subject is then light, and gradually the other half assumes a darker tone, which gives it distinctive form.\n\nIf the sun is behind the camera everything appears bright, but without contrast and resulted the picture to look flat. If the light is behind the subject, the subject will then appear as a silhouette or near silhouette.\nNotice how hard and brittle sunlight appears during the winter. Then observe, during the summer months, the sun's partly softness in the morning, its fullness and hardness around noon, its soft golden appearance in late afternoon and early evening. These are all changes in the \"quality\" of the light.\n\nThe quality of light also changes from day to day and hour to hour, as the sun and clouds move. At times you can even see how the changing quality of lght alters the mood of a picture from one minute to the next. This is particularly dramatic when a sunny landscape changes with the approach of black storm clouds.\n\nThe best hours for outdoor shooting\n\nGenerally the best time for taking photographs are early morning of late afternoon hours are the most favorable times for shooting landscapes. During these hours, the slanting light produces long shadows and emphasizes texture. Filters can be used to pick up clouds or to cut out haze and glare from snow scenes. A yellow filter should be used to correct blue skies or blue water; otherwise they will have little tone. Filters are not necessary with overcast skies.\nWater, sand and snow reflect more light than grass, so check your light reading carefully. Be sure the sun is low and preferably at the side, so you will get longer shadows and so that the details such as pebbles, snow flakes or water foam will be clear and sharp.\n\nMore about Camera Shooting Techniques\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2008-2019 BasicCameraPhotography.com.

        "text":"Design \/ Fashion\n\nHow to design a Ta Moko, the Maori tattoo\n\nThe Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, have a strong and long tradition of tattoos. Both men and women get tattoos, although only men receive the characteristic full face tattoos. A tattoo, or Ta Moko\u00a0represents the social status of a person, family history, tribal affiliation and even marriage eligibility. The fact that a non-Maori wants to get a Ta Moko can be a touchy subject, so the design must be well thought out to avoid offense. Swirling and geometric patterns are made to stand out, but if you seek something more personal, here are 5 steps to design your very own Ta Moko:\n\nTa Moko\n\nTa Moko\n\n1. Investigate thoroughly: disrespectful tattoos are the greatest risk for non-Maori people when they want that kind of tattoo. Since Maori tattoos are a form of identification, you should never copy an existing tattoo, cause that\u00a0would be essentially stealing an identity. As we can\u00a0see with other culturally significant body art, the chances\u00a0of getting a tattoo with a pitiful\u00a0meaning are\u00a0high if some\u00a0proper research hasn\u2019t been done previously.\n\n2. Choose the location for your tattoo: facial tattoos are the most common Maori designs. However, this might not be an eligible option for most people. The Maori also make\u00a0full body tattoos, with areas such as the back, arms and breasts decorated with spiral designs. Consider your lifestyle when choosing the place for your tattoo, and make a design somewhere that can be easily covered with clothing. The location of your tattoo will dictate\u00a0the type of design that is appropriate.\n\nTa Moko face\n\nTa Moko face\n\n3. Work with a local artist to create the design of your tattoo: you may have to go outside your area, but there are many artists who are specialized in Maori designs. Working with a qualified artist will ensure that you get a proper respectful and meaningful tattoo able to represent you. Ask to see a sample of the artist\u2019s work so you\u2019ll know if your ability is up to par.\n\n4. If the search for an artist in your area is too hard, look for a Maori tattoo artist from all around the world: get someone abroad for the\u00a0design of the tattoo and a local artist to\u00a0run it.\n\n5. Consider the possibility of a Kirituhi tattoo design if you\u2019re worried about the meaning of your tattoo: initially, Kirituhi were\u00a0painted on the body with charcoal. Nowadays, they have experienced a modern revival, being tattooed on the skin. These tattoos are inspired by Ta Moko, but have no real meaning. Thus, you\u2019ll get all the aesthetic benefits of a Maori tattoo without the cultural problems.\n\nTags: , , ,\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

After some debating, they decided that her friend was going to be an artist, and she was going to be a gallery\u2026 What? A gallery? \u00a0What happened to a doggies or clowns!\u00a0\n\nSo, I do what I always do when confronted with a crafting dilemma\u2026 Or any dilemma for that matter\u2026 Google it! Or if that doesn\u2019t work, try Pinterest. (Sometimes in the reverse order) but the only ideas I could find were costumes that were actual paintings, which were really cool, like the one below, but not what she had envisioned.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to be just one piece of art, she wanted to be the whole gallery! So, we started at fabric land and bought some gold leather-like fabric that we thought would work well to make picture frames.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe cut out a bunch of frames in various sizes. Then, we cut some white rectangles to go inside of the frames. We ended up using some white leather scraps, and sharpies. She took the white squares into school and had a few of her friends design the pieces of art. Then we glued the artwork inside the frames. Here is what they looked like laid out on our kitchen floor.\n\nAnd here is what Sam looked like laid out on our kitchen floor. Lol. \u00a0We used the same gold leather to cut out letters spelling \u201cart gallery\u201d and we wanted the make sure they were spaced out evenly so we put a dab of hot glue on each letter to hold them in place.\n\n\nWe also tacked down all of the artwork with a drop of hot glue. We wanted to make sure they were all appropriately placed, which was why we did it when she was wearing it as opposed to just laying it on the floor.\n\nWe did exactly the same thing to the pants. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThen we decided that the back needed something, so we cut out and added some more letters.\n\nShe took off the shirt and pants and we glued around each frame and letter.\n\nThis is what she looked like on her way out to go trick-or-treating. We added a couple frames on her cheeks with face paint.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd here is her and Dylan\u2026\u00a0\n\nI think it turned out well. The hardest part was coming up with the idea! But, she was happy, and that is the most important part. Im upset that I forgot to take a picture of her and her friend together in their costumes! I don\u2019t know if you can tell by the looks on their faces, but they really weren\u2019t that excited about making their friends wait for them to go trick-or-treating until I took a few photos\u2026just wait until I tell them that I want a photo with Santa again this year!\u00a0\n\nI know this post is a little late, but better late than never right? I\u2019m just thinking of it as being really early for next year! \u00a0It has been a crazy couple of months, and I have lots of posts to catch up on!\u00a0\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.
