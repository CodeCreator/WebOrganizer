Indeed, in some instances we determined that minor modifications of layout and other changes would enhance the digital presentation of this work and were incorporated.\n\nFurthermore, we have added some features that we believe make the web edition easier to use than a literal replication of the print edition would provide. But none of these additions or changes detract from the intellectual integrity of the original work.\n\nWe do not represent that we hold any copyright to the original work (see permissions) work -- just this digital edition.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this work and find it valuable.\n\nBACK to the home page for this book\n\nLast updated August 16, 2001",

Also, she will look at referrals by a client or an editor. Joyce Hart will accept both e-mail and USPS proposals.\n\n\u2022 Jim Hart, Terry Burns, Diana Flegal, Linda Glaz and Andy Scheer are looking at selected first-time authors, published authors and referrals. These agents accept ONLY e-mail submissions per requirements below. No zip files. Please do NOT submit any material that would conflict with the Christian worldview.\n\n\u2022 All e-mail submissions sent to Hartline Agents should be sent as a MS Word doc (or in rich text file format from another word processing program ) attached to an e-mail with \"submission: title, authors name and word count\" in the subject line. A proposal is A SINGLE document, not a collection of files. Place the query letter in the email itself. Do not send the entire proposal in the body of the e-mail or send PDF files. There is a nice checklist to ensure your manuscript is properly formatted that you are welcome to use at the submit page.\n\n\u2022 Our core strength is representing inspirational fiction and non-fiction books for adults. We do not market children's books, short fiction, screenplays, scripts, poetry, or magazine articles. We represent most genres in inspirational or commercial fiction except science fiction and fantasy. We are probably not the right agency to market your literary fiction, nor do we represent books that contain extraordinary violence, unnecessary profanity, or gratuitous sexuality.\n\n\u2022 Hartline works with domestic (living in the United States or Canada) authors ONLY at this time. For information on what we like to see in a submitted proposal please select Fiction guidelines or nonfiction guidelines.\n\nCopyright 2002-...
