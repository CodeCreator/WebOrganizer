Firstly to begin with, I was not notified that any report was going to be made for whatever reason, so I do NOT have any footage and don't understand why it was so hard to notify myself. Furthermore, there are multiple reasons as to why the officer was shot and the escalation included: 'Deathmatching is the act of attacking a player without a proper IC motive and interaction.' - He persistently followed us for aroun\n  2. +1 I want to buy one because @JakeInnit_ is renting his so I cant use.\n  3. -1 I agree that cutting somebody's hair publicly and with no reason is quite unrealistic. However, if you are going to sit in a drug lab and expect no repercussions and complain if your hair gets cut, then simply don't go back or learn to avoid situations or locations that may lead to hostility. I have had my haircut once in my 2000 hours playing and it's done as a form of humiliation rather than done to be sexist and racist, as stated above, don't get into situations that may lead to hostility.

Enzo_Volkov (ID 307) - Do you think it\u2019s proper roleplay to not focus on your injuries but instead focus on calling out where someone is? Well I'm unsure if this is directly aimed at me or not due to the only clip provided regarding me being me saying 'HAHAHA'. As for the part of not focusing on my injures, my injures will and always are my number one priority and if I recall I even RP'd clenching onto my wounds in attempt to slow the bleeding and was later on BLS'd by my ally.

I will just go over a few of your invalid points in this situation that you have both mentioned. - As for the claim of us knowing you where up on the roof - that is completely invalid, we chose to go up on the roof to attempt to gain height advantage which was quickly shut down by the fact you where already up there. - As for the claim of us 'hopping out' on your allies - this is also invalid, they began following us and they then decided to pass us so I decided to use that opportunity to grab my gun from inside my bag and the same for Lewis Miller.

Can you give me a rundown of who it's about and what they're trying to accomplish, without going into spoiler territory? Sell it to me.\n  4. How much German have you learned thus far?

I may or may not add more, or flesh it out a lot more. ---- Day 1- I escaped prison only to be caught and stranded on a remote island with a bunch of strangers. I feel sorry for the others, but I\u2019m gonna win this death game. Day2- crafted a shovel first and started planting pitfalls along the river. Everyone's gotta drink sometime\u2026 Day3- Stuck in the dirt, poor Cherry never knew what hit her. I put my shovel down. I took the axe from her unconscious hands and finished the job. 9 more to go. Day4- Apollo almost had me with that first headshot from behind an apple tree. He really does have eagle eyes, doesn\u2019t he? I blocked a few shots with my shovel, dove behind a tree, and dug myself a foxhole. He gave up eventually, unwilling to close the distance, but most of the daylight is already gone. Too late to do much but dig my foxhole deeper and plan out my revenge\u2026 Day5- The wild bamboo near the river has finally grown long enough to suit me. I spent some time upgrading my pitfalls and fortifying my foxhole. Luckily, there\u2019s a mango orchard and a river on two sides to provide protection and sustenance. I was fishing with a bamboo pole when I heard the snap, the yelp, and the shrieking. The glorious shrieking. It was a long lullaby that worked its charm quickly, after my productive day. I decided to give \u2018em till morning to regret the life decisions that put 'em in my way\u2026 ------ To Be Continued..\n  9.

I'm pretty new to this site, though not unfamiliar with Destructoid. I've been here for news posts and been to some of their awesome events (like karaoke at E3!)\n\nMy name is Regina, but I pretty much always go by Wedge. No, that did not come from Star Wars (usually the first guess) or Final Fantasy (usually the second guess). It's actually a derivative of my name - Regina => Reggie => Wedgie => Wedge.\n\nI work for Intel as a Performance Engineer. Basically what I do involves benchmarking, and for me specifically, I benchmark games for Intel. I often get to determine which 3-5 minute portion of a game best represents the performance needs of the game as a whole. Yes, this means I get to spend a good portion of my day playing PC games, though it's not nearly as glamarous as it sounds. ;) I also write for the Intel blog the Inside Scoop ( about gaming in general - my latest post includes my E3 impressions.\n\nWhile my work life focuses a lot on PC games, I play stuff on every system out there. I have a list of my top 10 games in my profile, which I'll repaste here:\n\nMy Top 10 Favorite Games: (subject to change)\n1. Final Fantasy 6\n2. Starcraft\n3. Street Fighter Alpha 3\n4. Parappa the Rapper\n5. Tetris Attack\n6. King's Quest VI\n7. Phoenix Wright: Justice for All\n8. Katamari Damacy\n9. Left 4 Dead\n10. Rock Band 2\n\nI could probably go into several pages of detail as to why each of these made the list, because I'm like that. But I will save those for some other blogs... maybe I'll run down the list one at a time.\n\nActually, the last item on there, Rock Band 2, I can probably explain with this next bit about myself. I run the Guitar Hero\/Rock Band division of the PMS Clan. The mission of the PMS Clan is to provide a fun, competitive and positive environment for female gamers. We all know what it's like to play in the wilds of the internet - people can be incredibly disrespectful (to say the least), and even moreso when a female is around. In fact, the worst part of it is that some folks don't even realize how disrespectful they are because they think they're trying to be nice! With the PMS Clan, girls (and guys too - we have tons of guys in our clan) can play in a harassment free environment, where having a good time and competing in a game can go hand in hand. For my division in the clan specifically, we play Guitar Hero and Rock Band - we're open to all skill levels to join, but we actually house some of the best players around the world in our division. I myself was once at the top of the vocal leaderboards in Rock Band - and as such, the game has become more than just a game to me... it's now a way to bond with the wonderful folks in my division, and at this point in my life the game is just a huge part of what I do every single day.\n\nSo as you can see, I'm a competitive person and I love games - so when Intel asked me to get involved in Friday Night Fights it was a no brainer to me. It gave me the push to actively join this community, and after poking around a bit and learning more of how this place operates I'm really happy to be here!\n\nSpeaking of Friday Night Fights, the best score I've gotten on that Cosmic Cannon game has been a measly 17. :( Something about that game just eludes me... argh! I'm a little bit better at Quake Live, but not much - usually I just try to grab the rocket launcher and spam away. Not QUITE my style of shooter, but I'm getting used to it - is it just me or is the shotgun ridiculously powered in the game? Maybe I should try using that more often...\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Reply via cblogs\n\nGet comment replies by email. \u00a0 \u00a0 settings\n\nUnsavory comments?
