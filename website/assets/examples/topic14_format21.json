        "text":"For Amy Shafer and her family, Watermark provides the perfect mix of wide-open park space and accessibility. Andrea Cox \/ For CREB\u00aeNow\n\nCity-limits bliss\n\nAmy Shafer found her own private oasis in Watermark at Bearspaw\n\nAmy Shafer grew up on a farm, so when it came to building her dream home, being immersed in nature on the doorstep of wide-open park space was a top priority. She and her husband, and their three children, had been living in Valley Ridge, but just didn\u2019t feel connected. Their search for the perfect lot brought them to Watermark in Bearspaw, where they purchased a 1.33-acre home site that backs on to an Aspen grove, a freshwater pond and walking trails. The community features 46 acres of parkland and 16 ponds, and brushes up against the Haskayne Legacy Park, with trails connecting to Calgary and Cochrane.\n\nCREB\u00aeNow: What attracted you to the community of Watermark?\n\nAmy Shafer: We looked inner-city and rural, but we found acreages to be too much work. About the time when we were looking \u2013 around six years ago \u2013 the ads for Watermark came out, so we went to take a look. It was so close to the city and yet the lots were really huge. When we looked at it, the development was still a farmer\u2019s field, so we really got a feel for what the area was like. We chose our lot because it is really this private oasis that backs onto a pond and a forested grove. Plus there are all of these walking trails \u2013 the pathways are phenomenal. I have a dog and walk her twice a day, the kids can skateboard and ride their bikes, and there are so many parks. The central plaza with the water feature and barbecues is an amazing spot to hang out in and meet with the neighbours.\n\nCREB\u00aeNow: Can you talk about the sense of community within Watermark?\n\nAmy Shafer: We were really searching for a community that had a close-knit feeling and Watermark is everything that we were looking for \u2013 I don\u2019t think that we will ever leave. It\u2019s all young families here and probably three-quarters of the kids go to Bearspaw School. The school bus literally stops on our driveway, so I don\u2019t even have to get out of my pajamas in the morning.\n\nI love my neighbours so much. Because we were in phase one, everybody was new at the same time. The developer did all of these gatherings at the beginning so that everyone could get to know each other \u2013 Stampede breakfasts, Easter egg hunts, movie nights in the park, and those events are ongoing.\n\nOn Fridays school is out at 2 p.m. and everyone goes to the park. It is just packed and everyone knows each other. There is always something going on \u2013 someone is having a fire pit or a dinner or friends over to watch the game. We don\u2019t need to leave the community \u2013 we just go to a neighbour\u2019s house. We really weren\u2019t expecting the social part of the community. It\u2019s been amazing.\n\nCREB\u00aeNow: Could you speak to the location and the amenities?\n\nAmy Shafer: We are right on the edge of Tuscany, so we are basically in Calgary, but just have a Rocky View County designation. My husband works downtown. It\u2019s no different of a commute than it was from our previous home in Valley Ridge. He\u2019s never complained and he likes living out here so much that it is well worth it. We also have a CTrain station a few minutes away in Tuscany that takes you right downtown.\n\nThe accessibility from here is fantastic. With Stoney Trail, it is so easy to get anywhere \u2013 to the mountains and to the east side of the city.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

        "text":"A day in the life of Lead Volunteer, Liam\n\nby PDSA | 1 June #Lifestyle\n\nOur volunteers mean the world to us. That's why we're shining a light on dedicated PDSA Lead Volunteer Liam this Volunteers' Week.\n\nLiam is one of our fantastic Lead Volunteers and has been at our Bramley PDSA shop since October 2021. We recently caught up with Liam to see what role volunteering plays in his life and what he enjoys most about volunteering in a PDSA charity shop.\n\nHow did you first get to know about PDSA?\n\nI first came across PDSA when I took my pet cats to the PDSA Pet Hospitals in Leeds and Bradford. Here, I got to witness the fantastic work of PDSA first-hand.\n\nWhy did you want to become a volunteer for PDSA?\n\nAs a proud owner of cats, the cause is certainly close to my heart. From visiting the Pet Hospitals with my own pets, I realised how important the work of the PDSA is and I felt inspired to help - which is why I looked into volunteering some of my time at one of their shops!\n\nHow often do you volunteer at PDSA?\n\nI volunteer 2-3 days a week.\n\nWhat does a typical day for you look like?\n\nEach day can be different. Usually, I will tidy the shop floor, restock the shelves and price any new stock that arrives. Throughout the day, I will also operate the till and serve customers, which I really enjoy doing.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about volunteering?\n\nOne of the parts I enjoy most about volunteering is meeting new people! Lots of different people come into the shop and I like getting to know them and understanding why they choose to support PDSA. Another benefit of volunteering that I like most is the structure it provides. I\u2019m out of employment due to health reasons, so volunteering brings an element of routine to my week.\n\nWhat is the most unusual\/interesting item you\u2019ve come across at a PDSA shop?\n\nThe most interesting item I\u2019ve come across whilst volunteering is a violin. We receive lots of clothes, books, and toys (which we\u2019re always very grateful for!), so a violin is not the type of item we\u2019d think someone would donate.\n\nHas Covid-19 affected your volunteering role?\n\nI started volunteering for PDSA at the beginning of October 2021 (after the Covid-19 lockdown), but a lot of the health and safety precautions are still in place. I still sanitise my hands regularly throughout the day - we have a responsibility to protect the elderly and vulnerable who shop with us.\n\nWould you recommend volunteering at a PDSA charity shop? If yes, why?\n\nAbsolutely! For anyone else out there that may have a mental health issue, like me, volunteering at PDSA creates a sense of belonging and is a great way to fill your time. I\u2019ve developed many skills role and I\u2019ve completed training in all aspects of retail \u2013 from visual merchandising to customer service. As a Lead Volunteer, I supervise and support other volunteers which has also helped to build my confidence.\n\nI\u2019m hoping to work full-time in paid employment again in the future and (if and when this is possible) my role as Lead Volunteer at PDSA will have played a huge part in my recovery.\n\nDo you think PDSA is an important charity?\n\nThe PDSA is very important as it offers vet care to pet owners who may not be able to afford a private vet. Without PDSA, there would be a lot more pets who would suffer because their owners can\u2019t afford the treatment costs. As a pet owner myself, it\u2019s a cause very close to my heart and I think PDSA are simply brilliant.\n\nWhat would you say to someone who was thinking about volunteering at a PDSA charity shop?\n\nI would say to anyone thinking of volunteering for the PDSA to go for it - whether that's somebody out of work and needing something to fill their day, somebody with health problems (like myself) who is hoping to take the next step in their recovery, or students looking to develop new skills for their CV and obtain a reference for future employment. It\u2019s a great place to be, no matter your age, level of experience, or the amount of time you have to spare. Get involved - you won\u2019t regret it!\n\nFind an exciting volunteering opportunity at a PDSA shop near you\n\nShare this article on:\u00a0 PDSA | 1 June\n\n\nPet care tips, news, supporter stories and vet Q&As",

        "text":"In 2011, the oldest of the baby boomers began turning 65. This powerful market segment has seen its parents grow older and face physical challenges, which boomers hope to avoid. Jeanne Anthony, senior project manager of education and outreach at AARP spoke with REMODELING about baby boomers\u2019 desire to stay in their homes and communities as they get older and how remodelers can help facilitate that. She presented \u201cThe Great Migration: Boomers on the Threshold of Retirement\u201d at the 2012 Remodeling Leadership Conference.\n\nRemodeling: Regarding housing and lifestyle, what have baby boomers learned from watching their aging parents?\n\nJeanne Anthony: Boomers see themselves as fit, younger than their chronological years, and understandably have a hard time facing that their own physical abilities will change, especially as they watch it happen to their parents. For the most part, they don\u2019t plan for the future \u2014 their homes suit them now \u2014 and they don\u2019t want to introduce features that suggest \u201caging\u201d or needing assistance. And they definitely don\u2019t want their friends or neighbors to see those features!\n\nBut they do recognize that many homes aren\u2019t adequately designed to let people age gracefully and comfortably, without any stigma. When we talk about \u201cuniversal design,\u201d which is all about creating the kinds of environments people want \u2014 beauty, comfort, and safety \u2014 unfortunately, people don\u2019t know what that term means. They don\u2019t know how to ask for universal design features \u2014 they\u2019ll know it when they see it.\n\nA great example is the no-step entry. If you enter a home without a step, it doesn\u2019t hit you that you have just benefited from a universal design feature. But it\u2019s convenient for everyone \u2014 younger people trying to carry in packages and a baby or pushing a stroller, as well as for people for whom steps are difficult.\n\nRM: The terms \u201cuniversal design\u201d and \u201caging-in-place\u201d are frequently misunderstood. What have you learned about that?\n\nJA: We\u2019ve done consumer surveys to get reactions to the name \u201cuniversal design,\u201d and what we learned is that the term is not well understood or seen as very descriptive. To try to eliminate some of the confusion and to help consumers gain a better understanding of universal design, we think changing the terminology would be helpful. We\u2019re trying to rename it \u201cBetter Living Design.\u201d We think that\u2019s more descriptive of the concept; it\u2019s terminology people understand and will accept \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t want \u201cBetter Living Design\u201d?\n\nWe\u2019re also trying to promote that these features are good for all people; from 5 to 85. A no-step entry makes it easier if you have a leg in a cast; a shower where you don\u2019t have to step over a ledge to enter or even a handheld showerhead that can be adjusted for a child to use \u2026 all benefit a variety of people. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to accomplish.\n\nRebranding Universal Design\n\nRM: How are consumers learning about \u201cBetter Living Design\u201d?\n\nJA: AARP has information and checklists on its website, but it\u2019s key for remodelers to help promote universal design. People are looking for experts who can help them. It will also distinguish remodelers from the competition and help them serve their clients better.\n\nNew-home construction has declined dramatically and will take a while to get back to where it was. Remodeling is where the changes in homes will be taking place. We hear from remodelers that their clients aren\u2019t asking for these features, but we would really like for the remodelers to be more proactive. They can play a huge role in helping us create awareness and acceptance by offering Better Living Design features. It goes back to what I said earlier about some of these features being transparent. If remodelers can proactively include them in their designs, their clients will truly benefit, and those clients will tell future clients about how great their new space feels.\n\nFor example, multiple-height counters that allow for seated work in the kitchen by either the cook or a child doing homework can be installed; position outlets higher from the ground, offer rocker light switches instead of toggle types, or suggest refrigerators with freezers on the bottom to your clients and make them aware of lever-handled faucets. Task lighting is a huge boon and is an easy, inexpensive addition to any kitchen remodel. We think homes with Better Living Design features will be more marketable overall because they\u2019ll just feel better.\n\nRM: What about the complaints of cost and attractiveness?\n\nJA: We want to erase the trade-off, i.e. \u201cI can [design this way], but you won\u2019t get your granite countertops.\u201d There are a wide variety of sources across price points that make features affordable for different budgets. And you are right, often, when people think of universal design, they think of hospitals or other institutions. This is one reason why we think changing the nomenclature will help. You can have something that functions as a grab bar but is stylish in appearance and functions as a towel bar, too. There are many features such as kitchen and bath handles that are both attractive and functional. All the major kitchen and bath companies and appliance manufacturers have products available. We are compiling a database to both serve as a resource showing products that are attractive and to demonstrate that Better Living Design doesn\u2019t have to be institutional in appearance.\n\nRM: Where can remodelers get more information?\n\nJA: AARP has resources for consumers on its website. One tool we provide in select local communities is the Home Fit workshop, which helps inform consumers about different ways they can make modifications in their home as they are planning to remodel.\n\nRM: So it\u2019s really up to remodelers to help educate consumers early on?\n\nJA: One of the biggest problems is that people wait until they are confronted with a crisis to begin thinking about updating their homes. And unfortunately, if they do wait it can be too late. We work with remodelers, interior designers, architects, Realtors, and other organizations to try and spread the word.\n\nRemodelers need to have the conversation about how long [a person] intends to stay in their home and let them know that there are things the remodeler can do to make it easier for them, such as wider doorways and wider passageways, a lower kitchen counter so someone can sit down to chop vegetables. Movable \u2014 not fixed \u2014 cabinets can be installed under the counter. They don\u2019t look different, but if you had to move them in the future then it would be easy to do so. You can meet the needs of people of all ages. Remodelers can do things to help homeowners have attractive and convenient features while helping folks maintain their independence.\n\nClick here\u00a0to read more\u00a0from the 2012 Remodeling Leadership Conference speakers.",

        "text":"Uses This\n\nA collection of nerdy interviews asking people from all walks of life what they use to get the job done.\n\nA picture of Paige Icardi\n\nPaige Icardi\n\nHome cook, future yoga teacher\n\nPosted in chef, mac\n\nWho are you, and what do you do?\n\nHi! My name is Paige Icardi. What I do currently is drastically different than what I've been doing for the past 5 years.\n\nPreviously I was extremely immersed in the food industry via Bi-Rite Market in San Francisco. It's a wonderful specialty grocery store that prides itself in curating the most high-quality, thoughtful and amazing tasting food, whether it's the produce, meat or unique pantry goods.\n\nMy start there was originally as a cashier and turned into one of those situations where I moved on up for the next two years, eventually to a store manager and then maintained that position for three more years. I've always loved food and cooking - something that I still was heavily involved in even as a store manager - but still never saw myself in a management role.\n\nIt took me two years of stress and one year of being extremely ill to finally have the sense to quit.\n\nThat leads to me what I currently do. While I continue my recovery, I've been practicing a lot of yoga, which has done a great deal for helping me with pain management. It has been such an integral part of my life now, so much so that I also wanted to quit so I could study yoga more and eventually teach it too.\n\nSince I'm technically unemployed, I've also been keeping myself busy and making some money cooking for a family that shops at the market. For her and her family I cook a handful of meals and recipes that fit their diets with only ingredients from Bi-Rite, which makes me happy that I still have some sort of tie to the store. It's been a really wonderful way to keep busy doing something I'm very passionate about, and to make a little extra money on the side.\n\nWhat hardware do you use?\n\nCurrently my hardware consists of my yoga mat, some props and cozy clothes. I absolutely love the yoga brand, Alo Yoga, which is where my mat is from, along with lots of my comfy leggings. I live on their mat, and am currently typing this atop it.\n\nI also get a lot of help from my MacBook Air and iPhone 8. Despite my age and generation, I'm not the most technologically savvy and like to keep it simple.\n\nAnd what software?\n\nI actually use a fantastic app\/website to take yoga classes when I'm not practicing alone called Alo Moves, formally known as CodyApp. It's way more affordable than going to yoga classes in San Francisco, and I absolutely love the variety of amazing teachers and types of yoga it has to offer.\n\nWhat would be your dream setup?\n\nMy dream set up consists of having my own space for me to practice. All I want in a space is peace and quiet, plenty of room\/wall space - and hardwood floors! Right now I'm currently in a living room in a 1 bedroom apartment and, while my husband and I are luckier than most to have a roomier apartment, it's still cramped and we would benefit from a little more space. We have been discussing for quite some time now the idea of buying a house, potentially in the Pacific Northwest, so the dream setup will hopefully become a reality sooner than later.",

        "text":"An Interview with Bing McCoy\n\nEver since starting Rom, Spaceknight Revisited, I've wondered who created the Rom action figure and how I could find out. I would like to say that after weeks of research, I was finally able to track him down, but that's not what happened. From out of the blue in April 2004, I got an e-mail from a man known as Lawrence \"Bing\" McCoy saying, \"greetings from the guy who created ROM. I've got some bits and pieces around - what do you need?\" My immediate answer was, \"an interview!\" Thank goodness he agreed. Due to his busy schedule, it's taken some time, but here, finally, is a brief interview with the man who created Rom.\n\n\nRom, Spaceknight Revisited: There's very little info about you on the Web. What was your background before creating the Rom action figure?\n\nBing McCoy: [I'm] not surprised as I've generally kept a low profile and away from the media. Here's the URL to all my info at my company website:\n\n[Interviewer's note: The page did not exist at the time I first asked the question. McCoy's credits include Electronic Battleship; the Starbird (check out Bug Eyed Monster's page on it); the direct to video children's show Adventures of Gregory and Bushkin, which he wrote, produced, and directed; and the Photon Guitar Synthesizer.]\n\nPrior to making toys I was a touring musician. [I] played with people like EmmyLou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, etc. (Odd, because I am not a country musician.) Music has become a great hobby and now and then I put out a CD for friends. [Here's a] link to streaming mp3s of recent music, if of interest.\n\nRSR: What term do you use to describe your job title\/career? Both now and in the late '70s, if they're different.\n\nMcCoy: Never had a title or thought about it. Used to be an inventor. Now I'm told I'm an executive producer. Sounds fancy, but doesn't really mean anything to me.\n\nAction Figure\n\nRSR: What was the toy market like around 1979, when Rom was released? Electronic toys were still very new, right?\n\nMcCoy: Electronic toys were very new and as a result we sold them as fast as we could make them. I probably sold 20 - 30 toys in the space of five years.\n\nRSR: Tell me about the genesis of Rom.\n\nMcCoy: ROM started out as an Egyptian mystic toy. Of course I was young and dumb and didn't consider that no toy company would want to sell an Egyptian mystic, so I made it into a cyborg (part man \/ part machine) after all the toy companies passed on the \"Egyptian\" concept. Parker Bros. picked it up because they thought it would be good to try something outside the board game business.\n\nRSR: Did you name him or did Parker Brothers? Was he named for Read Only Memory?\n\nMcCoy: I originally named him \"COBOL\" after the programming language. Parker Bros. changed the name to ROM. I figure that was because of read only memory - plus it sounded like a name.\n\nRSR: Rom's box is marked \"patent pending.\" I have been unable to find any patents related to him in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's database. What was the patent for? Was it merely a design patent or was it related to his electronics?\n\nMcCoy: The patent was issued May 12, 1981. Patent #4,267,551.\n\n[Interviewer's note: This is an off-site link to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database. The patent is for a \"multi-mode doll,\" described as, \"an electronic toy doll including electronic circuitry for selectively generating a number of simulation sounds typically associated with a mystic or science fantasy character.\"]\n\nIn addition to your name, I see Scott Dankman and Richard C. Levy on the patent. What were their roles?\n\nMcCoy: Scott Dankman and I originally started a company after my success with Electronic Battleship. Scott handled the biz stuff and I did the inventing. Later on we brought Richard Levy as the 'marketing guy'. I agreed to let them sign on as co-inventors so that they could [claim] capital gains status on their tax returns. Both Scott and I dissolved the partnership after a few years.\n\nRSR: Did Parker Brothers make any tweaks to your design?\n\nMcCoy: Well, of course they improved\/designed the appearance, but the electronics and basic concept stayed the same.\n\nRSR: Why does Rom have so few points of articulation?\n\nMcCoy: Cost. At that time, making an action figure that large was considered a gamble, so Parker Bros. cut cost anywhere they could. The original ROM had green LED eyes and those were changed to red becuase green LEDs were a lot more expensive back then.\n\n[Interviewer's note: Upon later consideration, this probably isn't a fair question. The Rom action figure had about the same number of points of articulation as Barbie did back then.]\n\nRSR: What sort of toys were Rom's main competition? Big Trak? The Starbird (which you also designed)?\n\nMcCoy: I actually don't know what toys were competition. I know later on other companies decided to put electronics in action figures.\n\nRSR: Did you plan or design any other toys to go with Rom?\n\nMcCoy: I didn't plan any more toys for ROM. It was a one-off.\n\nRSR: Did you create any sort of backstory for him?\n\nMcCoy: My only back story was that he was a cyborg. Marvel came up with the main story concept.\n\nRSR: Do you know why Parker Brothers never created any Dire Wraith toys? If not, do you have any theories?\n\nMcCoy: ROM pretty much flopped as a toy, so Parker Bros. didn't want to make any more stuff. My (personal) theory is that Parker Bros. didn't market it very well. Which is understandable because they were a board game company, not an action figure company.\n\nRSR: What do you feel could have been done to make the Rom action figure more successful?\n\nMcCoy: Better marketing. And the box was a terrible graphic design. It just didn't look very sexy.\n\nRSR: Rom was sold by Parker Brothers in the U.S. and Palitoy in the U.K. What other countries was it available in?\n\nMcCoy: I don't know. If Palitoy sold it, then it was probably available in a number of European countries - but that's just a guess.\n\nRSR: Do you know roughly how many Rom figures were manufactured or sold in the U.S.? The U.K.? Elsewhere (if applicable)?\n\nMcCoy: I think about 200k-300k units were sold.\n\nComic Book\n\nRSR: Early interviews with the comic book's creators indicated Parker Brothers came to Marvel with the name \"Dire Wraiths,\" but had no idea what a Dire Wraith might be. Was that a name you created?\n\nMcCoy: No. I did not create the name. Parker Bros. pretty much took it and ran with it. Then Marvel took over the story line.\n\nRSR: Did you read the Rom comic book?\n\nMcCoy: Definitely.\n\nRSR: Were you surprised that the comic outlived the toy by so many years?\n\nMcCoy: No - the comic was good and the final toy product didn't really fulfill the story in the comic.\n\nRSR: Does it bother you that Rom was more successful as a comic book character than a toy?\n\nMcCoy: No. I thought the comic was better than the toy and was happy just to be part of it. The only thing that ever upset me was when Paul Verhoeven blatently ripped it off as \"RoboCop\". Pretty much same design, and very similar storyline. Unfortunately \"intellectual property\" lawsuits of this nature rarely succeed, so we just let it go.\n\nRSR: Marvel, however, went on to secure the rights to produce a RoboCop comic. Also, well known comic book creator Frank Miller wound up writing RoboCop 2 and 3. And when the Rom comic book series debuted, Miller provided the cover for #1. There's a certain irony there, don't you think?\n\nMcCoy: Yes, I knew about all that. When Marvel became so successful that Stan Lee was no longer in control, things changed - and I don't mean for the better. After Frank Miller wrote the second RoboCop he realized he didn't want to do that anymore, but he was stuck. His quote about writing features - \"you're a fire hydrant and there's a line of dogs around the block.\"\n\nRSR: Did you ever meet any of the creators behind the comic?\n\nMcCoy: I know Stan Lee pretty well. We used to go to lunch regularly, though I haven't talked to him in a long time. Other than that I didn't meet any of the people behind the comic.\n\nRSR: Any parting comments you'd like to make to Rom's fans?\n\nMcCoy: Long live ROM, those who have followed his chronicles, and the pursuit of galactic peace.

In April, we hired Cara Pagels to assist with our Property Management department. She recently sat down and shared a bit about herself with us, including what she does for the company and why she chose to work for Holladay Properties. Learn more about Cara straight from the source below.\n\nQ: We are so happy to welcome you to our team! Please tell us a bit about your positions.\n\nCARA: I am thrilled to join the Holladay Properties team as Property Manager at Burlington Station in Downtown Downers Grove - my hometown! Once Burlington Station\u2019s construction is complete, I will lead day-to-day operations, leasing, and manage maintenance for our 89-unit community. I love Burlington Station\u2019s convenient location, architecture tailor made for Downers Grove, and the variety of lifestyles offered to residents.\n\nQ: Where do you come to Holladay from?\n\nCARA: Prior to joining Holladay Properties, I worked with a top producing multi-generational family residential real estate team, lived in South Korea teaching elementary school, and founded my own non-profit called Marrow Me Cara. Marrow Me Cara recruits lifesaving marrow donors to the National Bone Marrow Registry. Through our efforts, thousands of marrow donors joined the registry and 16 donors (and counting!) have been matched to patients in need of a lifesaving transplant.\n\nQ: How long have you been doing what you do?\n\nCARA: Fresh to Property Management, I come from 4 generations of real estate professionals which include my great-great-aunt, grandmother, mother, aunt, and sister. Real estate is in my blood!\u00a0 I am thrilled to make an impact in managing my favorite property in Downers Grove and to create a community that is home to many.\n\nQ: What do you love most about your work?\n\nCARA: The people and the stories! Meeting people from all walks of life is truly my favorite part of property management. Not many others have the honor of helping people create their desired lifestyle by helping find their nest. Also, the opportunity to witness all phases of the construction process of Burlington Station has been fascinating. I can\u2019t wait for residents to move in after the years of planning and building!\n\nQ: Do you have any hobbies or passions outside of the office?\n\nCARA: Volunteering, foreign language, wellness, and learning to cook international foods. Anything cooked with kimchi (spicy Korean cabbage) is a winner in my book. If you haven\u2019t tried kimchi before and can handle a little spice, let\u2019s talk!\n\nQ: What made you choose Holladay?\n\nCARA: I choose Holladay for its strong leadership and commitment to bettering local communities. We have a really great group of people here that strongly values community development from involvement with Boys and Girls Club, to building Hannah\u2019s Hope inclusive playground in Portage, Indiana.\n\nQ: Anything else you\u2019d like to share?\n\nCARA: I\u2019m a Hoosier too and was born in Indianapolis.

        "text":"If your home isn't selling, what should you do? Real estate agent Yawar Charlie, star of a new reality show, \"Listing Impossible,\" can offer some hope and helpful advice.\n\nCNBC's \"Listing Impossible\"\u2014which premiered Jan. 15 and airs on Wednesdays at 10 p.m. EST\u2014follows Charlie at the Los Angeles brokerage Aaron Kirman Partners as he and his colleagues devise fresh ways to revive stale listings and entice buyers to bite. There's even a surprise appearance from David Hasselhoff!\n\n\u201cIt really gives you the nuts and bolts on what it takes to sell challenging homes, and what it takes to sell a home in general,\u201d Charlie told realtor.com in an exclusive interview. \"It\u2019s not candy-coated, so the viewer really gets to see the process and the journey\u2014not only of the home, but of the sellers.\u201d\n\nCurious why certain homes won't sell and what can be done to make them move, we talked with Charlie to hear his advice\u2014for home sellers and buyers\u2014plus the surprising story behind how he bought his first home.\n\nListing Impossible\nYawar Charlie of \"Listing Impossible\"\n\n\nHow did you end up buying your first home?\n\nI used to be an actor in L.A., and I had worked pretty steadily. But when you\u2019re my type, and this is back 15 years ago, there weren\u2019t a lot of opportunities. I kept getting the note \"too pretty for a terrorist.\"\n\nI can laugh at it now, but at the time it was very annoying. Still, I was on a soap opera for a while and I took that money I earned and I saved it. I was thinking I should do something smart with it, and decided that I really wanted to buy a house.\n\nI didn\u2019t know where to start, so I sought out a casual acquaintance who was a real estate agent. However, this person was a horrible agent and didn\u2019t take good care of me. It all ended up working out, though, because I ended up doing a lot of the research on my own, so I learned from that. In fact, I learned I had a real affinity for real estate.\n\nHow did you transition from home buyer to a real estate agent?\n\nI casually set up a couple of real estate deals for friends and family. And my partner at the time said, \"You know, Yawar, you\u2019re really good at this, why don\u2019t you consider this as sort of a supplemental career until acting really kicks in full gear?\"\n\nThat was about 13 years ago, and within the first nine months of getting my real estate license and joining a team, I was the top new agent in my office. It was a real blessing because when you\u2019re a creative person, you have to find an outlet for that creativity.\n\nFor me, when I work with someone selling a home, I find the creative side of things. I say, \"Let's tell a story of this house, let's figure out a way to connect someone to it emotionally when they walk in the room.\"\n\nYawar Charlie\nListing Impossible -- Wexler House -- Pictured: (l-r) -- (Photo by: Nicole Weingart\/CNBC)\n\n\nYour new show is all about moving homes that seem impossible to sell. Why do you think certain homes sit on the market?\n\nWhen something is sitting on the market, 9 times out of 10, it comes down to the price.\n\nAs simple as it sounds, if you price a property too high, it will sit unless it finds that one person who falls in love with it and has to have it. But that kind of Cinderella ending only happens in fairy tales. People want to make sure that they\u2019re not overpaying on a house.\n\nHome sellers should have an honest conversation with their real estate agent about what their house is worth. An agent who takes a house that's overpriced does that seller a disservice,\u00a0because an overpriced house is going to sit.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of agents who will underprice a property to get a quick sale or multiple offers. And I really think that sometimes that\u2019s the way to go. However, it requires the seller to have a leap of faith that you\u2019ll be able to get multiple offers, that someone won\u2019t lowball you.\n\nWhat should home sellers do if their listing isn't drumming up enough interest?\n\nOur show is a good representation of what happens when properties have been sitting too long on the market. We come in, retool, rebrand, and relaunch each property. That includes staging, some light construction, decluttering, price adjustment, and the right marketing. These are all things that sellers need to think about.\n\nWe put together a list of items that I encourage the seller to repair or address before we go on the market.\n\nI bring our stager in and have the quote for that. In today\u2019s market, homes must be staged. If a house isn\u2019t staged, it will be devalued. Because a lot of times, buyers don\u2019t have imaginations. They\u2019re like, \"Oh wow, will my TV fit there? Will a couch look good here?\"\n\nWe have to lay it out for them. Of course, there will be those visionaries that will walk through the door, but more often than not, people need to see it.\n\nYawar Charlie\nListing Impossible -- Wexler House -- Pictured: (l-r) -- (Photo by: Nicole Weingart\/CNBC)\n\n\nIn addition to selling hard-to-sell homes, you work with a lot of first-time home buyers. What\u2019s your best advice for them?\n\nSome first-time home buyers think that they\u2019re going to walk into something in their price range and, automatically, it\u2019s going to have everything they want. But that\u2019s usually not the case.\n\nBuying that first home is important because, if you're renting, you are essentially setting money on fire. Even if it\u2019s a smaller place, it\u2019s important to get into something you own because there\u2019s a tax deduction that people can take advantage of, and owning a home is like a forced savings account. That payment that you\u2019re making every month to pay off the principal is paying into equity, so therefore when you go to sell that house, that equity will be there for you.\n\nI like working with my first-time home buyer clients and setting expectations, which are: This won\u2019t be your dream home, it\u2019s not meant to be your dream home. It\u2019s meant to be something that you like, that you are proud to live in, but that most importantly will build you wealth.\n\nWhen they buy that first condo, they\u2019ll be able to trade that in, in three to five years, for a larger condo or a single-family home. And then they\u2019ll be able to flip that single-family home into a larger home that does really fit their dream. But it takes the second or third home to reach that dream home status for most people.\n\nWhat advice would you offer both buyers and sellers on finding the right real estate agent?\n\nMake sure you\u2019re working with a real estate agent who is not a \"yes\" person, who will tell you the hard truth. Because at the end of the day, it does everyone a disservice if you\u2019re working with someone who just tells you what you want to hear. There\u2019s a reason we\u2019re the professionals. We\u2019re boots on the ground, we see the market trends, we\u2019re showing homes every day. Work with someone you know and trust who's going to do right by you.\n\nThe post Home Won't Sell?
