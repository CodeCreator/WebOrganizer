        "text":"Building Water Supply Resilience\n\nStanford University researchers discuss how a diversified water portfolio can meet California\u2019s needs heading into an uncertain future.\n\nBuilding Water Supply Resilience\n\nIncentives to diversify and strengthen water portfolios provide an opportunity to reinvent and fortify water systems for the next century.\n\nAs with the stock market, climate change requires a diversified portfolio of \u00a0solutions.\u00a0\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed an executive order to develop a comprehensive strategy for making the state\u2019s water system climate-resilient. The order calls for a broad portfolio of collaborative strategies to deal with outdated water infrastructure, unsafe drinking water, flood risks and depleted groundwater aquifers.\u00a0\n\nIn a related study published earlier this year, Stanford researchers Newsha Ajami and Patricia (Gonzales) Whitby examined effective strategies to mitigate rising water-scarcity concerns. Ajami is director of Urban Water Policy at Stanford\u2019s Water in the West program and a hydrologist specializing in sustainable water resource management. Whitby is a recent Ph.D. graduate from Stanford\u2019s civil and environmental engineering department and currently a water engineer at environmental consulting firm Brown and Caldwell.\n\nAjami and Whitby took the time to discuss their research and how a diversified water portfolio can meet future water needs.\n\nHow does a diversified water portfolio reduce risks associated with water supply?\n\nAjami: Developing a water supply portfolio means moving away from dependence on one water source such as imported water or groundwater in order to develop a number of other water sources by incorporating local and regional solutions including conservation and efficiency, water recycling and reuse, rainwater and stormwater harvesting, and desalination.\n\nThe golden rule in an investment portfolio is to have diversification, which prevents short-term and long-term risks. The same rule applies to a diversified water portfolio. In order to minimize the risk of short-term and long-term challenges and disruptions due to failing infrastructure or climate change impacts including intensified droughts and floods, it is important to rely on more than one supply source and develop a water portfolio that is comprised of multiple water options in order to increase systematic flexibility and resiliency.\n\nIn developing such a portfolio, utilities and regions should not only focus on the number of sources, but also need to think about the capacity of each supply. Our team has developed a water reliance index that can help measure these goals at both the utility and regional level.\u00a0\n\nWhitby: A water supply portfolio is the combination of water supply sources available to a utility. Diversifying means we\u2019re not putting all of our eggs in one basket, so if something happens to one of the supplies, like a disruption to the physical infrastructure or a water-quality concern or a cutback due to drought, we still have a portfolio of other options available. Water supply diversification should pursue different types of water sources such that each supply has different risks and also different strengths. For example, water reuse is typically considered a robust supply that is resilient to drought. Similarly, diversification means not only having many different water sources available, but also leveraging those sources to reduce stress on the more traditional supplies.\n\nWhat key priorities would you expect California\u2019s water resilience portfolio to focus on?\u00a0\n\nAjami: A water resilience portfolio can look different from region to region, as California faces different challenges, opportunities, risks and limitations across the state. It is important for regions to identify the value and risks of existing and potential water supply options and focus on projects that not only enhance access to clean water, but also deliver broader environmental and societal benefits such as green infrastructure.\n\nIn highly urbanized regions, solutions such as on-site reuse work well, while communities with lower densities may find a centralized recycling plant as a better solution. The state needs to recognize these parameters and provide regions with broad guidelines while enabling and encouraging development of collaborative regional strategies. A model similar to the renewable energy portfolio comes to mind, where regional and a statewide water diversification portfolio goals are set and then incentivized. In a recent study, our team developed a cap-and-goal-based trading model that enables a region to reach their water diversification portfolio goals by working together and taking advantage of regional opportunities to develop a diverse set of water solutions. Such innovative system-level solutions can help water utilities coordinate their efforts, overcome fragmentation and share both financial and water resources while also gradually adjusting their business model.\u00a0\n\nWhat role does climate change play in future planning?\u00a0\n\nAjami: Climate change is magnifying many of our current water challenges. Intensified droughts and floods are demonstrating the limitations of our traditional infrastructure model such as dams and wastewater treatment plants. The shift in our hydrological cycle means that the conventional ways we managed our complex water systems aren\u2019t working.\n\nThe new normal looks very different, as precipitation patterns have shifted and we are receiving more rain than snow. Also due to higher temperatures, snow melts earlier and faster than before, depriving us from our natural reservoir that used to hold much of our summer supply. Sea level rise is threatening our coastal groundwater basins and wastewater treatment plants. Increased wildfires especially in urban-wildland interface is affecting water quality.\n\nOverall climate change is interrupting our water systems. This means climate change has to be front and center in every infrastructure planning process. Our 21st century infrastructure model should look very different from our 20th century model, incorporating more nature-based solutions that can increase our system\u2019s resiliency and flexibility.\u00a0\n\nCan the executive order also help fix California\u2019s outdated drinking water infrastructure?\u00a0\n\nAjami: Absolutely! Replacing and fixing our aging infrastructure requires a holistic approach, and it should also include changing and revamping our funding and financial model. If you look at your energy or telephone bill, there is a line item that provides funding to ensure access to telecommunication and energy infrastructure for rural and low-income communities. This model provides long-term sustainable and stable funding that is essential. This is exactly what we need in the water sector and what we do not have.\n\nGov. Newsom has certainly identified access to clean water as one of his administration\u2019s major issues. His team has certainly tried to find resources to make it happen \u2014 which is a great first step \u2014 but I believe a model similar to energy and telecommunications sectors is needed to guarantee long-term sustainable and resilient solutions for every community in California. \u00a0\n\nWhitby: Definitely. Aging infrastructure is one of the risk factors affecting our water systems today. A fair amount of water is lost to system leaks before it even reaches customers. Incentives to diversify and strengthen our water portfolios provide an opportunity to not only retrofit and expand infrastructure, but also to reinvent and fortify our water system for the next century.\u00a0\n\nBased on your research what factors are necessary for successful implementation of a statewide portfolio?\u00a0\n\nWhitby: Collaboration and innovation. Collaboration because our water systems are inherently very fragmented with jurisdictions that don\u2019t always overlap with municipalities, counties or other agencies such as regulators and land-use planners. Working together can open doors to identify opportunities that are both locally minded and regionally relevant. Innovation needs to happen not only on the technology side, but also in the form of creative governance and financing mechanisms to make the necessary changes possible.\n\nAjami: Encouraging regional collaboration, system-level thinking and innovation especially in water governance and business models are essential elements of any statewide water strategy. In response to some of our statewide water challenges, communities around California have started embracing alternative water solutions and diversifying their water portfolio by introducing demand side management strategies such as water reuse, stormwater and rainwater harvesting, and desalinization, among others.\n\nThese new water sources are slowly disrupting the top-down model of the water sector and introducing more flexibility and resilience to local water systems, especially during droughts and other natural disasters. But these efforts are not often coordinated, and their implementation suffers from our outdated and fragmented governance models, which need to be disrupted and changed.\u00a0\n\n\nComments on this site are submitted by users and are not endorsed by nor do they reflect the views or opinions of COLE Publishing, Inc.

        "text":"Wednesday, May 6, 2015\n\nInterview: Ezra Pryor, chair, Cannabis Chemistry Committee\n\nI contacted Ezra Pryor and conducted a brief e-mail interview. It has been formatted for clarity, but is otherwise unedited:\nCJ: What led you to get interested in starting a ACS committee?\u00a0\nThe committee was formed for the purpose of creating a cannabis chemistry Division of the ACS. \u00a0it gives us access to resources, demonstrates progress and makes official the work we had already been doing. \u00a0another advantage is that we get a chance to learn more about the three technical divisions that are interested in hosting us as a sub-division before moving forward.\u00a0\nDivisions are almost exclusively formed in this way, giving the group a chance to grow under the wing of an existing technical division and then striking it out on our own when the time is right.\u00a0\nCJ:\u00a0How difficult has it been to do so? Have you faced opposition from within ACS?\u00a0\nIt would have been practically impossible except for the fact that this project has been a magnet for some amazing people. \u00a0We have all become great friends and worked hard together to move this forward.\u00a0\nEveryone knows Ezra Pryor, the Chair and founding member and there have been some unsung heroes championing the cause as well.\u00a0\nJoseph Payack was the first to join the effort and has taken on the role of Secretary, Melissa Wilcox was next and has since become our Treasurer, lastly Dr. Jahan Marcu who has risen to the position of Vice-Chair.\u00a0\nWe did not receive serious opposition from anyone at the ACS. \u00a0Those who can see the landscape understand that this is not a flash in the pan but a trend that will carry on into the future. \u00a0We did have some people snicker as they walked past the booth, but far fewer than those that enthusiastically signed out petition of volunteered to help.\u00a0\nMost characteristic of our experience at the national meeting in Denver, in fact, would be the show of enthusiastic support and heartfelt glee for the opportunities that lay ahead.\u00a0\nCJ: Which cannabis businesses have you found to be most in need of guidance from chemists?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe entirety of the cannabis industry seems to be in need of qualified chemists. \u00a0There are of course the dozens of analytical labs dotted across the country that need technicians and there are also countless extraction laboratories that need full-time staff or just a little help overcoming challenges. \u00a0This will come with time as people learn that there are zero legal risk job opportunities for chemists that pay well and present a delightfully low key work environment. \u00a0It was easy to see the transition in progress when you see the enthusiasm of college students who see these jobs that didn't exist quite recently.\u00a0\nWhat was most surprising to me was the great interest showed by several large companies to access and serve the cannabis industry. \u00a0Many companies that offer very useful tools for cannabis purification and analysis are hungry to show how their equipment can be useful and are unsure how to go about exploring this taboo application. \u00a0The CCC has already been facilitating these kinds of method development projects.\nThanks to Ezra Pryor for the interview! It will be interesting to see how things develop. Interesting to note that Joseph Payack has quite a few publications during his tenure as a process chemist in industry.\n\nThe Cannabis Chemistry committee of the American Chemical Society does not yet have a website, but it does have a Twitter account and a Facebook page. A LinkedIn page is in the works.\u00a0\n\n\n  1. CJ: What led you to get interested in starting a ACS committee?\n    (avoids question entirely)\n    Real answer: \"My deep and abiding love of marijuana.\"\n\n    1. Awww, b-dubs, you never struck me as a social conservative.\n\n    2. Eh, i like to think i'm a middle-of-the-road type. But i mean come on, you know it's pretty unlikely that Pryor was some straight-laced kid reading the WSJ when suddenly a lightbulb went off. \"Market opportunity! That's what that is! Wait 'til the ACS hears about this!\"\n\n      Long years in school\/grad school surrounded by people who favored that particular recreational activity did not endear it to me, is all i'm saying. :)\n\n    3. Yeah, I honestly have not know very many users personally (that I've been aware of, anyway.) I'm mostly an oblivious type.\n\n      I have noted that there is a fair bit of interest in \"getting in the ground floor on an obviously expanding business sector\", which you figure that this is. Seeing as how I ascribe to a Kleiman-esque view of the vice business, I'm pretty skeptical from a personal perspective, but very interested in covering it from a news perspective.\n\n  2. Bad Wolf. For your information I am both straight laced and enamored with the cannabis plant. It allows me to function normally despite a neurological disorder.\n\n    1. Interesting characterization! i will have to stop teasing, although i do find your story amusing.\n\n      Anyway thanks for stopping by, good luck with your endeavors. As CJ notes it does appear you can bring a lot of science to bear in an undeveloped area.\n\n  3. This committee is an exciting Joint venture with the ACS that will Blaze new trails in Green chemistry. I'm interested to see what they'll Hash out at their planned networking events.",

Indians have a rate of 620,000 premature deaths per year. The air pollution is so bad in India that it takes around 3.2 years of life away from the average citizen. India can make changes to better their pollution situation, but it has to start with better governmental regulation and harsher air pollution laws.\n\nI think India could take measures to have cleaner air. I think India will need more stations to track pollution and if corporations go over the set number for the pollution, they should get a heavy fine. This will start with India\u2019s government though. They will need to research and budget the pollution they can put out, to have a healthy living setting. India\u2019s government is aiming their future and if they don\u2019t follow through correctly, I think many of peoples lives in India will have a major impact. It will start with their heart and their lungs getting effected then they will slowly die. India\u2019s fate is lying in their own hands, hopefully the government will take action and monitor the health of their people.\n\nDo you think governments should be responsible for monitoring pollution levels? \u00a0I think if all governments did this then the world would be a healthier place but too often the governments look for ways around regulation or ways to blame somebody else for the problem.",

[applause] - nicely done. thank you, dr. cohen. as you can tell,it's been an amazing life. and people say, \"how in the world didyou go from this to that to this to that?\"\n\nand, you know, for me, it's interesting to ponder that, when you get to be my age, and you begin to thinkabout, \"well, what happened thatmade me do those things?\" i can rememberbeing a small girl in the backyardof a small town in tennessee, and my father said, \"see?\" and there was sputnik.\n\nso even at 11 years old, i knew thatthat was the beginning of something awesomefor my generation. it was the beginningof the space age. and of course,there didn't seem to be any place for me in that. they weren't even flyinghumans yet. and even when they began to flyhumans, it was only men. it was only pilots--only test pilots.\n\nbut i was interested in science, and was fascinatedby the human body. and so,when i finished high school, i thought, \"well,what is the best university in the united statesin the life sciences?\" and it was this strange placecalled berkeley. now, i have never--i had never been to california. but i appliedand was accepted in 1965. and for those of youwho are old enough to remember,\n\nthat was an interesting year. that was the free speechmovement. and that morphedinto the anti-war movement and the people's park movementand free love and drugs. and there i wasin the middle of it. i sort of felt like-- later on, when i watchedthe movie \"forrest gump\"-- just kind of like, \"here i am,\"and \"why am i here?\" but i certainly gota good education at berkeley,\n\nboth in physiology and in life in general. but i was one of the few people at the timethat was majoring in science. women just didn't do that,particularly women that i knew. luckily, i had some good mentorsalong the way. but as i was finishingberkeley, you know, i thought, \"i'd really liketo go to medical school.\" but you can imagine,\n\ncoming from tennessee, my first coupleof years at berkeley, i struggled to keep up with all of the restof the people who were pre-med. about a third of the classstarted as pre-med students, so there was a lotof competition. my grades weren't great. i joined the pre-med club, and the advisorkept saying, \"you know,\n\nif you don't bringyour grades up, you'll never be ableto get into school.\" and of course, gettinginto the california schools was close to impossibleunless you had a 3.98. when i appliedto medical school, i had a 3.25. my last two quarterswere straight as, and apparentlythat counted for something. and it certainly countedfor something at\n\nthe university of tennessee, where not too many students were applying from berkeley,as you can imagine, but berkeley hadsuch a great reputation. but they were not takingvery many women in medical school back then. it's hard for young women todayto realize that women were just not being takeninto those fields. but the university of tennessee,the year i applied,\n\ndecided that they were gonnatake a lot of women because there was a big pushto train more women doctors. so in a class of 100,they took six women. that was a lot. but, you know,it took hard work, it took dedication, and it took fitting inwith a group of men and learning to work with men and with male professors.\n\nthere were very few femaleprofessors. there were a lot of nursesthat helped along the way-- nurses who hoped that womenwould succeed in medicine. so i was fortunate to-- that that was partof my background, learning to workwith all kinds of people. my skills, my talents, my interestsfell into the world of surgery. and if it was strangeto have a woman doctor,\n\nit was even strangerto have a woman surgeon. but i applied to the universityprogram and was accepted, and was the only woman they'd ever hadin the surgery program. but again, lots of hard work, lots of peoplewho wanted me to succeed. and i was successful in that. and so i was gonna gobe a rich surgeon, you know? that was my future, you know?\n\ni loved it, and so that'swhat i was gonna do. one of the professors that i worked with said, \"you should come outto my flying school. i have a flight school out here. you'd love to learn how to fly.\" and i thought, \"i'm gonnabe like him and have a airplane when i'm a rich doctor.\" so i asked my fatherfor flying lessons,\n\nand he gave me flying lessons, and i gotmy private pilot's license. and then, all of a sudden,rather serendipitously-- if you read my book, you'll seehow strange this was-- i found out that there was going to be a selectionfor space shuttle astronauts. well, people kind ofdidn't even know in 1977 what the space shuttlewas going to be. but i wrote for an application,\n\njust to see whether or noti met all the criteria to apply, and i did. you had to be at leastfive feet tall, and i made that by two inches. and you had to bein good health. they perf--you had to havea bachelor's degree, preferably an advanced degree, and preferably experiencein your field. and they took my residency--\n\nmy four yearsof residency--as experience. i thought it was more school, but they thoughtit was experience. so i applied to the spaceprogram. lo and behold,in the summer of 1977, i was called to houstonfor an interview. and, um-- they were goingto interview 220 people, and in groups of 20.\n\nand i asked, when they called, \"well, howmany actual people applied?\" if you countedall the military applications, there were 10,000 people. so i felt like, \"man,\" you know, \"if nothing more happens, i made the cut down to 220.\" went down to houston for a week,\n\nand it was the first groupof mission specialists, or non-pilots,that were being interviewed. and so monday morningwas when my-- we went on sunday. we were gonna have a week ofinterviews and physical exams. my interview was scheduledfor 10:30 on monday morning. in looking back at the records,i was the first woman that they ever interviewedfor the astronaut program. the first two groupshad been all male pilots.\n\nso that was an honor in itself. i made itthrough the physical exams, the psychologicaland psychiatric exams, the claustrophobia exam-- many, many different things-- and sort of went homewith lots of souvenirs, 'cause i figured, \"i'm gonnahave souvenirs of this.\" well, you know, in january of 1978,the call came,\n\nand said, \"are youstill interested in this job?\" and of course i was.i wasn't-- it was like coming to berkeley. i wasn't really surewhat i was getting into, but it sounded likethe most fascinating thing that a personcould do at the time. and so i joinedthe astronaut corps and started work with nasain july of 1978. so i'm gonna tell youa little bit about that.\n\nin that class,they took 35 astronauts, and six of us were women. the women who had been interviewed all thoughtthat they would take one or two women, but not six. so we were delighted that there were the six of us. we were very different.\n\nwe came from different partsof the country. we had different backgrounds,all in science-- astrophysics, geology,engineering, biochemistry, medicine. but we formed a bond, as you can imagine. we were afraidthey were gonna wash us out, that they would put barriersin our way that would seethat we didn't get to succeed.\n\nbut we were willingto support each other and to go through this together, and it turned outthat we all had a chance to fly. so it was a great groupto be a part of. you can see i'm the runtof the litter. and, in fact,it wasn't as hard being female. it was really hard being little, 'cause there were a lotof things that nasa hadn't thought of--\n\ncouldn't accommodatea 5'2\" female. the height requirement, i think,for the men, was 5'6\". and so there was a lotof equipment that they forgot didn't fita 5'2\"-- but, again, you work that out. for the first few yearsi was at nasa, the shuttle wasn't flying. remember, i was acceptedin 1978. the shuttle didn't flyuntil 1981.\n\nbut i was anxious,besides all of the training that i was going through, to get involvedin some of the life sciences and the medical operations-- experiments and teststhat were being...

(Photo courtesy of: Ontario Power Generation, Inc.)\n\nOntario, Canada plans to build two new nuclear reactors in the province to meet increasing demand for electricity.. At the same time, the government has delayed closing its existing coal plants as promised. Host Steve Curwood talks with Bob Carty, of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, about the controversial plan.\n\n\nCURWOOD: From the Jennifer and Ted Stanley Studios in Somerville, Massachusetts, this is Living on Earth. I\u2019m Steve Curwood.\n\nNuclear power is set to make a major comeback in North America. The Bush administration recently pushed a plan through Congress that grants as much as 15 billion dollars in federal aid, to jumpstart nuclear power plant construction, in the United States. And now in Canada the provincial government of Ontario has just announced it will spend 40 billion dollars to upgrade old atomic power stations and build some new ones.\n\nJoining me from Ottawa is Bob Carty. He\u2019s a senior journalist with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Hi Bob.\n\nCARTY: Hi, Steve.\n\nCURWOOD: So, Canada eventually stopped building nuclear power plants in the 90s after building a lot of them in the 60s. Why have you guys changed your minds?\n\nCARTY: Well, a number of things happened since about 93, when the last power plant went up. It had huge cost overruns, you know, we\u2019re still paying on our electricity bills for the debt of 30 billion dollars for that plant. So yes, as you say, nuclear was out of favor, but since then these things have happened: the economy boomed, demand for electricity increased, the population is growing.\n\nAt the same time, a previous conservative government cut conservation, so there were no gains happening there. So the current situation is you have a reliance upon nuclear, hydro and coal. And that\u2019s grown, actually, in recent years because there\u2019s been so many breakdowns at the CANDU nuclear reactors we have here \u2013 bursting pipes, radiation leaks and so on. Eight reactors had to be closed down to be repaired; four of them are still closed down.\n\nAnd that meant generating more and more electricity with coal, which is very polluting, contributes about 25 percent of Ontario\u2019s entire greenhouse gases, and doctors say actually perhaps kills about 1,500 people a year because of respiratory problems. So something had to be done to solve all those problems, and to keep the lights on. I don\u2019t think any of this, though, you don\u2019t see a mention, Steve, in any of the documentation of the government about this being motivated in any sense by Kyoto.\n\nCURWOOD: So explain to me this Ontario plan financially. How much is the government going to spend on nuclear and how much on renewables and conservation?\n\nCARTY: The government says this is a multi-year, 60 U.S. billion plan. Of that, a good chunk, 40 billion dollars, is going to build two new nuclear facilities and refurbish or repair four existing ones. And then they have another 20 billion dollars or so to invest in conservation, to develop more hydroelectricity, to stimulate solar, wind, biomass electricity production. It\u2019s called a balanced plan by the minister of energy, Dwight Duncan, and here\u2019s a little tape from him:\n\nDarlington Station, in southern Ontario is the potential site for new nuclear reactors. (Photo courtesy of: Ontario Power Generation, Inc.)\n\nDUNCAN: We\u2019re looking at probably two new reactors, and that is a modest plan on the nuclear side but it\u2019s a robust plan on renewables, on conservation, and on ensuring reliability as we move forward. Listen, if I had my druthers it\u2019d be 100 percent hydroelectric. Nuclear power has an important role to play; we want to balance that with other sources of electricity. We believe that this plan will provide Ontario with a stable, reliable, affordable, competitive electricity system, moving forward.\n\nCURWOOD: Now he seems to be holding his nose a bit there on the nuclear power, and likes hydro, so why doesn\u2019t he just go that way?\n\nCARTY: Well, it\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s only a certain amount of hydro resources left in Ontario. We have a long tradition in hydro-generation. The big rivers in the south \u2013 think of the St. Lawrence, you think of Niagara \u2013 they\u2019re all dammed. There are rivers in the far north of Ontario, but this is a big province and you lose a lot of power just in transmission from the north to the south.\nBut one thing that\u2019s really ironic is there could be a lot of hydro-generation on a sort of micro scale, you know, very small rivers. There could also be a reversal of a previous decision; earlier governments, conservative governments, concentrating so much on nuclear, shut down small river or medium size river dams. They took the generators out; too costly, they said, to maintain them. So critics say that, you know, you could get quite a bit of power by putting turbines back in those existing rivers.\n\nCURWOOD: Now, how has the environmental community responded to this announcement?\n\nCARTY: Well they say, first of all, that Ontario\u2019s commitment to shutting down the coal generation of electricity is a bit in doubt now. Originally it was going to be shut down next year; now it\u2019s put off at least two years, and who knows when there\u2019ll be new power in hand. So they\u2019re a bit concerned about that issue. But in terms of turning nuclear, the environmentalists say that all of Ontario\u2019s future needs could in fact be met by conservation and alternative generation. They say, look, California\u2019s done it. They\u2019ve in conservation saved as much electricity as nuclear plants of Ontario generate.\n\nHere\u2019s Keith Stewart, Steve. Keith Stewart runs the climate change campaign at the World Wildlife Federation of Canada.\n\nSTEWART: This is about a 20 percent growth in nuclear power from what we have right now on line, and we actually are seeing that consumption will continue to grow, so it\u2019s not a conservation plan. A conservation plan means you use less, not you use more, and an effective nuclear strategy right now would be to phase out what we have as they come to the end of their life because it\u2019s a technology that has gotten us into the problem we\u2019re in right now. So you shouldn\u2019t be looking at it as a way to dig yourself out.\n\nCURWOOD: Now Bob, with this expansion of nuclear, how\u2019s Canada going to handle the nuclear waste?\n\nCARTY: Well, we have about 30,000 tons of highly radioactive waste built up since the 60\u2019s, Steve, and no disposal plan at all. In fact, a sort of satirical songwriter here says it\u2019s like putting up an outhouse without digging a hole.\n\nCURWOOD: (Laughs) Okay. But really, Bob, where is the waste right now then?\n\nCARTY: It\u2019s just sitting on site. It\u2019s at the nuclear plants. It\u2019s either in containers or sitting in heavy water tanks that are on the facility there, just waiting for a plan. There\u2019ve been a lot of studies. They\u2019ve dug into the Precambrian Shield rock of Ontario and Manitoba, they\u2019ve looked at different technologies, but they haven\u2019t made the investment, they haven\u2019t made the decision, they\u2019ve put it off I guess for future generations to pay the cost.\n\nCURWOOD: Bob Carty\u2019s a senior journalist with the national radio network of Canada, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

I'm Ira Flatow.\n\nIn the thick of World War II, with the government worried about atomic experiments in Germany, the Manhattan Project was born. And it had one mission, and that was full speed ahead on research to produce the atom bomb.\n\nThere was just one problem: where to get the uranium. At the time, there were two prime sources, the first, a mine way up near the Arctic Circle, over a 1,000 miles from the nearest railway; and the other, a mine deep in the Belgian Congo.\n\nSo the Army wondered: Wasn't there any more secure, domestic source of uranium ore? And they found it, and a lot of it, all over the Navajo homeland in northeastern Arizona, which is where my next guest's book takes places.\n\nFLATOW: The book is \"Yellow Gold(ph): An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed.\" It takes us back to those wartime days of exploratory mines. Yellow gold is I keep calling it \"Yellow Dirt.\" I'm sorry: \"Yellow Dirt: American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed.\" It takes us back to those wartime days of exploratory mines, to the decades of neglect after most of the mines closed, when the Navajos unwittingly built homes out of radioactive dust and drank lake water laced with uranium right up to today, where the federal government is working to clean it all up.\n\nJudy Pasternak is the author of \"Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed.\" She's a former writer and investigative reporter for the L.A. Times. She joins us from our studios in Washington. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.\n\nMs. JUDY PASTERNAK (Author, \"Yellow Dirt\"): Hi, Ira, thanks for having me here.\n\nFLATOW: Take us back to those early days on the reservation. How was uranium discovered there? Walk us through that sequence.\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: Well, there were a couple of different things happening at the same time. One of the things that happened is that the Manhattan Project actually formed a front company, and they called it Union Mines Development Corporation.\n\nThey sent geologists out to the reservation. Their cover story was that they were looking for another mineral called vanadium that hardens steel. And they sent back cables where they found the uranium. You know, they weren't allowed to use the U-word, even though their cables were classified, and they called it S-37, SOM.\n\nFLATOW: Top secret stuff they were working on.\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: Top secret stuff. And then the other thing that happened was at the same time, those people worked for Union Carbide, which had formed a front company for the government. Then there was another company called Vanadium Corporation of America, which did mine vanadium, but they had a secret contract to siphon off uranium from vanadium or -for the Army. And they were looking also for this strange ore, and a...\n\nFLATOW: Did they enlist the Navajos to help them find it?\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: Well, the Navajos did. What happened there was an Indian trader was helping them, and he put some stones out on his counter, and about 15 miles away, there was a valley where the patriarch who had settled the place had found these strange rocks up on the mesa where he'd graze his sheep. And he called this stuff leetso, which is the Navajo word for yellow dirt.\n\nAnd he told his children not to show it to the white men, and one of his sons, though, was, you know, motivated partly by patriotism and partly by the allure of riches, not necessarily in that order, actually betrayed his father.\n\nFLATOW: Oh, so he showed it, and then this guy said wow, this is exactly what we're looking for. Where did you get this stuff?\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: Absolutely. That's what happened.\n\nFLATOW: And so did he show them the source of where it came from?\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: He sure did. He took them on a hike, a long wagon ride and then a hike. And within a year or so, there were about 100 miners blasting away at the mesa.\n\nFLATOW: And it created all sorts of problems eventually with pollution, uranium pollution and the dust falling out everywhere.\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: That's right. It was a problem first of occupational exposure for the miners and then later for the entire community at large.\n\nFLATOW: And you talk about in your book that the Navajo actually built their homes out of this radioactive dust.\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: Yeah, after the mining ended, the companies, VCA and the other companies that came in, were had clauses in their leases that said they were supposed to return the land in as good condition as received. But the federal inspectors let them go without cleaning up.\n\nAnd so there was all this ore that was nicely squared off by the blasting laying around, and there were these sandy mounds at four processing sites around Navajo, huge in this one area where the betrayal took place, they had two piles. One covered 20 acres, and one covered 10.\n\nAnd it was - the Navajos were very poor and very practical, and they discovered this stuff made really good cement. And they had these square rocks, and they used it to build foundations and floors and bread ovens and stucco walls.\n\nFLATOW: Wow, and so you recount how when some of the white people came in, they had Geiger counters, and they wow, it like went off the charts. These homes were hot.\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: Yeah, much later, in the '70s and '80s, there was an EPA guy who discovered that many of the homes in this one valley, you know, 1,600 or 1,700 homes in that valley, were very hot. And then another, about five or six years later, somebody out in the community with a television crew, who was just looking at old mines, was in a house doing an interview, and he turned his Geiger counter on, and it went off.\n\nFLATOW: Did anybody tell the Navajo miners that digging up all this uranium could give them all kinds of problems?\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: No. The Public Health Service actually examined the Navajos. The problem for them, which was well-known to the government, was that in 10 or 20 years' time, they faced a very high risk of coming down with lung cancer. So it was a down-the-road kind of thing.\n\nAnd they would actually come and do medical exams, but they were under orders not to scare away the workforce.\n\nFLATOW: And did they suspect themselves, over the years that they were working in the mine and being exposed to the dust, that this was actually harming them in some way?\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: Well, they didn't really know. There were occasional news reports in the outer world that did reach the tribal council, and they one tribal official actually asked if uranium, handling uranium was dangerous. And he was assured by some mining people and by some people from the Interior Department that there wasn't really a problem, and people that the government was looking to be sure and, you know, they'd be taken care of.\n\nFLATOW: But in fact there were all kinds of cancers that were showing up.\n\n\nFLATOW: Yeah. Tell us about this big radioactive spill, the Church Rock Spill.\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: That was in 1979. There was a mine just at the edge of the Navajo reservation proper, and just over the border, there was another processing facility run by United Nuclear.\n\nAnd United Nuclear, instead of they were actually trying not to have those mountains of sand there because by that time, people knew it could be a problem. So they dissolved theirs in water and held it in a pond.\n\nBut they had it and it was supposed to be state of the art. They had an earthen dike holding it back, but there was a breach cracks in the dike. And 93 million gallons of radioactive material spilled into an arroyo and from there into a river, the Rio Puerco that marks the southern boundary of Navajo.\n\nIt was the largest accidental release of radioactive material in U.S. history.\n\nFLATOW: And this happened right after Three Mile Island.\n\n\nFLATOW: But we heard so much about Three Mile Island, and I can't ever remember hearing about this one.\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: Well, this one, people didn't pay quite as much attention outside.\n\nFLATOW: Because?\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: Well, it was more it was more remote. You didn't have something like \"The China Syndrome,\" the movie that got everybody worried about something like Three Mile Island happening. And, you know, a packed-dirt dam cracking is not as exotic, I guess, as those cooling towers.\n\nAnd I don't know how much had to do with the fact that there were white people or Indians involved.\n\nFLATOW: And so where does it stand today with all this - you had all this water and all this radioactivity 30 years ago. You have the mines. You have the homes built out of cement made that may still be radioactive today. Has it been cleaned up? What's the state of it now?\n\nMs. PASTERNAK: Well, they're working on it. There have been efforts, in fits and starts, ... (truncated)",

The following interview took place at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California on May 22, 2006 between Keyur Patel, Project Manager of the Dawn Mission (JPL), and Education and Public Outreach team member John Ristvey from Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning (McREL).\n\nJR: What is your role in the Dawn mission?\n\nKP: I\u2019m the Dawn Project Manger. Basically, what the project manager does is he or she is responsible for the engineering and management of the project. And, in our case, Chris Russell is the PI [Principal Investigator], and he usually takes care of the science portion of the mission.\n\nJR: Sound like it\u2019s a big job, being a project manager. Can you tell us a little bit more about what that involves on your end?\n\nKP: It is a big job, but I can\u2019t do it without the rest of the team. We have the rest of the project team who are essential in making this mission happen. And, with all of us and coordination, we go work the different aspects of the project and get things done to achieve a launch.\n\nJR: Is there something like a typical workday for you\u2014something that you can describe for our audience about what a typical workday might look like? Or are they so very different from each other?\n\nKP: There is no such typical workday, but I can guarantee you, 95% of my time is spent in meetings. You\u2019re looking outwards and inwards: outwards, in the sense, where you have to keep JPL management, NASA management, program office management up to speed on what\u2019s going on; and inwards, in the sense of if there are key technical decisions that have to be made or budgetary decisions or schedule decisions that have to be made, you have to be involved with that. And, then, there\u2019s the overall statusing and keeping your pulse on the day-to-day goings-on of the project.\n\nJR: With Dawn, you have international partners. You have a science team all over the country. And, certainly, we\u2019ve had challenges with the mission itself, but are there any challenges that come with the job?\n\nKP: In our case, actually, our international interface has actually been pretty clean, at least in my administration. The instruments are actually delivered and sitting there. So, our international partners have actually fulfilled their commitment of getting their deliveries in. The issue now is getting the spacecraft hardware and the ion propulsion system all integrated and moving forward, so we can achieve a launch on June 20th.\n\nJR: Any other challenges with the job? Personnel? You have a wonderful staff to work with. Communications?\n\nKP: No. Everything else is just business as usual. This is my\u2014how would you put it\u2014this is my third job in a row where I\u2019ve showed up 12 months before launch, so I\u2019m kind of getting old at this.\n\nJR: Tell me a little bit more about your work history. You\u2019ve been at JPL for 20 years now\u2014can you share some of that history?\n\nKP: I actually started at JPL when I was a junior in college. When I graduated, I was actually the AACS or the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem Cognizant Engineer for Voyager Spacecraft for Neptune Encounter. Then, I moved on from there onto Mars Observer and spent time on Mars Observer until it failed. After it failed, [I] led a team of people who were responsible for doing all the testing and analysis for the three different standing review boards that were established to find out what caused the failure. After that, I went into line management for a number of years. Then, [I]came out of line management and was the product engineer and flight system manager on a project called Starlight, which was the first, formation-flying, space interferometer\u2014after that, SIRTF, Deep Impact , and now Dawn.\n\nJR: Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on this, Mars Observer was functioning really well right up until insertion.\n\nKP: Right up until the tank was pressurized just before orbit insertion. I get the phone call at home saying, \u2018Did you guys see anything in the analysis and testing you were doing in the test bed?\u2019 \u2018No, why?\u2019 \u2018We haven\u2019t heard from it.\u2019 Functioning was beautiful.\n\nJR: Tell me a little bit more about working at JPL. Seems like an exciting place to work\u2014what do you find interesting about working there?\n\nKP: What I find most interesting is [that] no two jobs are the same. The history I just went through with the flight projects I worked on\u2014it\u2019s not the third version of the same thing. Every one is a unique challenge on its own\u2014unique technical challenge on its own. That just keeps you excited and motivated on doing what you do.\n\nJR: You said this is the third mission that you\u2019ve come in 12 months prior to launch, and each one is unique with its own works and challenges about it; but are there certain things that have to happen?\n\nKP: There are certain things that have to happen\u2014you kind of build up a set of approaches on solving the problem. If it\u2019s worked for you in the past, you want to use it because it\u2019s going to work for you in the future. But the technical problem each mission throws at you is quite different, and you have to use all your tools and wits to get through them.\n\nJR: Share with us some unique aspects of the Dawn mission. You mentioned that each one is a little bit unique. Are there any specific things that you are seeing as part of the Dawn mission that make it unique?\n\nKP: Dawn is unique in the sense [that] it\u2019s the first major use of an ion propulsion system for a deep space mission, and it is that system that had some of the technical challenges that caused the mission to be stood-down and looked at by the independent assessment team. Because of that, we have to pay very special attention to make sure we technically answer all the questions regarding the ion propulsion system, and do what\u2019s right before we deliver that hardware for integration.\n\nJR: Since reinstatement, you\u2019ve been re-establishing your teams and pulling people back on. How has that been going as far as getting back up from a \u2018stand-down\u2019 to a \u2018cancel\u2019 to a \u2018reinstatement\u2019 and then back up again?\n\nKP: It\u2019s actually going quite smoothly because both institutions, JPL and Orbital, are both committed to making this happen\u2014in fact, more than trying. They are in full support of bringing back the people that were on the project to begin with and then, they are letting the project handpick individuals for certain jobs and reassigning them from other jobs to make this mission successful.\n\nJR: Can you tell us a little bit more about what you do when you\u2019re not managing the Dawn mission? Do you have other responsibilities at JPL?\n\nKP: This is my primary mission; I have no other responsibilities at JPL. Dawn is it.\n\nJR: Can you tell us a little bit about your career path that led you to become a project manager? Tell us a little about your background prior to coming to JPL as a project manager.\n\nKP: I was in college. I have no background. This is the only place I have ever worked. In fact, it is by sheer accident I got into the space business, because my entire college history and study history is airplanes\u2014aerodynamics. I started working here in the summer, and I\u2019ve never looked back at an airplane yet.\n\nJR: So you say it\u2019s an accident\u2014you had some interest in aeronautics.\n\nKP: I had a huge interest in aerospace engineering, but it was more geared toward airplanes than spacecraft or astrodynamics-type stuff.\n\nJR: If we go back further in time\u2014high school, college\u2014what subjects interested you most when you were in school?\n\nKP: Math and Science have always interested me when I was in school\u2014both grade school and high school. Being in this field, that\u2019s a given for most engineers, in the sense that there was always some interest or something that was the \u2018great attractor\u2019 that brought you to math and science. And, you just carried it forward from there.\n\nJR: Within the fields of math and science, were there any particular disciplines that captured your interest?\n\nKP: In science, it was physics. In math, it was just math, in general\u2014it was just very interesting.\n\nJR: When you were younger, did you have any favorite books as a child, or what did you enjoy doing as hobbies?\n\nKP: I don\u2019t think I had favorite books as a child, but I had favorite genres, which I loved to read. One thing, somehow or another, I got so addicted on World War II history books, in the sense of the great battles\u2014sea battles and land battles. And then, of course, science fiction\u2014that was like anything that was science fiction I was reading, pretty much.\n\nJR: Did you have a favorite teacher or mentor who maybe inspired you to get into the math and science fields? Is there anybody along the way who made a difference in your life? That made you think \u2018this is what I want to do\u2019?\n\nKP: If you look back, my family, on my father\u2019s side\u2014it was a large family\u2014and all of the brothers in his family were all engineers, So, it pretty much starts at home with my parents, in the sense of them guiding me and letting me do what I wanted to do. I ended up doing the same thing that my dad was doing.\n\nJR: Tell me a little bit more about that.\n\nKP: Sorry, I should be a little more precise. I ended up doing similar to what my dad was doing. My dad was an engineer, also, but he wasn\u2019t an aerospace engineer.\n\nJR: Are any of your family members still in the field?\n\nKP: They\u2019re in the field. My uncle was a civil engineer, and my brother is actually a physician. In fact, I started out as a physician in school. Then, I got bored with the rote memorization that I had to do, so I decided to switch to something that didn\u2019t require a lot of memorizing.\n\nJR: Do you have any \u2018yet to be achieved\u2019 life goals?\n\nKP: Well, one, I think just about everybody aims for\u2014probably to retire early and do a whole lot more traveling than quite possible in the business we\u2019re in\u2014traveling at a personal level, not traveling for busines...
