Here we have it, as the rumour mill suggested, Google has released the On2 VP8 video codec as open source (royalty free, BSD-style), while also launching the WebM container format which combines a VP8 video stream with Vorbis audio. Support for WebM has been enabled on YouTube's HTML5 beta, and you can download patches against ffmpeg as well as DirectShow filters for Windows (Gstreamer plugins are labelled as \"coming soon\"). Mac users are out of luck for now; no QuickTime plugins have been announced yet. Update: The WebM blog is now open - and the list of partners is pretty decent already. It includes ARM, NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm, and many others. Update II: VP8 will be baked into Flash. Update III: The Opera labs version with WebM support has been released too, for Linux, Mac, and Windows.\nThread beginning with comment 425503\nTo view parent comment, click here.\nTo read all comments associated with this story, please click here.\nRE[2]: Awesome news.\nby DigitalAxis on Wed 19th May 2010 20:57 UTC in reply to \"RE: Awesome news.\"\nMember since:\n\nHopefully, if Froyo will be able to support Flash\/h264 video on current devices, Gingerbread will be able to support WebM on those same current devices.\n\nI'd hate to spring for an Android handset now and find out I'm crippled due to lack of hardware acceleration.\n\nReply Parent Score: 2",

        "text":"About Budak Ransomware virus\n\nThe ransomware known as Budak Ransomware is classified as a very damaging infection, due to the amount of damage it could cause. It is likely you\u2019ve never come across ransomware before, in which case, you may be particularly shocked. Ransomware can use powerful encryption algorithms for the encryption process, which prevents you from accessing them any longer. The reason this malware is thought to be a serious threat is because it is not always possible to decrypt files. You do have the choice of paying the ransom but that is not the wisest idea. Budak Ransomware\n\nThere are numerous cases where files were not decrypted even after victims comply with the demands. Think about what\u2019s preventing cyber criminals from just taking your money. You ought to also keep in mind that the money will be used for malicious software projects in the future. Data encoding malware is already costing a fortune to businesses, do you really want to be supporting that. And the more people comply with the demands, the more profitable ransomware gets, and that attracts many people to the industry. Consider investing that money into backup instead because you might end up in a situation where data loss is a possibility again. And you could just remove Budak Ransomware without worry. You may find details on how to safeguard your device from this threat in the below paragraph, if you\u2019re not sure about how the ransomware even got into your computer.\n\nHow did you acquire the ransomware\n\nA file encoding malicious program generally travels through methods like email attachments, malicious downloads and exploit kits. Seeing as these methods are still quite popular, that means that users are pretty negligent when they use email and download files. More sophisticated methods might be used as well, although not as frequently. Criminals write a pretty credible email, while pretending to be from some legitimate company or organization, attach the infected file to the email and send it off. Those emails commonly mention money because that is a delicate topic and users are more likely to be impulsive when opening money related emails. It is quite frequent that you\u2019ll see big company names like Amazon used, for example, if Amazon sent an email with a receipt for a purchase that the user did not make, he\/she wouldn\u2019t wait to open the file attached. Be on the lookout for certain signs before opening files attached to emails. Before opening the file attached, look into the sender of the email. And if you do know them, double-check the email address to make sure it matches the person\u2019s\/company\u2019s legitimate address. Also, look for mistakes in grammar, which usually tend to be quite evident. You should also take note of how you are addressed, if it\u2019s a sender who knows your name, they\u2019ll always greet you by your name, instead of a universal Customer or Member. Some file encoding malware could also use unpatched software on your device to enter. All software have vulnerabilities but when they\u2019re discovered, they\u2019re normally fixed by software creators so that malware cannot take advantage of it to infect. Unfortunately, as as could be seen by the widespread of WannaCry ransomware, not all people install updates, for various reasons. We recommend that you install a patch whenever it becomes available. Updates could install automatically, if you find those notifications annoying.\n\nHow does it behave\n\nSoon after the ransomware infects your system, it\u2019ll look for certain file types and once they\u2019ve been found, it\u2019ll lock them. Even if what happened was not clear from the beginning, you will definitely know something is wrong when you cannot open your files. All encoded files will have a file extension attached to them, which aids people in identifying which ransomware specifically has infected their computer. Unfortunately, files might be permanently encoded if a strong encryption algorithm was used. A ransom notification will alert you that your files have been encoded and what you need to do next. The proposed a decryption tool will not be for free, of course. Ransom amounts are generally specified in the note, but in some cases, victims are requested to email them to set the price, it might range from some tens of dollars to possibly a couple of hundred. Evidently, paying the ransom isn\u2019t suggested. Only consider complying with the demands when you have attempted everything else. Maybe you simply don\u2019t recall making copies. Or, if you\u2019re lucky, a free decryption software may be available. A decryptors could be available for free, if the file encoding malware was decryptable. Before you decide to pay, look for a decryptor. It would be wiser to purchase backup with some of that money. And if backup is an option, you may recover files from there after you uninstall Budak Ransomware virus, if it still remains on your device. If you familiarize yourself with data encoding malware is distributed, you should be able to avoid future infections of this type. At the very least, don\u2019t open email attachments left and right, keep your programs updated, and only download from sources you know you can trust.\n\nBudak Ransomware removal\n\nIf the file encrypting malicious program still remains, an anti-malware software will be required to get rid of it. When trying to manually fix Budak Ransomware virus you might bring about additional harm if you aren\u2019t the most computer-savvy person. Using a malware removal tool would be much less bothersome. These kinds of programs are made with the intention of detecting or even blocking these types of infections. Look into which anti-malware program would best match what you require, download it, and allow it to scan your device for the infection once you install it. The software won\u2019t help recover your files, however. If you are sure your system is clean, restore files from backup, if you have it.\n\n\nMore information about WiperSoft and Uninstall Instructions. Please review WiperSoft EULA and Privacy Policy.

        "text":"Viewpoint: \u201cThe Lost Honour\u201d of dying Google+\n\nBy Joshua Madden\nA&E Editor\n\nThink back to this past summer for a minute. I know it\u2019s hard to do with the weather finally starting to get chilly here in Waco, but reflect on those sunny days. The time spent lounging by the pool. The time when Google+ was supposed to be the Facebook killer.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that seem like forever ago?\n\nGoogle+, Google\u2019s most recent attempt at creating a viable social network, appears to be dead in the water. I was only even reminded of its existence because of an e-mail I got informing me that Google Wave, Google\u2019s previous half-hearted attempt at creating some kind of social experience online, was being shut down. The question I had to ask myself was this: How long until Google+ follows suit?\n\nWhen Google+ was first released, I\u2019ll admit it intrigued me. The Android app was solid. The invite-only feature made me feel special. The fact that it wasn\u2019t blocked everywhere with a proxy gave it a leg up over Facebook.\n\nThe problem, of course, was that it still wasn\u2019t Facebook. All of my friends were on Facebook. Even with Google+, 1,083 of my friends are still there. I don\u2019t even have 100 friends on Google+.\n\nNobel laureate Heinrich B\u00f6ll\u2019s \u201cThe Lost Honour of Katharina Blum\u201d follows the beautiful Katharina. Everything appears to be going her way until she falls in love with a murderer and quickly finds herself under investigation from the authorities.\n\nThe book is one of my all-time favorites, partially because of the fact that it speaks to something larger than the story contained within the pages. Who hasn\u2019t seen something beautiful (like Katharina) find itself in trouble because of a few careless mistakes?\n\nObviously there is some debate about whether or not Ms. Blum is actually to blame for her downfall \u2014 you\u2019ll have to read the book so you can decide for yourself \u00ad\u2014 but I personally thought that part of her problem is that she was too arrogant and thought too highly of herself. Could there be a more direct parallel to Google+ and its rapid decline in popularity?\n\nThe reason that no one shifted from Facebook to Google+ was that there was no reason to shift from Facebook to Google+. Google+ had no notable features that Facebook did not have and Google executives seemed to think that we should all move over simply because we love Google, even though many of those executives did not appear to embrace the site themselves.\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, I do love Google. I think it\u2019s clearly the best search engine on the Internet and it makes it so easy to bring disparate things together. This was, however, the exact reason that I was never sold on Google+. All of the characteristic ease of use of Google Non-Plus didn\u2019t seem to make its way over to Google+. That\u2019s too bad.\n\nI write this column not to rejoice in the downfall of Google+, but to mourn it. There are serious privacy issues with Facebook that I\u2019m not convinced will ever be adequately addressed.\n\nI want Google+ to succeed and I think there is still a chance to make that happen. But it\u2019s going to take some real effort. They might start by taking their own \u201c+1\u201d concept to heart. Why can\u2019t Google+ one-up Facebook?\n\nFacebook is often slow to address issues that people would like to see addressed. Why is it that years after its initial implementation, the \u201cLike\u201d button on Facebook remains alone? Why is it that we don\u2019t have \u201cDislike\u201d buttons or \u201cLove\u201d buttons? Even Xanga had varied amounts of \u201ceProps\u201d that could be left for users.\n\nThese are easy areas that Google+ could have capitalized on, but instead, they chose only to give us a slightly more muddled version of the \u201cLike\u201d button.\n\nIf we\u2019re going to shift over to Google+, we need a reason to do so. The Google brand will get me to sign up, but it won\u2019t get me to stay there, especially when my 1,083 friends are staying on Facebook.\n\nThinking that you\u2019re more important than my 1,083 friends makes me think you and Katharina Blum might have something in common.\n\nPlease send comments to",
