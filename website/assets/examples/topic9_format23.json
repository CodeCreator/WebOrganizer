        "text":"Mascotbridge Pty Ltd Testimonial\n\nBy February 21, 2017Testimonials\n\nDale Edwards has been my personal accountant and trusted business advisor for several years. During this time, Leon and the Advivo team, has helped me and my wife manage the bookkeeping and finances of my business, Mascotbridge Pty Ltd.\n\nWhat I appreciate most about Advivo is the added value they provide. For example, they offer free seminars that are aimed at exposing different ways of thinking and managing a business. I just recently attended a seminar that had speakers who discussed the importance of developing a business transition plan and the way to begin the process.\n\nI found this seminar very helpful as it gave me the confidence I needed to proceed with developing a transition plan. I learnt that there are logical processes you can take to exit a business and it does not have to be left to the last minute. Essentially, Advivo has made this entire process more manageable and approachable.\n\nDale introduced Leon and we are now in the beginning stage of developing a transition plan for my business. I am very impressed with the process thus far as Advivo\u2019s approach is sensible and logical. I am already seeing positive outcomes in terms of sourcing a potential buyer and revaluing the business\u2019s assets.\n\nAs a whole, I am very impressed with Advivo\u2019s wide ranging services. They are not just a one stop shop, the team will always go the extra mile to ensure you and your business are on the right to path to success.\n\nShare This Post:\nSocial media & sharing icons powered by UltimatelySocial",

        "text":"The Entrepreneur Club: Early March New Year Networking Event Review\n\nBy March 6, 2018 Business\n\nMyself and my colleague, Ruby, attended the Entrepreneur Club: Early March New Year Networking Event on Thursday the 1st of March. The event was a meet up for professional individuals who are on their journey to achieving their entrepreneurial goals. It was organised to allow new entrepreneurs to connect with people on the same journey and share their stories.\n\nThe event was located at Spice Market in Collins Street. The venue was not the most suitable location, the lighting was very dim, there were not enough seats and the small area that the event was contained in made it awkward for people not currently in conversations to join existing ones.\n\nMost of the people who attended were currently in-between jobs and were looking for positions. The rest of the crowd either worked in or owned a small business. Most people that myself and Ruby spoke to had an entrepreneurial idea that they wanted to develop in the future.\n\nThe event and conversations we had with the attendees taught us that there are many people with great ideas for start-ups that just require consulting to turn their light bulb moments into real and practical steps.\n\nI would not re-attend this event. Although it was interesting to meet a diverse range of people, I did not enjoy the location, there was no food provided and I do not believe there was a synergy between the individuals.\n\n\nThings of note:\n\n  \u2022 Location: Spice Market\n  \u2022 Highlight: Meeting new people\n  \u2022 Cost: Free\n  \u2022 Hot Tip: Eat beforehand!\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Venue: 1 \/ 5\n  \u2022 Catering: 0 \/ 5\n  \u2022 Speaker: 0 \/ 5\n  \u2022 Networking Opportunity: 1 \/ 5\n\nTotal: 2 \/ 20\n\n\nMegan Nolan\n\nAuthor Megan Nolan\n\nMore posts by Megan Nolan",

That's why I made a deal for a newer car with Prestige Financial, even though logic told me 20+% and a service agreement of $3000 tacked on to the loan didn't seem that appealing. The used car payments now total almost $20,000. The payment seemed fairly reasonable, which I thought I could live with. But, I lost the good job I had after several months & could not make the payments. They were okay with it the first month, but when I got two months behind they started to make threatening comments. My assets are nil and income is now only $1500\/month, yet they want to garnish a % of my wages(more than the payment), even though I have offered to surrender the car to them. They've already made several thousand dollars in interest on the loan.\nI found out from someone with many years in the car business that these banks that do substandard loans always get full retail for the car and tack on as much as they can to get their money rapidly out of the loan. They have already made more off me and my loan than they would from some rich guy. There ought to be a law against charging excessive interest to someone who is trying to recover from financial difficulty, yet they just pile on as much as legally possible. I have checked with several dealers who tell me I owe several thousand more than the car is worth, so I am stuck either way.\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nThis report was posted on Ripoff Report on 01\/07\/2008 02:18 PM and is a permanent record located here: http:\/\/www.ripoffreport.com\/r\/Prestige-Financial\/Salt-Lake-City-Utah-84115\/Prestige-Financial-Turned-down-by-several-car-companies-and-ripped-off-at-buy-here-pay-he-297805.
