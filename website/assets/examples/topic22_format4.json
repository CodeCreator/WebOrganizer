In most cases, the main culprit is the level sensor. On BMWs with reservoirs mounted on the left or right wheel wells, BMW used a two wire sensor. If the reservoir is full and coolant low light is on, remove the level sensor connector and use a small piece of wire to connect between the terminals. If the light goes off the wiring is good, but the sensor is bad. For your question of what type of coolant to use. The main concern is that what ever brand you use (BMW, Everex, Peak, Prestone, etc), it MUST be phosphate free. This is a must because of the engine's cast iron block, aluminum heads, and the radiator's plastic\/aluminum makeup. Today, most major brands are phosphate free and able to mix with other brands.\n\nBig Boyz with Bad Toyz\n\nAll times are GMT -7.

How much money would it take to build 3-foot bicycle lanes on any new roads or roads that are to be repaired, and why doesn't the city or state do that instead of allowing cyclists in roadways?\n\nA. Steve Dinges from the City Planning department said the standard for bike lanes is 4 feet. Adding bike lanes to most existing roads would require additional right of way and would damage the value of adjoining property, he said. The cost of these bike lanes would be approximately $650,000 per mile.\n\nDinges said the city is planning to include bike lanes on new construction of city projects in the future, including Old Monrovia Road, Meridian Street, Church Street and Slaughter Road. Any roads built with shoulders will have pavement to allow bikes.\n\n\nTyler said...\n\nwith the 40 million over budget spent on the jail addition we could have constructed 61 miles of bike lanes it doesn't seem very expensive when put into those terms\n\nPeter said...\n\nI wrote back to the Times asking them to report on the cheaper alternatives such as sharrows where he expense of widening roads for bike lanes isn't even a factor. Hopefully, they will inform the public about this cost as well.\n\nBello Velo said...\n\nOp ed them!!!\n\nclintpatty said...\n\nI think Jamie said she is looking at sub-$30k miles on those cheaper alternative.\n\nBello Velo said...\n\nYes but this needs to be addressed in the paper. the public will not go for this and frankly I am not sure I would.\n\nSharrows need to be explained.\n\nTick Tock Tick Tock",

        "text":"Motorcycle lighting upgrade ensures other drivers know you\u2019re\u00a0there\n\n\n[Pete Mills] recently bought himself a motorcycle, and as people are known to do, they start trying to scare him with gruesome stories of cycling accidents once they hear about his purchase. While he tries to shrug them off as people simply not minding their own business, something must have resonated with him, because he started tinkering with the bike\u2019s taillight in order to ensure he was always seen by other drivers.\n\nHe swapped out his motorcycle\u2019s incandescent taillight for a smart LED-based lamp that he constructed using perfboard. Not only does his new brake light feature ultra bright LEDs, but the onboard ATtiny85 rapidly flashes the lights each time he hits the brakes, making his presence impossible to miss. Before everyone starts with the claims of, \u201cFlashing red lights are illegal!\u201d, let\u2019s all take a deep breath and read on.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen these sorts of lights on the back of motorcycles for years, though being a careful guy, [Pete] wrote to the state of Michigan in order to ensure that his modifications won\u2019t get him pulled over. He has yet to hear back, but in the meantime, he merely needs to start the bike with the brakes applied to trigger the ATtiny85 to run the lights in \u201cnormal mode.\u201d\n\nContinue reading to see a short demo video of his brake light mod in action.\n\n\n  1. BadHaddy says:\n\n    The CHMSL (middle tail lamp) on my SRT8 blinks for a full second when I hit the brakes on my car, and the hazards come on when I really wail on the brakes. I suspect he would be fine, so long as it doesn\u2019t constantly blink.\n\n    \u2022 Rob says:\n\n\n      well, that\u2019s almost the idea I had :)\n\n    \u2022 Tony says:\n\n      When eye-level brake lights started to be added to cars, they all blinked a few times then stayed on as you described. The idea was the blinking attracted attention.\n\n      Somewhere along the way it stopped happening, I\u2019ve no idea why.\n\n      These days you might be better off arranging the LEDs into a Facebook \u2018Like\u2019 symbol to get noticed.\n\n  2. Rob says:\n\n    I\u2019ve always thought it would be useful to flash the stop lamp in proportion to how hard the driver is braking.\n\n    that is, slow flash before solid = easy brake\n    fast flash before solid = hard braking\n\n    then again\u2026 if everyone in front of you has flashing tail lights it may be a problem.\n\n    \u2022 Hirudinea says:\n\n      Not a bad idea, maybe we need to amend the traffic laws, also I need one of these for my bike!\n\n    \u2022 bockyPT says:\n\n      I\u2019ve thought about this and I think the best way to make other drivers aware of how much you\u2019re braking is by varying the amount of LEDs that light up on the middle lamp, starting from the middle, like this:\n\n      light Breaking: _____OOOO_____\n      Medium breaking: __OOOOOOOO__\n      Heavy breaking: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\n      ( _ = LED off, O = LED on)\n\n    \u2022 Erin Gossamer says:\n\n      While it\u2019s a good idea, there are some flaws. The biggest of which is that if you have terrible brakes, you may have to slam on your brake just to slow down, and if you have amazingly responsive brakes, you may not be giving enough warning to the driver behind you with not so good brakes.\n\n      \u2022 Grazz256 says:\n\n        Learning algorithm? Hardest braking from the last 5 drives is considered max braking. The real fun part would be if (no idea if it is or not..) the pedal is actually on a curve.\n\n      \u2022 SolderSimon says:\n\n        Use the brake lever switch, as in this design, but use it to activate an accelerometer. Sense the deceleration and vary the intensity of the brake light with the force of deceleration. Just another idea but might be be plagued by false readings if not done carefully.\n\n  3. Mad Myche says:\n\n    I love doing LED conversions for these types of things.\n\n    While most officers will not notice much less pull him over; this modification most likely is illegal. The certification stamp on the lamp assembly is basd upon that old fashioned filament lamp, and without that lamp the certification is null and void\n\n  4. Addidis says:\n\n    I would think you would be more likely to get run down with crazy bright lights flashing B-dazzling the drivers around you then using normal lights and being careful. It looks cool but my bet is this puts you at more risk. One bright flash would probably work better it would grab attention but not b-dazzle people, by the time their eyes got to it it would be a normal bike light.\n\n  5. rasz says:\n\n    socketed chip on a bike = bad idea\n\n    \u2022 bio says:\n\n\n      i have to tighten every screw and bolt every 6 months on my ninja 1000 and i have lost a few still (luckily there just standard imperial)\n\n    \u2022 bio says:\n\n      i have gotten cars impounded for flashing red lights before \u2026 one even ticked at the speed of the hazards and on the back and still\n\n      what you want is to put a high brightness red LED on the back and point it up at about 20* above 0 rifle \u2026 this will flash in the drivers eye if there to close without physically flashing the light \u2026 shutter covers work well to \u2026 worse case if someone is stupid and dickish enough to tailgate you on a bike just either pull off to the side or run the light \u2026 taking your butt off the seat and leaning a bit forward when stopped is also good habbet\n\n      \u2022 bio says:\n\n        HAD this is the secound time in chrome it has posted a comment as a reply after i replied >_>\n\n      \u2022 Malikaii says:\n\n        It does that to everyone. If you want to reply to someone\u2019s post, it is better to click the Reply button so that it opens in a new tab. When you finish replying, close that tabe and you will be able to post like normal. It shouldn\u2019t be necessary, but it works.\n\n  6. Matt says:\n\n    Good idea until he gets rear ended by an epileptic\u2026\n\n  7. N0LKK says:\n\n    LOL most vehicle are required to have flashing red lights on the rear, call hazard warning flashers.All this does is automates tapping the brake to make the lights flash. I really doubt anyone who sees this flash going to think modified light. Some States do have a requirement that tail lights be visible at a certain distance, that\u2019s the first thing that came to my mind when I read the name of the post. Not even close to mimicking an emergency vehicle. In the event such equipped vehicle is subject to an annual inspection it would be a good idea to install the standard bulb and unhook the LED prior to inspection.\n\n  8. Robot says:\n\n    I very much understand the motivation behind this hack; the modification seems effective but glare can be a real hazard, especially for older drivers. One thing that may be helpful would be to include additional LEDs that project a red patch of light behind the bike to give the illusion of the bike being car sized.\n\n    We tend to see only what we expect to see. When looking for a car; we often look for the pair of headlights or taillights. I\u2019ve noted that motorcyclists here in California ride side by side and I am sure that habit increases their visibility. To that end; a tail light that could somehow mimic the look of the backside of a car would be great.\n\n    \u2013 Robot\n\n\n\n  9. steven says:\n\n    First, flashing brakelights are nothing new, if you don\u2019t want to make your own, you can but one of these\u2026\n\n    Second, Legal? YMMV, check with yor states\u2019 department of motor vehicles (or what ever your state calls it). I know they\u2019re ok in my state, I don\u2019t know about yours.\n\n    Third, I\u2019d bet there\u2019d be more problem with it not being \u201cDOT approved\u201d.\n\n    But, what do I know?\n\n  10. BB says:\n\n    I hate to rain on his parade, because it is a cool project, but it won\u2019t matter what you do to \u201cbe seen\u201d car drivers won\u2019t see you.\n\n  11. fightcube says:\n\n    Looking at the operation of your tail light\u2026 I would be annoyed by it. It\u2019s already too damn bright on my computer monitor. I can\u2019t imagine what it will look like at night as I drive behind you and you keep pumping the brake. So\u2026 I looked up the MI law. Only thing I can see about flashing brake lights is this:\n\n    \u201cA stop lamp or signal lamp shall not project a glaring or dazzling light.\u201d\n\n    So you\u2019ll probably get a ticket\u2026\n\n  12. Matt says:\n\n    I\u2019ve seen some buses with brake lights that do like 4 flashes at 10Hz before staying on constantly.\n\n    I\u2019ve thought about doing something similar for my bicycle, in which case traffic laws are unlikely to matter. Where I live traffic laws do apply to bikes, but most police officers won\u2019t waste their time pulling over a bike. I have a bunch of blinking tail lights right now, and I don\u2019t think anyone would question that they improve safety.visibility of the bike.\n\n    Here\u2019s what I want from a set of bike lights:\n    -Bright enough to be seen in the day. Right now only one or two of my lights is bright enough\n    -Mounted as high as possible. Most of my current lights are mounted close to hub level.\n    -Large area of light. I\u2019ve found that single isolated LEDs are not very visible, no matter how bright. It\u2019s much better to have something with the surface area of a typical car brake light or head light if possible.\n    -Removable rechargeable battery\n    -Theft resistant and waterproof\n\n    If I ever get around to making something, I\u2019ll post it here for sure!\n\n    \u2022 Matt says:\n\n      I just saw a police motorcycle that does the 10hz flashing when the rider applies the brakes. Sure it\u2019s a police motorcycle, but I don\u2019t think this is necessarily a \u201cpolice only\u201d feature.\n\n  13. Alex says:\n\n    I would like to see a comparison between the signal lights and the brake light. It\u2019s very difficult to tell how bright that light is otherwise.\n\n    The main reason I mention this is because I have investigated LED conversions for automotive lighting, and it seemed that it would take far too many\/too large LEDs to put out the required amount of light in a wide pattern.\n\n  14. ino says:\n\n    As I ride every day of the year, when I need to slowdown fast, hence warn the driver behind me, I have the habit to pull the ...

You can mill a S\/R head down to the intake valve seat edge and or the spark plug hole boss. Which ever comes first. That is the physical flat mill limit. Should be able to get to 69cc with that.\n\n\"and have them ported\" Porting S\/R cast iron heads is time consuming and labour cost prohibitive.\n\nThese heads, like most stock heads are not worth paying someone else to port them. Its a do it your self thing or else its just not cost effective.\nUnless you do the porting yourself and pay some one just whats required to finish them up with required machine work, its cheaper and more cost effective to just buy a aftermarket head that flows the numbers you want.\nPoint well taken I probebly could mill them, more than what they are, but i plan to leave it alone for now. Maybe in the not so distent future, i'll be able to land a set of alluminum heads and i'll go from there.\n03-12-2008 10:12 PM\nOriginally Posted by F-BIRD'88\nThe 180cc Dart Iron Eagles are a inferior outdated design when stacked up to the comparable competition. They don't flow well\nfor a 180cc port head. They are not like the newer improved Dart Platinum\/Pro 1 series 200+cc ports. There is no improved 180cc \"Platinum\" IE head. Pick a better 180ish cc head. Every other popular 180cc head and many smaller 170ish port heads flow better than these heads in stock form.\n\nThe Intake port only flows 208cfm @28\". Thats weak for a 180cc port SBC head.\nThats why you see them advertised for cheap(er).\nNothing against the Dart Cylinder Heads in general. It's just that these specific heads are a bit of a dissapointment.\nIt takes a good bit of hand porting to get them up to what the other competitive 180cc heads flow in \"out of the box\" form. Now the port is 180cc++ volume.\nYou might as well start with a stock or \"S\/R Torker\" or \"S\/S\" head and port them.\n\nIf it was my engine I would Fully port your WP S\/R torker heads and mill them to 68-69cc chamber volume. They respond very well to this.\nPoint well taken The S\/R 76cc heads i bought could only be milled a total of .021 which was on the spread sheet that came with the heads. I had them milled .007 because they needed cleaned up, yes they where whorped. So if i do anything i'll just get another set of bare castings with 67cc chambers, and have them ported.\n03-11-2008 06:55 PM\nOriginally Posted by gregb\nAccording to the calculator I use you have a DCR of 7.51. You can read up on it here\nThanks for the link (gregb) It tells me that im atleast within range, and if i wanted to change out to a set of 180cc Dart Iron eagle 72cc heads milled down to 70cc i believe would yield 9.5:1 cr should'nt hurt me much but might be better.\n03-11-2008 06:18 PM\ngregb According to the calculator I use you have a DCR of 7.51. You can read up on it here\n03-11-2008 05:03 PM\n? about DCR for my 350 sbc\n\nI was pokeing around a few sites and read a little about DCR which im not fully sure about. I know my 350 sbc, has 9.0:1 SCR, but i dont know what the DCR is, which is what i want to learn more about. It is to my understanding that its suppose to be in the range of 7.5 to 8.5 for a street motor. I dont know what mine is, and would like to know if anyone could tell me. The motor is a 350 sbc, with stock crank and rods, plus KB120 .030 hiper flattop pistons= .007cc valve reliefs, that are .010 in the hole. The heads are WP S\/R torquers = 75cc, beehive springs, 2.02-1.60 valves, and 170cc intake runners. The head gaskets are GM Performance .028 composset to give me a .038 quench. The cam is a retro-roller from Comp = EX270HR = 495in-502ex = 218in-224ex = 110 LSA. When i dialed the cam in, i used a 9 keyway timing set which was set on the (0) mark. If my motor is not in the 7.5 to 8.5 range, what could i do to change it.
