Resentful at being left alone, she attempts to bargain with God pitting the life of her pet rabbit against that of her brother; he never returns.

Published along with five other short stories, it won the National Book Award in 1960. He again received that award in 1995 for \u201cSabbath\u2019s Theater.\u201d\n\nRoth, who has written some 25 novels, told Les Inrocks that he had always found writing difficult and that he wanted nothing more to do with reading, writing or talking about books.\n\nHe said that when he was 74, he started re-reading his favorite novels by authors Ernest Hemingway, Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and others, and then re-read his own novels.\n\nRoth\u2019s four most recent novels, \u201cEveryman,\u201d \u201cIndignation,\u201d \u201cThe Humbling\u201d and \u201cNemesis\u201d, have been short works, often focusing on ageing, physical decline, depression and death.\n\nNew Jersey-born Roth is best known for his semi-autobiographical and unreliable alter-ego Nathan Zuckerman, who appeared in nine of his novels.\n\nRoth told Les Inrocks that he had spent most of his time in recent years preparing material for his biographer, Blake Bailey. \u201cIf I had a choice, I would prefer that there is no biography written about me, but there will be biographies after my death so (I wanted) to be sure that one of them is correct,\u201d Roth was quoted as saying.\n\nRoth said he had asked his literary executors and his agent to destroy his personal archives after his death once Bailey has finished the biography. \u201cI don\u2019t want my personal papers hanging around everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\n(Reporting By Eric Kelsey and Jill Serjeant in Los Angeles)\n\n\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on and Facebook.

        "text":"#18YearsBattleOfHogwarts: JK Rowling and Harry Potter fans remember final battle\n\nBattle of Hogwarts\nMany favourite characters died in the last battle Credit: Warner Bros\n\nIt's been 18 years since the Battle of Hogwarts in Harry Potter time - the fateful fight between good and evil took place on the 2nd May 1998.\n\nMany favourite characters died in the last battle of the book series, and JK Rowling has started marking each anniversary with an apology for a favourite character death.\u00a0\n\nThis time, she apologised for killing everyone's favourite werewolf, Remus Lupin. The bedraggled ex-Defense Against The Dark Arts Teacher was adored by fans, and when the gentle and kind man was killed, many tears were shed.\n\nSignificant characters who died in the Battle of Hogwarts\n\nRemus Lupin\n\nLupin, one of Harry Potter's mentors, managed to survive Lord Voldemort's wrath right up until the last battle. Sadly, the Order of the Phoenix member, who ordered and lead groups of wizards to fight the Death Eaters, died at the Battle of Hogwarts. He was killed by Death Eater Antonin Dolohov.\n\nBellatrix Lestrange\n\nAlthough evil, insane Bellatrix was quite likeable for a death eater. The witch obsessively tried to murder Harry Potter and his allies, and managed to kill her estranged sister's daughter, Nymphadora Tonks at the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nHowever, she was eventually killed by Molly Weasley after trying to murder Ginny Weasley with a curse.\n\nVoldemort\/Tom Riddle\n\nLord Voldemort, the main villain of the series didn't inspire much sorrow when he was killed by the hero, Harry Potter, after a stand-off.\n\nSeverus Snape\n\nJust as we found out the Marmite character was actually one of the good guys, he has to die. This was definitely one of the most depressing deaths in the series.\n\nNymphadora Tonks\n\nShe was cool - she could change her hair colour at will and liked to be called Tonks, because she hated her first name.\n\nHer and Lupin were such a great couple - which is why it was tragic they both had to die. She was killed by her own aunt - Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nFred Weasley\n\nThis was arguably the most depressing death at the Battle. He left behind his twin, George, after being killed in an explosion outside the Room of Requirement.\u00a0\n\nHe used his last words to mock his swotty elder brother Percy Weasley, in typical Fred fashion.\n\nPeople have been remembering the battle online\n\nHow on Earth has it been 18 years since the Battle of Hogwarts?\n\nIt might seem odd to someone unfamiliar with the timings of Harry Potter to think it has been 18 years since the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nAfter all, the novel 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows', which contains the Battle of Hogwarts, was published in 2007.\n\nBecause JK Rowling didn't write a book a year, the timeline is a few years behind real life.\n\nBelow is a timeline of the events, year-by-year, in Harry Potter's world.",

        "text":"British playwright Harold Pinter, whose subtext-rich writing style is an adjective in the Oxford English dictionary, won the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature in Stockholm on Thursday.\n\nThe 75-year-old London playwright, son of a Jewish tailor, is best known for such ground-breaking plays as \"The Caretaker,\" \"The Room,\" \"The Birthday Party,\" and \"The Dumb Waiter.\" Pinter is also a screenwriter, poet, director, actor, human rights advocate and recently, fierce opponent to the war in Iraq.\n\nThe Swedish Academy said in its citation that Pinter \"uncovers the precipice under everyday prattle and forces entry into oppression's closed rooms.\"\n\n\"Pinter restored theater to its basic elements: an enclosed space and unpredictable dialogue, where people are at the mercy of each other and pretence crumbles,\" said the citation for the $1.28 million prize.\n\n\"I feel quite overwhelmed,\" Pinter said outside his London home Thursday, according to news agency reports. \"I had absolutely no idea.\"\n\nPinter said he was \"speechless,\" the Associated Press reported, and then added: \"I have to stop being speechless when I get to Stockholm.\"\n\nPinter's spare, dark writing style, where much is going on underneath a surface of pregnant silences, has been dubbed \"Pinteresque\" and is an adjective found in the dictionary.\n\nPinter's plays revolve around the daily give-and-take of marriage, friendship and family life in Britain. He's known as a master of subtext, where most of the emotional drama is going on beneath the veneer of normal life. The characters are often enclosed in just one room and live their lives like a dark game with their actions often contradicting what they say.\n\n\"In a typical Pinter play, we meet people defending themselves against intrusion or their own impulses by entrenching themselves in a reduced and controlled existence,\" the academy said.\n\nAcademy Permanent Secretary Horace Engdahl said Pinter, once a heavy smoker who underwent chemotherapy for esophageal cancer in 2002, was overwhelmed that he had won the prize.\n\n\"He did not say many words, in fact he was very happy,\" Engdahl said. He called Pinter the \"towering figure\" in English drama over the second half of the 20th century.\n\nPinter has looked frail and thin at recent public appearances, supporting himself with a cane. He has been quoted as saying he feels \"exhausted\" and \"at the end of my tether.\"\n\nHis health has not stopped him from engaging in fierce political debate, however, most recently about the war in Iraq, which he has called a \"bandit act, an act of blatant state terrorism.\"\n\nPinter, born in East London in October 1930, is the first Briton to win the literature award since V.S. Naipaul won it in 2001.\n\nThe playwright has said that his encounters with anti-Semitism in his youth affected him deeply as did the wartime bombing of London, the academy said. Pinter won the award on Yom Kippur, the most important day of the year in the Jewish calendar.\n\nPinter honed his literary skills during his twenties as an actor in repertory theater companies in Britain and Ireland. Critics savaged his first full-length play in London, \"The Birthday Party\" in 1958, but by the opening of his 1960 ground-breaking play, \"The Caretaker,\" Pinter was hailed as a fresh new talent and the awards started flowing in.\n\nHe solidified his reputation with plays such as \"The Homecoming\", which won the Tony Award for Best Play when it was produced in the United States in 1967 and the acclaimed \"Betrayal,\" in 1978.\n\nPinter began screenwriting in the early 1960s and wrote the critically acclaimed film adaptation of John Fowles' \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" in 1981 and such other films as \"The Go-Between,\" \"The Servant\" and \"The Accident.\"\n\nHis romantic life became the subject of scandal in 1980 when his actress wife Vivien Merchant, star of many Pinter plays and mother to his son Daniel, divorced him after he had an affair with Lady Antonia Fraser, a renowned British author. Pinter married Fraser later that year and Merchant, an alcoholic, died in 1982, reportedly never getting over the break-up.\n\nPinter has also often directed for the stage and as an actor, has made periodic appearances on stage and in films he has scripted.\n\nMost prolific between 1957 and 1965, Pinter has written 29 plays and directed 27 theater productions and received honorary degrees from 14 universities.\n\nHe told the BBC in an interview in February that he was taking a break from writing plays but that he would continue to write poems.\n\n\"My energies are going in different directions, certainly into poetry,\" Pinter said in the BBC interview six months ago.",

The longlist comprises 18 titles and was selected by an academy of crime writing authors, agents, editors, reviewers, members of the Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival Programming Committee and representatives from T&R Theakston Ltd and\u00a0WHSmith.\n\nThe shortlist of six titles will be announced on 31st May.

It\u2019s a showcase of some of the best authors in the world, and shows that the genre is the most influential when it comes to shaping publishing and popular culture. It\u2019s incredibly exciting to see such strong new voices on the list, and it will no doubt be a hotly-contended\u00a0award.\u201d\n\nGemma Rowland, Literature Festivals Manager at Harrogate International Festivals, said: \u201cThe list demonstrates that even the giants of the genre are constantly kept on their toes, with debut voices as serious contenders. Last year\u2019s winner was a debut from Sarah Hilary.
