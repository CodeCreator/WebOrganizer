(1564, 1616)\u00a0 more...\n\nGenerally speaking, copy editors check written material for errors and awkward writing. A freelance copy editor is a person who is self-employed in this field. He or she often works out of a home office editing copy for various clients but might sometimes work on-site at client locations, depending on the wishes of individual clients. Freelance copy editors work for magazines, newspapers, book publishers and websites. They also edit marketing pieces, advertising copy and a variety of other written material for ad agencies, corporate creative departments, educational institutions and other organizations.\n\nThe freelance copy editor, who might be the last person to look at a written piece before it goes to print or is published online, performs many of the same duties as a staff copy editor. The freelance copy editor reviews written copy for things such as correct grammar, spelling and word usage. He or she tightens up verbose writing and smooths out transitions to make copy flow better. Sometimes, significant rewriting of a piece can be the responsibility of the copy editor, but the job generally is one of correcting and smoothing rather than redoing. Freelance copy editors also write headlines and photo captions and are sometimes called on to verify facts, especially for publications that don't employ fact checkers.\n\n\nMagazines, book publishers, ad agencies and other organizations often use specific editorial style guides in creating their written materials. Two style guides that are commonly used are The Associated Press Stylebook and The Chicago Manual of Style. Client organizations sometimes develop their own style guides. An important aspect of a copy editor's job is to ensure that the correct style is used. Freelance copy editors, because they might have a variety of clients using various editorial styles, often must be well-versed in the standard styles and be fast learners to quickly come up to speed on client-specific styles.\n\nAs self-employed workers, freelance copy editors can go through extremely busy periods followed by dry spells, so they often must spend a significant amount of time marketing themselves and their work. To find new clients, freelance copy editors often network, attend events for client industries, join organizations for freelance writers and editors and advertise their services through websites, brochures and other means. A freelance copy editor might have a four-year journalism degree, an English degree or another language-related degree. Many freelance copy editors start their careers as staff editors, gaining experience and contacts, before taking the plunge into self-employment.\n\n\nYou might also Like\n\n\nDiscuss this Article\n\nPost 3\n\n@candyquilt-- Yea, proofreaders don't check facts either. They don't have much say in the content, they just make sure that everything is written correctly. But a copy editor may also be responsible for making sure that the content is accurate and that the information is from a reliable source. They are much more than proofreaders and as far as I know, the qualifications and pay rate for copy editors are higher.\n\nPost 2\n\n@SteamLouis-- They can be very similar, especially if a proofreader is also working on content that is published. But for the most part, a copy editor has more responsibilities. He or she may not just read and proofread content, but may also be responsible for making sure that everything looks good. This may mean editing or adjusting images, etc.\n\nA proofreader usually just deals with writing and makes sure that the grammar and spelling correct. Not all proofreaders work on published materials, although many do.\n\nPost 1\n\nWhat is the difference between a freelance proofreader and a freelance copy editor?

They receive a relatively high salary regardless of the country they work in.\u00a0The pediatrician salary in South Africa is R366,251 ($28,243 USD) per year; while in the United States the same professionals make a salary of $144,215 yearly.\n\nIn the UK, the pay stands at \u00a344,450 ($57,585), while in Canada the pediatrician pay goes up to C$125,000 ($98,991 USD).

The information reported in this article was gathered from,\u00a0here are varying numbers of individuals reporting their income for each country. Since a specific salary for pediatricians in New Zealand is not given, the information we got is from a very comprehensive report\u00a0from Head Medical that shows what the salary for general practitioners is and the average pediatrician salary per hour.\n\n1.

Experience\n\nPediatricians in all countries have to go through many years of schooling just to be able to practice medicine. Because of this, they have a certain level of expertise that demands high pay even when they are new professionals. In South Africa, experienced pediatricians will make 35% more than entry-level. While in the United States the growth is 16% from entry-level to experienced professionals.\n\nA consideration to take when looking at experience is the years of schooling where the pediatrician is not receiving a full-salary but is gaining experience. Seems that pediatricians lose out on about $500,000 dollars of income when they are in school. Their relatively high starting salary compensates for some of this lost income.\n\n3. Industry\n\nPediatricians in Australia typically work in specialized pediatric hospitals, but some of these professionals will work in a general hospital that sees pediatric and geriatric patients. But in New Zealand, most of the hospitals see the general population with complex pediatric cases being referred to a pediatric intensive care unit. Pediatricians in New Zealand and Australia often specialize, but not always.\n\nThe healthcare system in New Zealand is in the public sector. There are 20 health boards that physicians can work for. If a pediatrician has their license in the United Kingdom they are able to transfer it to New Zealand.\n\nPediatricians in the United States will typically work in physician offices or in hospitals. Those who specialize in pediatrics will receive a higher salary than those who do not specialize. Cities that have good pay for pediatricians are San Francisco, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Atlanta, and Houston. While those with pay below the median are New York City, Chicago, and Denver.\n\nSchedule & Working Hours\n\nThe pediatrician working schedule changes based on if they work in a physician office or in a hospital. Frequently, a pediatrician who makes rounds in the hospital also works in a physician office. This pediatrician will start working at around 7 AM to make rounds in the hospital and then see patients in the physician office. The pediatrician will average 4-6 patients an hour and has limited free time during the day. Therefore, they end work between 5 and 7 PM and work four days a week in the United States.\n\nBonuses & Benefits\n\nPediatricians in Canada will receive different benefits depending on the province they work in. For example, those in Newfoundland will get up to one year of maternity or paternity leave, life insurance, and a meal allowance. On the other hand, those in Ontario will get 35-37 weeks of parental leave, supplemental unemployment, dental insurance, but no food allowance. Physicians in Canada do not receive benefits for the most part.\n\nPediatricians in New Zealand are eligible for different benefits depending on their citizen status, you can receive more benefits if you are a New Zealand citizen, a permanent resident, an Australian citizen, or a Visa holder. Therefore, New Zealand residents are eligible for health care benefits while those from Australia need to live or plan to live in New Zealand for more than two years to be eligible for benefits.\n\nThe table below shows the health care benefits that pediatricians receive. This information is complicated and often changes at the local level within a country as mentioned in the previous paragraphs.\n\nCountry United States Canada United Kingdom Australia New Zealand India South Africa\nMedical 78 0* 25\nDental 50 0*\nVision 39 0* 33\n\nCareer Outlook\n\nThere is a shortage of pediatricians who work in general offices and in specialties. One of the reasons for this is the high cost of education and training. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics is looking into revising their training and funding of new pediatric specialists to make the high amount of education worthwhile.\n\nThe job growth for pediatricians in the United States is 10% through the year 2024. One factor that may mitigate this growth is the number of physician assistants or nurse practitioners who will be hired to see patients. These positions work under the direction of a physician but can eliminate the need for multiple pediatricians. There were 34,800 pediatricians in the United States in 2014, and it is predicted there will be 38,400 by 2024.\n\n\nConsequently, a pediatrician career means spending your days working to make children healthy. This can be a rewarding position, but to get to this level a high degree of dedication and sacrifice are required to complete the necessary schooling. Pediatricians have a good salary, but they also have a high cost of working in terms of worrying about insurance and other expenses.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
