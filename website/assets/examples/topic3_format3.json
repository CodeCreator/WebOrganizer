        "text":"Service Member - Rental Scams | Attorney General - State of Colorado\n\nService Member - Rental Scams\n\nRental Agreement\n\nScammers often take advantage of the transient nature of the military and the constant relocation many soldiers and their families endure on a regular basis, particularly targeting personnel seeking off-base housing.\n\nIt begins when a scammer advertises a property for rent at a great price through free internet sites such as Craigslist and other similar web sites. The advertisements appear to be legitimate, often containing what appears to be property details along with a variety of photos to entice victims.\u00a0\n\nOnce the soldier shows interest in the property, the scammer pressures that soldier to send a deposit immediately. After the money is sent, the soldier never hears from the scammer again as the property doesn\u2019t exist or isn\u2019t really for rent.\n\nWhat to do:\n\n  \u2022 Avoid any listing that requires you to act immediately or pressures you to act urgently.\n  \u2022 Be wary of sending deposit money via wire transfer or other money transmittal services, such as Western Union or MoneyGram.\n  \u2022 Never provide your personal identifying information to an unknown individual or entity, especially to those contacts which are made solely through email.\n  \u2022 Be wary of poorly written correspondence or advertisements that contain misspellings, improper use of language, or unusual formatting.\n  \u2022 Always use a reputable property management company or agency to locate legitimate housing by checking out the company with an agency such as the Better Business Bureau.\n\nIf you believe you have been victimized by a rental scam or wish to report suspicious activity, please file a report here\n\n\n\nOther Links\n\nInsurance Fraud\n\nDo you suspect insurance fraud?\u00a0 If so, learn more in the Insurance Fraud Center\n\nWant to Learn More?\n\nVisit the Fraud Center for additional information on ways to protect yourself.\n\nVictim of Fraud?\n\nReport fraud or suspicious activity.\n\nSign Up For Fraud Alerts\n\nRegister here for the Consumer Fraud Bulletin to receive fraud alerts and tips to keep you safe.",

        "text":"Select Page\n\nFees - Notarizing Documents\n\nand Obtaining Copies of Documents\n\nNotarizing a document means that a certificate is attached to a photocopy of an original document with a notary seal stating that the copy is a true copy of the original document. Some institutions require notarized copies as opposed to photocopies because in some situations a photocopy is not sufficient but they do not want to request the original.\n\n*Please Note: I only notarize documents for current or previous clients. Clients must call my office and make an appointment in order to have documents notarized. Elise Hallewick of our office notarizes documents and has her own fees schedule.\n\nWhen an Affidavit, Deed or Statutory Declaration has to be sworn for use outside of Ontario, a Notary is required to take the Affidavit rather than just a Commissioner of Oaths. In a circumstance such as this, I might charge a fee to my clients if it takes time to complete the form, which often out of province forms do require.\n\n\nService 1 Copy Only 4 Extra Copies (after 1st copy) Any copy after 5th\nNotarizing a document for a client on a current file $25.00 $25.00 $10.00\nNotarizing a document for a client when the file is closed $40.00 $25.00 $10.00\n\nWhile a client\u2019s file is open, it is my policy to ensure that my clients receive copies of all the correspondence exchanged, reports from specialists, and related documents.\n\nHowever, once a file is closed it often happens that down the road a client may have misplaced their copy, and will call to request a copy from our office. It used to be my policy to store the client\u2019s physical file in storage, however since 2010 we scan the file electronically and then throw the file out except for original wills and powers of attorney until we return those original documents to the client. \u00a0We also have or in the process of throwing out all files after fifteen years (without scanning anything but marriage contracts).\n\nShould you require a copy of a document from a file that was closed if we are still holding onto the file in hard copy or in the database there is a $50 fee retrieving the file from storage or our database. However, since 2010 we have only been keeping digital copies of agreements.\n\nIf it is a court document, though we may have a copy of the document in storage, often an original of the document is needed, and therefore obtaining the document from the court house is the best route to take. It is also cheaper to attend the court house and request a certified copy of the document directly rather than have me pull the file. If the file is more than a year old, the court will have sent the file to their storage facility, and though they do not charge a fee to pull the file from storage, it may take a few extra weeks until the file arrives at the court house. The court charges a fee for certified copies of court documents, usually about $19 depending on the document and photocopying costs for other documents in the file.\n\nFind Us\n\nMirsky, Pascoe\nSuite 300\nThe Bell Mews\n2039 Robertson Road\nOttawa, ON K2H 8R2\n\n\n\n\nAccepted Payment",
