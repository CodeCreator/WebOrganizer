That means the government can't access records for someone who called someone who called someone who called the suspect.\n\n\nNo longer will national security letters be kept secret indefinitely.\n\n\nRevelations that the U.S. monitored the communications of friendly heads of state have sparked outrage overseas. Going forward, the U.S. won't monitor the communications of \"our close friends and allies overseas\" unless there's a compelling national security purpose.\n\n\nObama is issuing a presidential directive that outlines what the government uses intelligence for, and what purposes are prohibited.\n\n\nObama called for a panel of outside advocates that can represent privacy and civil liberty concerns before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Those advocates would be present in for cases where the court is considering issues that are novel or significant \u2014 for instance, cases that raise a new issue the court hasn't dealt with previously.\n\n\nObama is directing the State Department to appoint a senior officer to coordinate diplomatic issues regarding technology and data-collection.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama is ordering changes to the government's collection of phone records that he says will end the program \"as it currently exists.\"\n\nObama said in a speech at the Justice Department on Wednesday that intelligence officials have not intentionally abused the program to invade privacy.\n\nBut, he also said, he thinks critics of the program have been right to argue that without proper safeguards, the collection could be used to obtain more information about American's private lives and open the door to more intrusive programs.\n\nObama announced the changes after a months-long review spurred by former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden's leaks about secret surveillance programs.\n\nRead tomorrow's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.\n\n\nComments on: Obama backs limits on NSA phone collections\n\nTo report abuse or misuse of this area please hit the \"Suggest Removal\" link in the comment to alert our online managers.

Privacy\u2014of what? It\u2019s largely a modern myth. It\u2019s been going out for decades. Do we want technology, or don\u2019t we? Do we want to be blown up by serial killers, or don\u2019t we?

Reyes initially stopped in the middle of the street but sped off as officers approached his car on foot. 23 seconds later, he made a sharp left turn on 97th Street, lost control, jumped the curb, and pinned Ariel and Gutierrez to the side of the building, police said.\n\nThe NYPD is investigating the pursuit, he added.\n\nReyes \u2014 a junior at the St. Agnes Boys High School on the Upper West Side \u2014 told police he panicked during a routine traffic stop en route to his last day of classes because he was driving\u00a0 with only a learner's permit and was supposed to have an adult in the vehicle.\u00a0\n\nThe SUV was a gift from Reyes' mother, law enforcement sources said.\n\nAriel was declared dead at the hospital and Gutierrez was in stable condition at St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt Hospital Wednesday afternoon.\n\nReyes was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital for breathing problems and was arraigned late Wednesday on charges of second degree manslaughter and unlawfully fleeing a police officer, according to the criminal complaint.\u00a0\n\nA witness said his car appeared to be driving between 50 to 60 miles per hour before turning left onto West 97th Street before the crash, the complaint stated.\u00a0\n\n\"For some reason or other they put those lights on and they scared the wits out of him and he took off \u2014 when that happens and you\u2019ve never had that experience he just followed an impulse,\" said Schmukler Thursday.\u00a0\n\nSchmukler said he did not know where Reyes was being held and that bail had not been set and his client had not entered a plea.\u00a0\n\nWhen bail was set, Schmukler said he expected there to be \"plenty of support,\" for Reyes.\n\n\"This poor kid will have to live for the rest of his life knowing that innocent people died withhis actions.\u00a0It\u2019s a tragedy all the way around,\" said Schmukler.\n\nLaw enforcement sources said Reyes likely would have only gotten a reprimand from the cops who\u00a0stopped him, or they might have made him called his mother to come get the car.\u00a0\n\n\"I guess he did not want to tell his mother,\" the source added. \"Now he has a whole lot more trouble and a child's dead.\"\n\nAt Tuesday's press conference, Kelly described young people driving without licenses as an age-old problem.\n\n\u201cYoung people driving with just learners' permits is not a new problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't know of any new solutions to come up with.''\n\nAriel and her grandmother were one block away from the Holy Name School, where she was enrolled in a Pre-k program.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, students from the school filed into the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus for a 9:30 a.m. memorial service in her honor, struggling to understand her loss.\n\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d said Diana Rivera, 40, a volunteer at the school. \u201cThe little ones don\u2019t know what happened but they know someone is missing. They ask questions like \u2018where is she?\u2019 and \u2018when is she coming back?\u2019 All we can say is she is with the angels.\u201d\n\nStudents in uniform and grieving adults filled the seats of the church. The school choir, dressed in golden robes, sang a few songs for Ariel.\n\nAida Fonseca, a teacher\u2019s aid at Holy Name, remembered Ariel as a cheerful girl who had many friends. The little girl was an energetic student who enjoyed to dance, paint and read, she said.\n\n\u201cShe was always smiling and carried her little doll everywhere she went,\u201d Fonseca said.\n\nAriel\u2019s family did not attend the service.\n\n\u201cThey are devastated,\u201d Ariel\u2019s grandfather, Paolo Russo, 71, said of the family Tuesday. \u201cThis was a tragedy, and we are all very sad. We\u2019re mourning her loss.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Aidan Gardiner, Trevor Kapp and Emily Frost.",

An earlier version of this article located the school in the wrong part of town.\n\nCOLUMBIA \u2014 The Columbia School Board is expected to further discuss on Monday the temporary boundary change proposed to relieve overcrowding at Mill Creek Elementary School.\n\n\nDocuments for Monday's meeting can be accessed on\u00a0the Columbia Public Schools website.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAssistant Superintendent Peter Stiepleman is scheduled to show the board the presentation he gave Oct. 29 to the Mill Creek community about the proposed change and to share community feedback from that meeting.\n\nThe proposed boundary change, which would affect neighborhoods off of Scott and Forum boulevards for the 2014-15 school year, is intended to reduce Mill Creek's enrollment by 100 to 120 students and relieve overcrowding until a new elementary school on the southwest side of Columbia opens in 2016.The affected students would go to Russell Boulevard Elementary School or Paxton Keeley Elementary school.\n\nIt is also hoped that the proposed boundary changes would remain in effect when the new school opens.\n\nDistrict administrators are confident that they can keep the proposed boundary for Russell Boulevard Elementary School, according to a document prepared for board members.\n\nThe neighborhood moved to Paxton Keeley Elementary School under the proposed change could be made part of the new elementary school, according to the document, but \"district administrators feel those students who were moved can continue to be offered the option to stay at Paxton Keeley or go to the new school.\"\n\n*Northeast elementary school name\n\n*The committee formed to name the new elementary school in northeast\u00a0 Columbia will now also be tasked with naming the new southwest elementary school and the new early childhood care center, district spokeswoman Michelle Baumstark said.\n\n\"The board redirected the naming committee (Thursday) now that we have land for the southwest school and the early childhood care center will be on John B. Lange Middle School's property,\" Baumstark said.\n\nThe committee was approved at the board's Oct. 14 meeting and has met three times since then.\n\nBaumstark said that the committee will not make a formal presentation at Monday's meeting.\n\nNominations for school names will reopen Monday and continue to be accepted through Nov. 22.\n\nBond updates\n\nThe board is expected to discuss the April 2014 $50 million bond issue proposal. The bond issue would create a 4- or 5-cent tax increase to help pay down the debt service, Baumstark said.\n\nThe district plans to ask the community to approve four bond issues between 2014 and 2020. Each complies with the district's 10-year facility bond plan to meet enrollment growth needs and fund building projects.\n\nSome funds from the April 2014 bond issue would go toward opening a new elementary school in eastern Columbia, according to previous Missourian reporting.\n\nThe board will also be asked Monday to vote on an offer for the February 2014 sale of $50 million in general obligation bonds from April 2010 and April 2012 voter authorizations. The sale's proceeds would be used to construct a new elementary school, to make improvements and expansions at various locations around the district and to fund technology improvements, according to a document prepared for the meeting.\n\nThe board meeting is open to the public and will take place at 6:30 p.m. Monday in the Neil C. Aslin District Administration Building, 1818 W Worley St.\n\nLike what you see here? Become a member.\n\nShow Me the Errors (What's this?)\n\nReport corrections or additions here.
