Now in his fifth, Stern has offered a novella and seven stories dealing with his major themes: the life of the senses, the life of art\u2014with special emphasis on the art of music\u2014and the comic and lyric results when the two lives cross paths. From contemporary Paris to the New York of the fifties, from the way the mind works to the way the heart sinks or sings, these stories wend their magical way.\n\nDANIEL STERN is the author of nine novels and five short story collections. His first collection, Twice Told Tales, won the Rosenthal Award for literary excellence given by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is currently the Cullen Distinguished Professor of English in the creative writing program at the University of Houston.\n\nWhat Readers Are Saying:\n\n\"Stories by a man who has told many, and the telling of those others has shaped these new ones. He wants, now, to articulate contradictions, not resolve them. No resolutions here, only the wisdom of hindsight and the comedy of loss. 'Afterwards,' Stern says, 'that unavoidable word when telling about sex afterwards I lay listening. . . .' These stories are what is heard\u2014overheard.\" --Richard Howard\n\n\nProse Sketches and Poems\nJoshua Beene and God\nNightcharmer and Other Tales of Claude Seignolle\nReview Copy Request Form Desk Copy Request Form",
