The light amber gemstones and many Swarovski crystals were individually placed and sewn by Mr. Agostino and his staff.\u201d\n\nThe Jewel Ball was a benefit for The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and the Kansas City Sympohony.\nPhotos\/ Mary S. Watkins\n\n\nMain Line Times Article Profiles AGOSTINO\n\nCaroline O\u2019Halloran\nFlair Editor\nFashion and Lifestyle\nMain Line Times \/\n\nOn the second floor of a Lancaster Avenue storefront, design assistant Rebecca Haun hand embroiders delicate flowers on the top of a silk chiffon gown. A few yards away a seasoned seamstress labors over the matching skirt. When they\u2019re finished, the two will have spent upwards of 200 hours on the project: a custom-designed mother-of-the-groom ensemble.\n\nThis is fashion in the slow lane at Agostino in Bryn Mawr, home to the Main Line\u2019s only real couturier.\n\nIn this fast-fashion, outsourced era, Frank Agostino is a throwback to a more intimate, almost genteel time. He and his nimble-fingered seamstresses have been creating one-of-a-kind clothing for some of the area\u2019s most affluent, discriminating women for decades.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t come to me with a picture of a dress and tell me to make it,\u201d says the affable designer who\u2019s been known to turn down work if he doesn\u2019t feel a \u201cconnection\u201d with a client or if the client wants a copycat design. \u201cThat\u2019s what dressmakers are for. That\u2019s not what I am.\u201d\n\nA woman who dons an Agostino gets an unspoken guarantee: no one else at the society wedding, charity gala or debutante ball will be wearing what she\u2019s wearing.\n\nAficionados gladly wait up to five months and pay anywhere from a few thousand to upwards of $10,000 for his handiwork.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well worth the money,\u201d insists Andrea Morrissey, a Newtown Square client with closet full of custom Agostino sportswear and evening clothes. \u201cIf you want something different and original in beautiful fabrics, he\u2019s the one. I tell Frank what I like and we design it together.\u201d\n\nMorrissey once shopped at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and boutiques of similar ilk but switched to Agostino for the personal service and custom fit. \u201cI\u2019ve become harder to fit as I\u2019ve gotten older. With Frank, you don\u2019t have to spend extra for alterations, so I end up paying about the same as I did at the high-end stores.\u201d\n\nAnother plus is longevity, she says. \u201cEverything is so gorgeous, you can wear it for years, like a Chanel suit.\u201d\n\nAgostino says he\u2019s seen clients wear his designs for 30 years. \u201cI often joke with them that after three wearings, the stitches are going to break.\u201d\n\nThe Agostino aesthetic is simple: make women feel good about themselves \u2013 even women with less-than-perfect bodies. \u201cMy goal has always been to enhance a woman in beautiful, timeless clothes that are comfortable and practical. Everything we make is lined in silk so it feels good. And I spend a lot of time with my fit model to make sure the garments work for them, that they can reach a pocket or a zipper. If she can\u2019t go to the bathroom in it, we make adjustments. Men would never wear something that\u2019s uncomfortable. Why should women?\u201d\n\nValerie Bonner, a Radnor aesthetician who moonlights as an Agostino fit and show model, hired the designer to make her wedding dress six years ago.\n\n\u201cI knew it would be elegant, sleek and sophisticated,\u201d recalls Bonner. \u201cFrank knows what women want and what will make them look beautiful. And unlike other couture designers who stop at size 10, he sews for women of every shape and size.\u201d\n\nMany in his stable of loyal clients, including Morrissey and Bonner, have become personal friends, a by-product of the intimacy of the custom-design process and Agostino\u2019s easygoing charm.\n\nLongtime client Mary Ann Oaks sought an Agostino original when she learned she had ordered the exact same Carolina Herrera gown to wear to her daughter\u2019s wedding as the mother of the groom. Since then he\u2019s dressed the prominent Gladwyne woman for every major life event. \u201cFrank takes a personal interest in what you\u2019re doing and where you\u2019re going,\u201d says Oaks. \u201cHe makes sure what you\u2019re wearing is appropriate to the occasion. You end up becoming good friends because he\u2019s such fun. \u201d\n\nWhile so many designers rely on their design teams, Agostino is hands on.\n\nHe sketches every design, he handpicks every fabric, and he even knows how to sew \u2013 a skill he learned as a boy from his Aunt Rosie, a former Italian couture seamstress who lived across the street from his family in Brooklyn. \u201cI would watch what she was doing \u2013 all the old couture techniques \u2013 and I just loved it.\u201d\n\nBut he was slow to embrace fashion as a career. \u201cBeing a boy in Brooklyn growing up on the streets and playing stickball, you don\u2019t make dresses. So it took me a while to get into it.\u201d\n\nAn early love was theatre. He sang, danced, choreographed off-Broadway shows then settled into costume design. His first official job in fashion was a stint as a dress buyer for Macy\u2019s in Kansas City. In 1974, a similar job at Gimbels brought him to Philadelphia. He and his wife, Grace Ann, bought a home on Forrest Road in Merion and never left.\n\nAgostino made the switch from retail to design when he was hired to run the dress division at Gloria Vanderbilt, where he says he built the business from \u201cnothing to 12 million in seven months.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when he decided to strike out on his own. \u201cI figured I had been in retail, I had been in manufacturing, I ran a design room, I designed a line \u2026 I figured if I did it for someone else, I could do it for myself.\u201d\n\nIn the early \u201980s, he started a design business in his home, then opened a small studio in Narberth.\n\nBy 1994, he had outgrown the space and moved to Rittenhouse Place in Ardmore where he had a retail shop, a modern art gallery \u2013 art is another passion \u2013 and workroom.\n\nHis last move \u2013 to Bryn Mawr in 2000 \u2013 will be his last, he says.\n\nThe first floor houses an elegant retail salon for his ready-to-wear and couture lines; the second floor is his workroom\/design studio that employs five seamstresses and two assistants.\n\nAgostino celebrated his 70th birthday last weekend but shows no interest in slowing down. Indeed his wife, Grace Ann, says the \u201cpossibility of his retiring is probably zero.\u201d\n\nHe still shows new fall and spring collections each year in New York, still charms the ladies at charity events and trunk shows, and still advises area fashion students. (A career highlight came in late 2010 when Moore College of Art & Design mounted a special exhibit of 35 of his original designs.)\n\nAsk Agostino to explain his staying power in the fickle world of fashion and he answers simply. \u201cI do something that no one really does. I listen to the customer and make her what she wants: beautiful clothes that last.\u201d\n\nPhotos taken by Caroline O\u2019Halloran in the Clubhouse and Model Home at Athertyn, a condominium community at The Haverford Reserve\n\n\nFrank Agostino opened The Angels of Hope Foundation annual \u201cCelebration of Women\u201d as Master of Ceremonies and introduced Lynn White, Founder and President.

At night, when the store\u2019s spotlight shines on it, he said, the tree looks snow-covered.\n\nObservers are surpris... (truncated)",

        "text":"Linie41 Profile\n\nHey friend - just trying to get started and see what's what.\n\nPayment is expected after 3 business days.\n\nShipping - an inexact science.\n\nI am shipping worldwide.\n\nAlso, I am trying to visit the post office at least every two days to dispatch all items ordered and payed.\n\nHowever, actual shipping costs may vary, depending on weight, size of the package, distance, insurance and many other factors. Up to 2.2 lbs (including packing) I am able to ship very cheaply and prospectively fast (by airmail), thanks to DHL. Interestingly, though, sometimes it is even cheaper NOT to combine shipping if you are interested in more than one item (especially the lightweight garments should be dispatched separately if you like to save money). Shipping a parcel up to 11lbs for instance costs 5.5 times as much as shipment for a parcel of just 2.2 lbs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c oddly enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it takes even longer, since it is being delivered by land (or by sea, respectively).\n\nYou see, I really try to keep shipping prices as low as humanly possible for you, but labeling all shipping prices for every region worldwide would just be a hot mess.\n\nAll shipping quotes in the individual listings can be trusted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I will not charge anything in addition to the prices displayed, despite having to pay out of my own personal pocket nearly every time (yes, people, I am THAT nice).\nIf you prefer to have your goods dispatched without insurance, please consider the risk of parcels getting lost or damaged during shipment!\n\nI am shipping from Germany. Based on your location, your items might take some time to be delivered to you, so please be patient. Delays might be further increased due to crossing national borders requiring customs clearance and other compulsory customs services. Please be aware of possibly having to pay custom fees depending on the value of each item you purchased.\n\nThanks to European Customs Union there won't be arising any customs charges within the EU.\n\nAll items on display are being presented in their actual and current condition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I am doing my best to describe all items as accurately as possible. Please read the item descriptions carefully and COMPARE THE MEASUREMENTS of the items to your own body in order to prevent unpleasant non-fitting surprises. DO NOT exclusively rely on size labels!\n\nPlease keep in mind that Vintage means pre-loved and some minor signs of wear should be expected.\n\nThere can be NO returns and NO refunds based on size, fit, deviation in color or due to buyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remorse.\n\nIf there is a problem with your item, please contact me before leaving unflattering feedback \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean to be a sissy but you should take in consideration that I am doing this whole shop as a one-woman-production. There is only one of me and therefore (once in a blue moon) mistakes may happen.\n\nGerman residents may please refer to German General Terms and Conditions (AGB) and regular domestic shipping prices.
