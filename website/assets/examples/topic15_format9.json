        "text":"You are here\n\nWhy Eco-Friendly Packaging Most Used In 2018\n\nIn this modern world where everything is growing so fast, there are also some things, which are getting decreased. One of them is the purity and cleanliness from the environment. This is because of the usage of so many different harmful chemicals and material. Like we use plastic bags and many other harmful materials like that which are not easily recyclable. When these type of material cannot be recycled this can cause so much damage to your environment. Therefore, we should avoid using these type of packages. Instead of using plastic bags, we should have to prefer green packages. There are so many different benefits of using green packaging in this modern era.\n\n  \u2022 Consumer Interest\n\nWhen you are in a selling business it is necessary to know, what your audience wants from you. As when you provide them with what they want they will start buying products from your specific brand. As the growing trends prevail among most of the consumers, so you should not underestimate the power of trending among consumers. In this modern era as the trends are changing and shifting towards eco-friendly packaging companies should also focus on these trends. This makes the consumers attracted towards your brand and also increase the demand of your brand.\n\n  \u2022 Increasing Awareness\n\nAs the world is getting developed day by day so are the awareness among consumers is increasing. In these days internet is providing information about each, everything, and that too in detail. Consumers are getting aware of the matter of fact that the harmful material like plastic is causing damage to the environment. So people are getting more conscious about saving their planet. For this reason, most of the customers demand eco-friendly packages. They know that eco-friendly packages are the one, which can save the environment and can keep the product safe. As in case of food products, eco-friendly packages can serve best. These do not allow any sort of contamination to enter the food product. Therefore, because of the increasing awareness trend of packaging is shifting towards green packages.\n\n  \u2022 Cost-Effective Packages\n\nIn addition to the increasing awareness, these packages are suitable and are demanded in 2018 because of its cost-effective quality. These packages are made by using the material, which is easily available in the market and can be found at home. These are usually made by using cardboard, Kraft or paper, which is most easily available material in the market. These materials are so easy to cut and design according to a specific product. So companies do not need to spend so much money on these packages. Because of their low-cost manufacturing, these are also available to customers at lower rates. The inks and machines used in printing solutions also cost less, which also makes the most cost-effective.\n\n  \u2022 Ensure Quality\n\nThese packages also ensure quality as the material used in manufacturing is of good quality. There is a specialty of eco-friendly packages that the material is available at a low cost but has an excellent quality. These packages can carry all type of products safely without causing any damage. In this era, most of the people prefer\u00a0eco-friendly packaging\u00a0as this is the only packaging solution, which ensures 100% safety of the product. These can keep delicate and sensitive products safe in them. You can also design these packages with an insert so that delicate products can be packaged safely. These will not cause any damage to products if are mishandled by the workers while delivery.\n\n  \u2022 Reusable\n\nIn this modern world, everyone is seeking for saving money and getting profit from their business. These packages are preferred in this era as these are reusable packages. One can efficiently use them again and again for different purposes. So you do not need to spend more money buying a new box. Re-usability of packages make it more suitable and preferred by most of the customers. As everyone finds for profit and excellent outlooks.\n\n  \u2022 Build Strong Relation Among Company and Customer\n\nWhen companies use eco-friendly packages for selling their products, it helps the company in building strong and trust relationship with customers. As when a consumer gets to know about the fact that this company is striving for the betterment of customer, he or she will automatically start trusting on it. In this way, that packaging can help you out. As when sometimes finds other as responsible for what they are providing there develops a feeling of belongingness and trust. Therefore, in this relationship both of the parties benefit each other. The company provides healthy packaging solution whereas customer gives profit.\n\n  \u2022 Most Creative Packaging\n\nAs we, all know that these are easy to cut into different designs and shapes. So it becomes more comfortable enough to create an amazing and innovative package. By using this material, you can make the most creative and innovative packages that no one can beat up in the market. These packages give more astonishing looks to your products and make people unintentionally attracted to them. Companies can design the most exciting and inspiring designs for these packages. As these are, also reusable so companies can make them look more creative by reducing them to package any other product. These are more trendy because of their creative and innovative looks, which enhances their shelf value.",

        "text":"\n\nInnovative Thinking\n\nAutomation Solutions: 3 Ways to Defeat Choice Paralysis\n\n\n\n\u201cLearning to choose is hard. Learning to choose well is harder. And learning to choose well in a world of unlimited possibilities is harder still, perhaps too hard.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Barry Schwartz, The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less\n\nIn today\u2019s industries, manufacturers have an entire constellation of technology solutions to consider. Factories can be digitized from beginning to end, integrated into\u00a0automation systems, connected to the cloud, measured by big data, mobilized and networked into the Internet of Things.\n\nWith so much technology available, many manufacturers are paralyzed by the paradox of choice: the more industrial solutions appear, the harder it is\u00a0to know what will work and what just isn\u2019t right for your business.\n\nHow can you emerge from the swamp of indecision and implement the automation solutions that will boost your business?\n\n\n1. Make Room for Reconnaissance\n\nFeeling paralyzed often comes from the pressure to deliver. That pressure can change the quest for improvement into an obsession with research. There\u2019s always more to learn, so there\u2019s never a clear decision-point.\n\nRather than fight the urge to gather more information, make reconnaissance part of your routine.\n\nPut aside time for simply exploring options without the mindset that you\u2019re shopping for automation solutions. Treat it like a learning experience only. This reduces the pressure to assign value to every possible venture and expands your general knowledge about your industry. Spending just 20 minutes on reconnaissance every day builds expertise and puts your options in perspective when you do reach a decision-point.\n\n\n2. Accept\u00a0Margins for Error\n\nIt\u2019s natural to feel conflicted about new automation solutions technology. It may seem like there are no margins for error \u2013 make one wrong move, and you might as well shut down the factory today. Opportunity cost matters.\n\nNow take a deep breath. There are many paths to success, and it\u2019s better to take a step, any step, than to stand still and watch the competition pass you by.\n\nNew forms of automation tech, like reprogramming existing\u00a0systems\u00a0and data collection, can offer efficiency advantages without monopolizing your time or resources. Successful changes like these can build your confidence in bigger improvements down the line.\n\nJust remember: there are no perfect solutions.\n\nYou can still find your way to the best fit for your company. Just don't think of your first project choice as pass\/fail, do or die, irreversibly\u00a0final.\u00a0\u00a0Successful manufacturers aren\u2019t flawless \u2013 they\u2019re resilient.\n\n3. DIY or Delegate?\n\nYes, you can do it all in-house. Your engineers are smart and capable; they can rig a data collection system. A dedicated team could even link it to mobile applications or migrate production information to the cloud.\n\nBut is that the best use of your engineers\u2019 time and expertise?\n\nAnything created in-house will continue to draw from your team\u2019s time and skills for maintenance, upgrades, and new training. In my cases, automation technology constitutes a full-time job by itself. When you\u2019re trying to decide what automation solutions are right for your business, you may also end up deciding how to stretch your people thin.\n\nThat\u2019s assuming your in-house team has the requisite experience to design and implement broad industrial solutions. If they don\u2019t, you\u2019re left wondering what options are even feasible.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to delegate.\n\nWait for a lightning bolt of clarity and you may wait forever. Instead, when you're\u00a0unsure of the solution or the steps needed to achieve it, phone a friend.\u00a0Choosing a partner you trust to evaluate your existing systems and machinery\u00a0side-steps\u00a0choice paralysis\u00a0altogether. Automation solutions experts are\u00a0engineers devoted full-time to understanding and applying the right technology for every application. An automation team can offer just a few highly researched solutions\u00a0based in years of expertise, reducing the pressure on you to know everything\u00a0on your own.\n\n\nWhat Now?\n\nIf you're looking for an automation solutions partner to help you choose and implement new technology or upgrade existing resources, Premier Automation's team of over 20 in-house engineers\u00a0will do your homework for you.

        "text":"Home \/ Crops \/ Corn High Yield Team \/ 4 steps for better corn-on-corn\n\n4 steps for better corn-on-corn\n\nGil Gullickson 01\/03\/2013 @ 12:58pm Crops Technology Editor for Successful Farming magazine\/Agriculture.com\n\nRobert Jones and his family have significant hurdles to face in growing continuous corn near Palmyra, Indiana.\n\nPrior to their farming them, some of the Joneses\u2019 fields were continuously cropped to soybeans since farm foreclosures in the 1930s. They are still dealing with the erosion fallout.\n\n\u201cOn some of those farms, we\u2019re dealing with subsoil, not topsoil,\u201d says Robert.\n\nSoil organic matter levels in their fields are on the low side, ranging from 1.9% and 2.9%. Soils with low soil organic matter levels tend to dry out quicker and don\u2019t contain as many natural nutrients as those on the higher end.\n\nStill, they\u2019ve adapted to these challenges through a sound strategy we\u2019ll outline in our February issue. Until then, here are some other steps they follow in growing corn-on-corn.\n\n1. Early-Season Fungicides\n\nHybrid selection is one of the ways they manage disease. Early-season fungicides applied at the V5 stage (five fully exposed leaf collars) are another method. They can also combine fungicide applications with postemergence liquid herbicide and fertilizer applications. Overall, Jones credits the early-season fungicide application with boosting yields an average 7 bushels per acre.\n\nThey do not apply fungicides at tasseling due to the geography of their fields. \u201cIt is difficult to get an airplane to apply fungicide accurately enough on small fields,\u201d he says.\n\n2. Early-Season Pest Control\n\nThe Joneses key emergence and early-season stands by a seed treatment that fends off nematodes and early-season insects and fungal diseases. Jones says one reason populations of corn nematodes-- native to North America -- have grown is due to corn rootworm-resistant traits. That caused Jones to discontinue using Counter, a soil-applied insecticide that controlled both corn rootworm and nematodes.\n\n\u201cWe found some spots that just didn\u2019t grow (corn),\u201d he says. \u201cOur agronomist advised sending soil samples to an independent lab. We finally narrowed it down to corn nematode. We found the nematodes we had to be Lance, one of the most prolific ones.\u201d\n\nThe nematicide-treated seed nixes nematodes. Capture, an in-furrow insecticide also reinforces insecticide-treated seed in combating grubs and black cutworm.\n\n3. Harvest and Storage Adjustments\n\nThe Joneses used to rotate soybeans with corn. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t break the 60-bushel (per acre) yield barrier for soybeans consistently,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s why they shifted to corn-on-corn. The switch came with a perk.\n\n\u201cContinuous corn is easier to manage logistically,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt was hard to manage two combines and two combine crews. \u201cWe\u2019d always wonder, 'Should we switch to corn today?\u2019\u201d Jones says. \u201cThen the soybean crew would be short of help.\u201d\n\nNo longer. The Joneses downsized from two combines to a larger one. They run a class 9 16-row combine equipped with a Drago head.\n\nCancelPost Comment\n\nNeonicotinoid Insecticide Seed Treatments\u2026 By: 10\/22\/2014 @ 8:43am I always enjoy listening to Mike Gray, University of Illinois Extension entomologist.

There are many factors that affect the overall cost and performance of your marking and coding process. Something as simple as ink can have a profound effect on areas of your production operation that aren't always obvious.\n\nLet us take some of the guesswork out of it for you. We've created an infographic that explores the ways your inkjet fluids are part of a larger production process. In it, we outline how downstream impacts can occur when these factors aren't taken into consideration.

        "text":"Safety and Training Myths Debunked\n\nWhen it comes to safety, myths and rumors often cloud what are acceptable practices in the lifting equipment industry. Jeff Stachowiak, national safety training director for Sunbelt Rentals, Fort Mills, S.C., developed the following list of items in order to set the record straight on many common myths.\n\n\nAre there other Safety Myths you\u2019d like debunked? Contact Jeff at or toll free at 866-455-4106 with any further questions.\n\n\nMyth: Training wallet cards are required by OSHA.\n\n\nWallet cards or personal training identification is NOT an OSHA requirement. OSHA will always look to the employer to prove the employer has trained its employees. Wallet cards are a convenient way to determine if someone has attended training without having to ask the employer for written records or proof of training. Many larger general contractors may require wallet card identification for operator training, but that is a jobsite requirement\u2014not an OSHA requirement. Remember though, you can have a wallet full of training cards, but if OSHA determines upon observation that you are doing something wrong, those wallet cards will not do you any good.\n\n\nMyth: Stay 6 feet from the roof\u2019s edge, and you do not need to be fall protected.\n\n\nEven many OSHA people believe this one. Although I\u2019m not sure where this idea came from, I think people confuse the 6-foot vertical fall distance with this myth. OSHA only has seven options for fall protection, and they are guardrails (which may include a parapet wall high enough to satisfy OSHA guardrail height and strength requirements), safety nets, personal fall arrest systems, positioning device systems, warning line systems, controlled access zones, and safety monitoring systems. The last three requires a physical barrier between the worker and the fall hazard. If you are on a roof, you need one of these options to protect you from a fall no matter how far you are from the roof\u2019s edge or fall hazard.\n\n\nMyth: A harness and lanyard are fall protection.\n\nGuardrails are your best fall protection.\n\nTying off or using a harness\/lanyard is \u201chitting the ground protection,\u201d not fall protection. In order for a harness\/lanyard to work, you have to fall. Therefore the harness\/lanyard does not prevent a fall; guardrails prevent falls.\n\n\nMyth: Harness\/lanyards are required on scissor lifts.\n\nPartially true.\n\nWhile OSHA and ANSI A92.6 currently do not require occupants in a scissor lift to wear personal fall protection, some manufacturers of scissor lifts may recommend or require their use (see the scissor lift operating manual). If the manufacturer recommends or requires a harness and lanyard in a scissor lift, then OSHA can enforce its use. If OSHA determines that a harness\/lanyard might have lessened or prevented someone from getting hurt or killed in a scissor lift accident, it also may issue a citation based on the use.\n\n\nMyth: Equipment training (boom and scissor lifts, skid steer loaders, backhoes, excavators, etc.) is not an OSHA requirement.\n\n\nOSHA requires that employees know the hazards that they might be exposed to at work.\n\n\u2022 OSHA Construction Standard \u201c1926.21(b) (2) The employer shall instruct each employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions and the regulations applicable to his work environment to control or eliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or injury.\u201d\n\n\u2022 OSHA Industry Standard \u201c1910.9(b) Training. Standards in this part requiring training on hazards and related matters, such as standards requiring that employees receive training or that the employer train employees, provide training to employees, or institute or implement a training program, impose a separate compliance duty with respect to each employee covered by the requirement. The employer must train each affected employee in the manner required by the standard, and each failure to train an employee may be considered a separate violation.\u201d\n\n\nMyth: Lock Out-Tag Out (LOTO) does not apply to construction equipment.\n\n\nThis one is complicated. While OSHA does not have a LOTO standard in construction (1926), only in the industry (1910) standard, there are references to locking out hydraulic arms\/buckets on construction equipment, and you must follow the manufacturers\u2019 operator and maintenance manuals with regard to all repairs wherever that equipment might be. OSHA can cite based on the General Duty clause, referencing the Operator or Maintenance manual\u2019s instructions.\n\n\nMyth: A 5,000-pound warehouse forklift can pick up 5,000 pounds.\n\nMaybe, but typically not.\n\nAlthough the ID plates states the forklift\u2019s lifting capacity, the stated capacity is often not the same as the ID plate. Both three-section masts and side-shifting take away capacity from the original rating. OSHA and ASME\/ANSI require manufacturers to test and state on the ID plate the maximum capacity at maximum \u00a0or full height. Therefore, the taller the lift height and the more mast sections there are, the less capacity the forklift will lift. The stated capacity on the ID plate is the maximum capacity. PERIOD.\n\n\nMyth: This _______is OSHA-approved or OSHA-certified.\n\n\nOSHA does not approve or certify any product, service, or training. You can attend OSHA Outreach classes that will make you an OSHA Outreach instructor\/trainer. That is as close as OSHA gets to certifying training. Products or training may \u201cmeet\u201d or \u201cexceed\u201d OSHA regulations or requirements, but OSHA does not endorse, test, review, approve, or certify any products. The same goes for ANSI\u2014it does not approve products.\n\n\nMyth: Training employees will make them work safe.\n\n\nTraining is, no doubt, an important part in preventing accidents but only a small part. There are many other elements to a successful safety program that need to happen simultaneously to help reduce accidents. Other important aspects of a successful safety program include leadership supervision to correct unsafe behavior, encouragement of safe behavior, and effective accident and near-miss investigation. Also share results with all employees involved in safety and obtain their input to help develop processes, correct unsafe conditions, and measure your progress.\n\n\nMyth: OSHA recordable rates are the score to measure safety success.\n\n\nOSHA TIR or TTIR can be a measure to use, but it is not the only measure. Lost time rates, lost days, claims management, safety attitudes or culture, audits, observations, and training all play important roles in measuring safety success. Using the OSHA TIR as your only score to measure success or failure is like looking at the final score of a baseball game and saying we won or lost without analyzing any other aspects of the game. You can be \u201clucky\u201d and not have accidents with little or no safety effort.\n\nAbout the Author:\u00a0\njeff stachowiak\n\nJeff Stachowiak\n\nContact Jeff Stachowiak, national safety training director Sunbelt Rentals, at or toll free at 866-455-4106 with any further questions.",

It is a special equipment planned and produced to meet the needs of high-altitude operations. So what is the development direction of aerial work equipment and future shopping malls? 1. With the continuous progress of my country's urbanization level, the number of urban buildings in China has increased sharply, and the height of buildings has also increased. This has created a demand for large-height aerial work platforms. Therefore, in order to meet the needs of domestic shopping malls and the public , Will inevitably intensify efforts to plan a large production height. 2. The weight of the lightweight boom system directly affects the fluctuation and stability of the aerial platform stacker. Following people's in-depth research on the boom system, people now have a certain understanding of the optimization of the boom structure, which makes people When planning the production boom, its structure and cross-section will be more reasonable, so that the weight of the boom itself can be reduced. 3. Multifunctionalization Now, in addition to some high-altitude operation equipment, it is generally equipped with fire-fighting water pumps, fire-fighting water tanks and other fire-fighting equipment. At the same time, it can also be equipped with some high-altitude escape equipment, such as high-altitude escape bags, to complete high-altitude rescue. , The future aerial work platform is bound to be a high-performance work vehicle with multiple functions. 4. Serialization is undoubtedly an important trend in the development of aerial work platforms. This is in terms of the enterprise's anti-hazard ability. From a global perspective, many well-known construction machinery companies, such as Terex Corporation of the United States, have gradually completed their product serialization and formed various products with different standards. 5.

        "text":"\n\nWhether you are a hobbyist welder or work in welding as a profession, you should always wear the proper safety gear.\n\nWearing the proper safety gear while welding will prevent burns and eye injuries to you giving you a safer work environment.\n\nOne of the most overlooked pieces of safety equipment is arm protection. Trust me, I have felt sparks from another person welding on my arm when I was not even close to the welder and they do burn you even if they land on you for a split second.\n\nSafety is our number one priority so we can continue doing what we love to do; welding! Arm protection is made available in various options, from full welding coats to welding sleeves.\n\nToday we will review welding sleeves which just go on the arms and around part of the chest and then come off with either zippers or snaps.\n\nIRONCAT 7000 Heat Resistant Leather Cape Sleeve Review\n\nThe Ironcat 7000 is one of the best welding sleeves you can find around. It is a heat-resistant leather cape sleeve. Just to make sure we are on the same line, it is one of the highest quality welding sleeves available in multiple sizes from medium to 4 extra-large.\n\nThe Ironcat 7000 has cowhide leather capes which include soapstone storage pockets with adjustable snaps on the collar and wrist making it more multifunctional. Additional leather makes it reinforced for added safety.\n\nWith tanned cape sleeves, this welding cape is designed to provide the best heat resistance during welding projects. This protects the welder from spatter and sparks.\n\nYou can use the welding sleeve for multiple uses including shipyards, gas welding, steel mills, torch work, construction, hobbyist welders, manufacturing, and automotive assembly.\n\nIt features stitched Kevlar threads that offer heat resistance. You can use this with a safety bib to add extra safety.\n\nThere are 11\u201d armholes, 22\u201d neck opening, 26\u201d chest width, 25\u201d sleeve length and 10.5\u201d body length with a large size split leather cape.\n\nTillman 5218E Heavyweight 18\u2033 Sleeves Review\n\nThe 18\u201d sleeves are made from Bourbon brown side split cowhide to give optimum heat resistance while welding.\n\nEach arm sleeve has a 2&1\/4\u201d external elastic sleeve on both sides of the sleeve to keep it tight and prevent sliding while working.\n\nAdded heat protection is given with the use of sewn Kevlar threads in the sleeves.\n\nYou can use the sleeves as a hobbyist welder or for a profession including gas welding.\n\nThe Tillman 5218E sleeves are sold as a pair of two and they are a max weight of only one pound!\n\nThere are many great reviews about the sleeves as they do the job just as well as some popular more expensive brands. There are some people that state the sleeves get uncomfortable after a lot of use but it does not affect them while they are welding.\n\nWaylander Welding Leather Sleeves Review\n\nThe Waylander arm sleeves offer protection for grilling, welding, grinding, woodcutting, and gardening.\n\nThick leather will protect your arms against heat while working. They will not stop a chainsaw from cutting through the material like chainsaw chaps though. There is an option to get these sleeves with or without a satin interior lining.\n\nThere is an adjustable upper arm with elastic to prevent slipping and being uncomfortable while wearing the sleeves. The sleeve dives right into your work gloves.\n\nSplit thick cowhide leather offers ultimate arm protection for hobbyist and professional welders.\n\nThe hems of the Waylander Welding Sleeves are hemmed and sewn with Kevlar threads. Kevlar adds strength and heat resistance to the sleeves.\n\nSleeve specifications are a length of 21 inches and circumference of 17 inches. The weights of the sleeves are like other similar sleeves of only 1 pound and are also sold as a pair.\n\nLincoln Electric Welding Sleeves Review\n\nLincoln Electric is trusted by industry professionals and has close to a decade of use in the industry.\n\nThe welding sleeves provide elastic cuffs to keep spatter out and hold the sleeves in the proper position. They include a flame retardant cotton top to improve comfort and mobility and the leather area provides spatter and heat resistance.\n\nFor those wondering; the lower and middle portions of the sleeves are 75% leather while the upper portion is made of the 25% 9-ounce flame retardant cotton.\n\nEach sleeve is 21 inches in length to provide full arm coverage on most people. While it does not state they are sewn with Kevlar, Lincoln Electric states it is a high-strength thread to prevent ripping and fraying.\n\nThis set of sleeves can be used as primary or secondary arm protection for welding. They are designed for long-term use so don\u2019t be nervous if you are looking to purchase these for your job and using them daily.\n\nBuying Guide \u2013 How to find the best welding sleeves for your needs.\n\nSleeve Style: Depending on what your personal style is, you will have to decide if you want to purchase sleeves, a cape, or a full leather jacket. While we did not review leather jacket styles, it is a more expensive option. Sleeves and capes are cheaper but still offer the maximum protection to welders. They are also easier to get on and off before and after a welding job.\n\nDurability: Be certain that the sleeves are made out of cowhide or leather to offer heat protection from spatter and sparks. It is also good to choose a set of sleeves with Kevlar stitching but it is not a necessity. Kevlar is resistant to high heat as well, and that is why we suggested it.\n\nBrand: Do you want a specific brand or does any brand work for you? Most offer the same protection and even the off brands have as high or higher reviews than the more popular brands on the market.\n\nSleeve Length: Measure your arms before purchasing to make sure the sleeves will cover your entire arm, especially if you are going to be in a t-shirt while welding. Safety against burns is an important aspect and this is the main reason you are looking to purchase the welding sleeves.\n\nWarranty: What is the welding sleeves warranty is there is any? If there is no warranty are you ok with this or will it sway you to purchase a product with a warranty?",
