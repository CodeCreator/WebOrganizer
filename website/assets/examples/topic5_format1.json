        "text":"\n\nWe've Got Accessories Covered\n\n  \u2022 My Cart\n\n    Your cart is empty\n\n    You have no items in your shopping cart.\n\nAdvanced Search\n\nTag Archives: Google\n\nMoshi for iPad\n  \u2022 Motorola Guy Kawasaki Twitter X Phone Customizable Rumor Motorola's Guy Kawasaki sparked rumors with a post about custom cars\n\n\n    In the world of mobile gadgets and accessories, it doesn't take much these days to start the rumor mill turning. So when Motorola advisor Guy Kawasaki made a Google+ post last week about a customizable car, the internet naturally started speculating about what that could mean regarding the rumored upcoming Google-Motorola X Phone.\n\n    The one line post, which reads, \"Wouldn't it be great if you could personalize your phone like this,\" has prompted many to wonder whether the X Phone will itself be customizable. (The X Phone\u00a0hasn't yet been officially announced, by the way.)\n\n    Some are really running with the rumor. AndroidAndMe posited that \"customers will be able to customize their devices,\" choosing their color, as well as \"some of the hardware specs like RAM and internal storage.\"\n\n    Going even further, AndroidAndMe\u00a0proposes the possibility that the X Phone won't just be one smartphone, but an entire line, designed to compete with Samsung's Galaxy brand.\n\n    So, is this taking Kawasaki's Tweet way too far? Maybe so and maybe not. As CNET points out:\n\n    \"Surely, the timing of Kawasaki's comments is not coincidental. Or is it? In the age of Reddit and Internet trolling, I begrudgingly must reserve some skepticism for the rumor. Is Guy having a bit of fun with his fan base or is he legitimately gauging public interest?\"\n\n    If there's truth to the speculation, this could be a major follow-up to Google's previous smartphone offering, the more or less standard Nexus 4. But we'll probably find out for sure soon enough. As CNET notes, \"should there be fire behind the smoke, this is the sort of rumor that won't be contained for long.\"\n\n\n    Enhanced by Zemanta\n\n    There have been 0 comments\n  \u2022 Google X phone rumors shatter proof flexible display Google's CEO has been fuelling rumors of a Motorola-made shatter-proof Google X phone\n\n\n    According to some recent rumors, Google and Motorola may just be working on a phone that that can go without the usual protective cases and accessories.\n\n    Mashable reported recently on a rumored Motorola-made Google phone termed the Google X, which has been stirring up speculation since at the Wall Street Journal\u00a0broached the topic this past fall. Still, there's been little information as to what the new phone's specs might be.\n\n    But in a recent interview with WIRED magazine, Google CEO Larry Page gave us a pretty fresh hint \u2013 the Google X may be unbreakable:\n\n    \"There\u2019s a lot of room for innovation in hardware [...] The phones we use now have glass that everyone worries will break if they drop the device. Five or 10 years from now, that will be different.\"\n\n    Needless to say, Page is a reliable source when it comes to what we can expect from a Google-backed phone. And some are positing theories that the Google X may sport a flexible display or may, at the very least, be shatter-proof.\n\n    \"The benefits of a 'bendy' phone are questionable, but using a flexible display would result in a phone that's much more immune to shattering, unlike the\u00a0relatively fragile\u00a0touch screens of today,\" says Mashable.\n\n    If these theories hold any water, Google may have a product on its hands that doesn't even need the shock-absorption of a case. And while that's bound to make users happy, third-party accessories makers probably wouldn't be thrilled.\n\n    But all this is moot anyway, since Google hasn't officially confirmed the existence of the Google X, much less its design specs. Until they do, the talk of a case-less, shatter-proof, bendy Google \u00a0phone will have to remain squarely in the realm of speculation.\n\n    Enhanced by Zemanta\n\n    There have been 0 comments\n\n  \u2022 Amid the slew of smartphones being released right in time for the holiday shopping season, Google's new LG-made Nexus 4 is winning the popularity contest.\n\n    Within hours of going on sale on the U.K.'s Google Play store on Monday, the latest nexus smartphone sold out. Same story in Australia, except that the successor to Google's Nexus 7 Tablet, the Samsung-made nexus 10, was also listed as \"out of stock\" before the day's end.\n\n    Meanwhile, \u00a0BGR reported that\u00a0in the U.S., it took only minutes before all available units of both the\u00a08GB and 16GB models of the Nexus 4 sold out on Google Play. And before long,\u00a032GB models of the Nexus 10 were out of stock, with only 10 units of the 16GB model remaining.\n\n    To use the old adage, tehy're selling like hotcakes. But it's not hard to see why.\n\n    Starting at $299 for the unlocked Nexus 4, the pricing is pretty competitive compared to other smartphones, especially considering its specs:\u00a0Snapdragon S4 quad-core processor,\u00a04.7-inch True HD IPS screen with a resolution of\u00a01280\u00d7768 resolution, and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean to boot.\n\n    However, it doesn't have LTE \u2013 if it did, people would probably be killing each other for it at that price \u2013 but TechCrunch is right in saying that it's essentially \"a high-end 3G device for a mid-range price.\"\n\n    Likewise, there's no reason that demand for the Nexus 10 Tablet should cool down anytime soon. Starting at $399.99, it's greatest draw is its super-sized 10.1\" 330PPI display, one of the biggest tablet screens out there.\n\n    There have been 0 comments\n  \u2022 Carphone Warehouse leaked, well, everything about the next Nexus smartphone\n\n\n    As writer Ernest Hamlin Abbott once put it,\u00a0\"rumors are not news; but they sometimes foreshadow news.\"\n\n    And, boy, have the rumors ever been stacking up concerning Google's next Nexus device, even though Google's expected to be saving any official news about it until their October 29 event.\n\n    Still, between the speculation that the new Android phone will be LG-made, the pictures, and even a premature review, we've already learned quite a bit about the upcoming Nexus 4.\n\n    And today, a new leak from retailer Carphone Warehouse revealed pretty much everything else, right down to the LG phone's specs, price and expected release date.\n\n    Advertising pre-orders for the phone, Carphone Warehouse has listed a price of \u00a3389.95. And their description boasts that the new smartphone has a 4.7\" LCD display, and\u00a0\"the\u00a0fastest and smoothest version of Android yet,\"\u00a0Android OS 4.2 Jelly Bean, as well as some new features:\n\n    \"Search gets smarter with Google Now. You ask. Google answers, instantly, and with all the detail you want... Stay in touch with Gesture Typing, a faster way of typing that lets you spell words by dragging your finger across the screen from letter to letter.\"\n\n    Meanwhile, Carphone Warehouse sets October 30 as the start date for delivery, just one day after Google's event. Though, after this last and possibly most comprehensive leak, there isn't much Google could tell us about their latest smartphone that we don't already know.\n\n    There have been 0 comments\n\n  \u2022 A couple of weeks ago a jury agreed with Apple in their latest lawsuit against Samsung, awarding Apple over $1 billion supporting its claim that Samsung infringed on their patents in the design of eight Samsung mobile phones and one tablet. But, there is method to Apple\u2019s madness, and it isn\u2019t putting Samsung out of business.\n\n    What this verdict does give Apple is the upper hand in \u201cnegotiations\u201d that are being conducted through the courts all over the world. Apple\u2019s opponents include five of their largest competitors in the global war for smartphone and tablet dominance. It\u2019s not just Apple claiming patent violations. Most of the mobile behemoths are fighting amongst themselves over license agreements.\n\n    Apple big beef with its device-making rivals like Samsung, it that they use the Android operating system that Google gives away for free. According to Bloomberg Industries, Android accounts for about 60 percent of the mobile market, three times as large as Apple\u2019s iOS. The big prize Apple has its sights on is having the dominant operating system in the device market. The problem many consumers, app designers and device manufacturers should have with Apple\u2019s OS is that it\u2019s a closed-garden operating system while Google\u2019s (and Microsoft\u2019s) is an open system. This means that Apple controls everything. (This was a point that Steve Jobs was always fanatical about.)\n\n    U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh will probably deny a request by Samsung to throw out the verdict. Samsung\u2019s lawyers will file an appeal in a higher court.\n\n    Koh will still have to decide whether to issue an injunction blocking the sale in the U.S. of the nine Samsung devices in the latest lawsuit. If she decides in favor of Apple, Samsung will have to make some design changes, eliminating the offending features or pull them from the market. Samsung probably won\u2019t expend too much effort on this since the nine devices are older ones, and they can still sell them outside the U.S. The hit to their bottom line should be minimal.\n\n    Once the competitors get some legal satisfaction, they\u2019ll make their financial deals over supplying products and components to one another. Even Apple will play nice. (Apple is Samsung\u2019s biggest customer for mobile-device components).In the meantime, the companies are still doing business as usual with one another while they keep their lawyers busy in court.\n\n    Telecom companies and consumers aren\u2019t going to put up with a clearing out of the competition by Apple. Many of us like Android devices like Samsung\u2019s, and Microsoft\u2019s Windows Phone OS is a welcome addition to the competition. Bottom line: what ultimately happens from all this bickering is up to us.\n\n    This post was posted in Apple, General, News and PR, Samsung, Smartphones and was tagged with patent lawsuits, patent wars, android os, Samsung, Google, Apple\n\n  ...

        "text":"Tag: Toshiba\n\nMicron front runner to buy Elpida shares\n\nMicron is tipped to be the front runner to aquire bankrupt memory manufacturer\u00a0Elpida, according to industry sources.\n\nThe company is said to be prepared to splash around up to $1.5 billion for the rival, pushing it ahead of the likes of Toshiba and Globalfoundries.\n\nElpida is facing bids from chip companies after racking up $5.5 billion in debts and being unable to pay them. It announced its bankruptcy late last month and was quickly dumped by old friend Hitachi, which sold off all its shares in the company.\n\nHynix also proved that it was out for what it could get and showed no remorse for the company when it proudly announced that it had seen a \u201cmarked growth\u201d in the number of clients asking to secure big DRAM orders.\n\nSome industry watchers originally thought that Samsung would be a main contender in the bidding war, however, it distanced itself from the company \u2013 telling TechEye that it had no plans to jump in Elpida\u2019s grave.\n\nThis left Micron, Toshiba and Globalfoundries as potential candidates to get a piece of the chip company. \u00a0\n\nAccording to Tom\u2019s Hardware,\u00a0Elpida\u2019s value lies mainly its Hiroshima manufacturing facility, which is estimated to be worth about $1 billion. It is believed that this is the main attraction for bidders who would pay more if they had to build a plant from scratch.\n\nMicron does have some cash to splash with its balance sheet listing around $2.1 billion in available cash and short term investments.\n\nIt\u2019s also been buying more into the market recently acquiring Intel\u2019s shares in the flash memory joint-venture IM Flash.\n\nWestern Digital strangely unworried by SSDs\n\nWestern Digital reckons that the hype around Ultrabooks is unlikely to hurt its HDD business any time soon.\n\nAccording to Danny Mauerhofer, head of communications for EMEA & India, Western Digital is not expecting a big challenge from the increasing popularity of SSDs.\n\nDespite claims that SSDs are edging their way into becoming a truly mainstream product, Mauerhofer reckons that they are \u201cnot complete\u201d just yet, and unlikely to challenge in either the consumer or business space.\n\nMauerhofer believes that there\u2019s little to show that HDDs will take a battering, even with cloud computing on the increase there is a clear need for large amounts of storage with strong demand from datacentres, but even in consumer devices there is little to show that HDDs will take a battering he reckons.\n\nMauerhofer says that in the halls of CeBit, hype has surrounded netbooks in years gone by with claims at the time that they would use flash drives by the bucket load.\u00a0 This hasn\u2019t transpired and Western Digital does not appear to be overly concerned about a new wave of mobile devices which are heralded as helping bring SSDs to the masses.\n\nEven if the Ultrabook performs well, Western Digital does not believe that many devices will feature HDDs, and the format is still in its infancy, he says.\n\nLarge costs for building factories are also a problem, WD said to us.\n\nWestern Digital is obviously not shying away from HDD production.\u00a0 The firm is about to announce the final details of its $4.5 billion deal to take over Hitachi.\n\nThe deal has been pushed back, with Mauerhofer telling us that the regulatory frame work has been very \u201ctime consuming\u201d. \u00a0He remained tight lipped on further details regarding the deal, with more info on its way with an announcement soon.\n\nHDD business to become Mexican standoff\n\nThe HDD business will soon become a three-way shoot-out, with only Seagate, Western Digital and Toshiba to provide mechanical storage media for our storage hunger.\n\nAfter a few years of consolidation and general HDD upheaval, the market is now reduced to just three players who control the entire hard drive business. These three players, despite standing under the apparent fallout of the Thai flooding, are now in a privileged position to make a tidy sum.\n\nSeagate completed its acquisition of Samsung\u2019s HDD business at the end of 2011, and through this has also tapped some cutting edge NAND kit to boost its hybrid drive lineup.\n\nWestern Digital, on the other hand, will see final approval on the acquisition of Hitachi GST (n\u00e9e IBM), bar freak accidents, later this month, but has been forced to find a buyer for part of its 3.5-inch HDD business to see approval from market regulators.\n\nThis leaves Toshiba, which has traditionally been very strong in the mobile HDD business, to pick up the leftover 3.5-inch business at Hitachi. WD will absorb Hitachi, two of its 3.5-inch HDD plants will be traded to Toshiba, and WD will in turn receive a 2.5-inch HDD manufacturing facility, leveling out the two partners\u2019 capacities in both segments.\n\nToshiba, despite being the smallest of the three remaining players, is the one with the most SSD experience, and can now vertically integrate several market segments, from consumer to enterprise to ultramobility.\n\n\nWD versus Seagate\n\nNotwithstanding the maneuvering taking place in the foreground, 2011 was marked by floods in Thailand that stalled HDD shipments and essentially threw off the entire PC market as supply fell to an estimated 40 percent of its pre-flooding level. Most PC companies revised their numbers based on the overall recession period, but the official line was the HDD shortage.\n\nSeagate, on the other hand, counted its blessings as the flood in Thailand \u2013 all things considered \u2013 was an act of a benevolent God.\n\nAccording to Fang Zhang, storage analyst at IHS iSuppli, Seagate was by mere coincidence spared the brunt of the disaster as it had both its factories on high ground, while not a single WD facility escaped the rising waters. Toshiba\u2019s HDD facility in Thailand was also hit hard. This generated a windfall for Seagate as it became the prime supplier of hard-drives in the last quarter of 2011, according to an iSuppli report. Western Digital had 60 percent of its total HDD manufacturing capacity submerged under the raging flood waters.\n\nBelow you can see the role-reversal. WD lost the top spot while falling to almost two-thirds of its prior market share. Seagate took over the top spot\u2026 and then some.\n\nHDD Market Share Q3, Q4 2011 - Source: iSuppli\n\nIn a post-consolidation world, at Q4-2011 shares, this will look somewhat like this, however, Techeye believes this will come closer to a 40\/40\/20 split as production resumes at WD and Toshiba takes on some 3.5-inch drive capacity.\n\nPost-consolidation 2012 HDD share estimate\n\nAlthough supply crashed, average selling prices (ASPs) jumped \u2013 for all manufacturers \u2013 and the only real problem now is how to handle the demand. With the average selling price shooting up, gross margins reached record highs. WD, for example, had its gross margin rise from $46 to $69, a 32.5 percent increase.\n\nNo tears were shed at the company HQ, we are sure.\n\nPost-Thai flooding, HDD manufacturers are now in control of a business they had let run amok. Their two primary concerns being how to keep up their Long Term Agreements (LTA), which usually account for the biggest slice of their business means getting PC OEMs, ODMs vendors and build-to-order their precious storage kit in ample supply. The other concern is to manage the product mix, while it is tempting to think the triumvirate will churn out 3 and 4TB drives like there is no tomorrow, it will have to switch around capacities to keep up with their supply contracts\u2026 of course that signing up for a LTA as soon as possible will guarantee you the best deal, and Seagate is counting on that.\n\nEveryone else will basically be on a morphine drip waiting for something to fall out of the back of a truck.\n\nUnfortunately for consumers and businesses, HDDs will be in short supply for the remainder of the year, say the HDD manufacturers. Seagate estimates that supply will reach around 80% of its former maximum by the end of 2012. This reflects both the market consolidation and the time it takes to retool\/rebuild after the Thai flood. The truth will be somewhere in between.\n\nThe Thai flood has also given the HDD business much to think about, in particular in what regards to future processes and products. Vertical integration was already the order of the day, but most HDD manufacturers are looking to leverage hybrid drives as the next big thing. and vertical integration is the easiest way to go.\n\nThis particular expression was dropped by Pat O\u2019Malley, Seagate CFO, a couple of times during the Morgan Stanley conference last week. Seagate hasn\u2019t been completely blind to the market\u2019s ebb and flow, and part of the company\u2019s reasoning behind the Samsung storage acquisition was to provide Seagate with the technology and tools they needed to outpace their competitors in the hybrid market.\n\nDuring the course of 2012, it will be clear that hybrid drives were the \u2018next big thing\u2019 and all three of the HDD players will move into hybrid disk drives as fast as their factories can spit them out. Hybrid drives provide plentiful storage, with today\u2019s platter capacities and blistering fast reads and writes to its small Flash cells. Prices, despite being clearly higher than your traditional HDD, aren\u2019t over the top.\n\nThen come the niche markets that offer better margins than your \u2018standard\u2019 consumer desktop. Intel has been pushing hard for its Ultrabook initiative to be a major success and despite it being received enthusiastically by PC manufacturers \u2013 as an opportunity to match up against Apple\u2019s Macbook Air \u2013 it\u2019s greatest virtue might be pushing out the door 7mm hybrid drives.\n\nO\u2019Malley had previously taken the opportunity to touch base with Intel Ultrabook partners by laying out the ground rules for being on the gravy train: you have to be able to make 7mm-thick (0.3-inch).\n\nSeagate, Hitachi and Toshiba are currently the only hard-drive manufacturers to carry 7mm drives in their product portfolios; however the WD takeover at Hitachi means that all three main players will be able to manufacture the premium fo...
