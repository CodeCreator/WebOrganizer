It allows you to block cookies until you obtain the consent of the user accessing your website. And the possibility to select the type of cookies to be installed among functional and third party ones.\nOur module fully complies with the European Law on Cookies, the LOPD and the directives of the LSSI and guarantees you complete protection. Updated to comply with the latest modifications of the RGPD.\nFull compliance with the European Law on Cookies (last modifications of the RGPD \u2013 Update 2021)\nNew customisable informative responsive configuration banner.\nIn addition to inserting a warning banner, it is the only module that allows third party modules that use cookies to be blocked until the user gives his consent.\nFurthermore, it gives you the option of customising the module to comply 100% with the\u00a0new requirements of the RGPD\u00a0(European Union). Our Cookies module complies with the\u00a0Right of Rectification, with it users can delete the cookies installed from the site simply by accessing a url or even from their own customer profile.\nObtaining consent\nThe user has to click on the \u201cI accept\u201d button in the warning banner to give his consent. As soon as the client gives his consent, the warning banner disappears and all the modules that use cookies will be activated and will work as usual. The user can configure the type of cookies to which he or she wants to give consent by clicking on the \u2018Manage Cookies\u2019 button and selecting which cookies he or she wants to activate or not.\nBlocking Cookies\nThe module allows the blocking of cookies until the user gives his consent. Cookies can be functional (mandatory) or from third parties. They allow the user to give his or her consent separately. This complies with the law as it differentiates the different types of cookies that the client accepts.\n  \u2022 Functional (mandatory) cookies:\u00a0includes the key cookies for the operation of the website. For example, save the login data, the shopping cart, etc.\n  \u2022 Third-party cookies:\u00a0includes cookies that collect data for tracking, segmentation, analysis, etc.\nIn order to comply with the directives of the LSSI, we recommend that you deactivate the tracking modules (such as Google Analytics), social network modules (Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d button, Google\u2019s \u201c+1\u201d button, etc.) and targeted advertising. Please note that the modules required for the proper functioning of your shop (e.g. shopping basket cookie, session cookie\u2026) do not require prior consent.\nL\u00ednea Gr\u00e1fica will in no case be responsible for any damage or harm caused by activating options which do not comply with the RGPD. The user is responsible for the legal texts which indicate the purpose of third party cookies. Please note that the user\/owner of the e-commerce where the module is installed is solely responsible for the legal texts to be introduced, such as the notice and explanation of the purpose of third party cookies. Linea Grafica will in no case be responsible for any damage or harm that may be caused by activating options that do not comply with the RGPD.\nRevocation of consent\nIn compliance with the law, the user may revoke their consent at any time. As soon as they withdraw their consent, the installed cookies are eliminated and consent is requested again.\nBanner content and customization\nTo comply with the LSSI, the module allows you to customize the message that appears in the warning banner (to inform about the cookies used and their purpose) and add a \u201cMore information\u201d button to the banner that takes the user to a CMS page of your website (to explain in detail the use of cookies in your store).\nThe notice banner is responsive and always occupies the entire width of the window. The module includes a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, color, effects, html code \u2026). You can also choose from the configuration page the background color of the banner, its opacity percentage (transparency) and its position (above or below the screen). In addition, the module is multi-language and automatically detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to write a different message per language.\nInformation: we have developed the module so that it does not appear when search engine robots crawl your website and that it does not affect your SEO.\nBlock screen until cookies are accepted\nTo help the online shop lose as little information as possible it has an option that does not allow the customer to browse until they accept the cookie policy, i.e. it blocks the screen until the user accepts the cookies.\nNotice in the form of a pop up\nThe module displays a pop up to inform your customers about the use of cookies and ask for their consent for their installation.\nMulti-store mode\nThe module is compatible with multi-store mode and allows you to put the same warning banner in each of your stores, but the consent is the same for all your stores. If you accept cookies for one of your stores, the module will consider that you have accepted cookies for all your stores (indicate this in the Cookies Policy) and the warning banner will not appear later in the other stores.\n\nWhat your customers will like\n\nThe best and only way to inform users about the use of cookies and respect their will and consent.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or problems with the module, please click on Contact the developer to get in touch with us, our team of certified developers is here to help you and will do all its best to solve your problem as soon as possible.

        "text":"Privacy Policy for App\n\nPrivacy Policy is a critical issue that every app developer must address. Also, there are an increasing number of jurisdictions that now have legal requirements regarding privacy practices. If the app developed by you using the SDK of LG Developer site collects and processes the personal and non-personal information of end users, please follow these guidelines. You also must comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to data protection and privacy.\n\nCollection Limitation and Security\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid security compromises of personal information is not to collect the information in the first place unless your app has a specific and legitimate reason for the collection. So, here are the brief privacy tips for designing and developing apps.\n\n- Minimize your data collection in the first place.\n- Develop your app to protect the security of your user's data in its collection, storage, and use.\n- Make your use of social features transparent, if any, so that users are aware of when they're sharing data socially.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nYour app should include a privacy policy that addresses topics such as what kind of information your app collects from or about your users, how that information is used, with whom it is shared, and how users can make privacy-related choices within the app. You should use plain language and avoid technical jargon, to help your end users understand easily. You should provide a mechanism for obtaining end user consent to the collection and processing of their information in accordance with the user\u2019s privacy policy before the collection of any such information. If possible, provide a control mechanism that allows a user to easily change permissions. You should not collect any information from end users (whether personal or otherwise) unless the appropriate consents have been given.\n\nCollection of Sensitive Information\n\nAn app's collection of sensitive personal information raises important privacy concerns. You should only collect access and use end user\u2019s information to the extent necessary for providing the app. The minimized and indispensable data collection will be preferred to avoid any needless troubles, problems or issues of compliances. After the information collection, put in place appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to secure and protect end user information. Please note that LGE is entitled to legal immunity on your app\u2019s privacy policy issues that caused any claims, suits, losses, damages, costs and expenses.",

        "text":"OAuth 2.0 Policies\n\nLast modified:\n\nThe applications and services you design and build with Google APIs must do more than provide value to users and businesses. We also require that they be secure and provide the appropriate level of privacy demanded by users. The following policies are part of the Google APIs Terms of Service. They apply to all developers who use OAuth 2.0, which includes OpenID Connect for authentication only. The policies below are a minimum set of requirements; we recommend that you take any additional steps necessary to ensure that your applications and systems are safe and secure.\n\nComply with all terms of service and policies\n\nThe use of Google API Services, which includes our implementation of OAuth 2.0, is governed by the Google APIs Terms of Service and Google API Services User Data Policy. In addition, the use of OAuth 2.0 is governed by this policy. Please read these documents carefully, as well as any other terms or policies that apply to any other Google products or services you are using. Be sure to check for updates periodically as these documents are occasionally updated.\n\nRegister an appropriate OAuth client\n\nEvery app that uses Google's OAuth 2.0 infrastructure for authentication or authorization must have at least one registered OAuth client. You must create a separate OAuth client for each platform on which your app will run, such as a web server, an Android app, an iOS app, or a limited-input device. You must choose the client type that best matches the platform. For instance, you should not use a \"web\" client type for your native Android or iOS app. You can register OAuth clients in the Google API Console. Please note that additional terms apply to your use of the Google Cloud Platform.\n\nIf you use Apps Script, OAuth clients are automatically created on your behalf, and you are still subject to the policies on this page. If you need to modify or manage your OAuth clients, you must switch your script project to a standard Cloud project.\n\nSome Google development platforms, such as Firebase and Actions on Google, automatically create Google Cloud projects and OAuth clients on your behalf. If you develop on these platforms, you are still subject to the policies on this page.\n\nUse separate projects for testing and production\n\nFor the purposes of these requirements, a \"production\" app meets the following criteria:\n\n  \u2022 It isn't for personal use. An app is considered to be for personal use if it's not shared with anyone else or will be used by fewer than 100 people (all of whom are known personally to you).\n  \u2022 It isn't used for development, testing, or staging.\n  \u2022 It isn't for internal use; that is, restricted to people in your Google Workspace or Cloud Identity organization.\n\nSome policies and requirements only apply to production apps. For this reason, you must create separate projects in the Google API Console for each deployment tier, such as development, staging, and production.\n\nMaintain a list of relevant contacts for the project\n\nProject owners and editors must be kept up-to-date. We'll send emails to those accounts when there are notifications about your project or updates to our services. Organization administrators must ensure that a reachable contact is associated with every project in their organization. If we don't have updated contact information for your project, you might miss out on important messages that require your action. This could result in the loss of your access to the Google APIs.\n\nGoogle Workspace users: Associate your project with an organization\n\nAt this time, your projects aren't required to exist within a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity Organization resource. However, you're strongly recommended to create new projects in an organization and migrate existing projects into an organization. This configuration allows your project to benefit from enterprise management including intra-domain usage. It can also prevent your project from becoming orphaned if the current project owner leaves your organization.\n\nHandle client credentials securely\n\nTreat your OAuth client credentials with extreme care, as they allow anyone who has them to use your app's identity to gain access to user information. Store your OAuth client information in a secure place and protect it, especially your client secret, just as you would a password. Where possible, use a secret manager, such as Google Cloud Secret Manager, to store client credentials. You must never commit client credentials into publicly available code repositories. We highly recommend that you avoid committing them to any code repository.\n\nHandle user tokens securely\n\nOAuth 2.0 tokens are entrusted to you by users who give you permission to act and access data on their behalf. Never transmit tokens in plaintext, and always store encrypted tokens at rest to provide an extra layer of protection in the event of a data breach. Revoke tokens when you no longer need access to a user's account or when your app no longer needs access to permissions that a user previously granted. After the tokens are revoked, delete them permanently from your application or system.\n\nAccurately represent your identity\n\nProvide a valid name and (optionally) a logo to show to users. This brand information must accurately represent the identity of the application. App branding information is configured when you set up OAuth 2.0 in the Google API Console Consent Screen page.\n\nFor production apps, brand information must be verified. Google can revoke or suspend access to Google API Services and other Google products and services for apps that misrepresent their identity or attempt to deceive users.\n\nIf you use Apps Script and want to verify your brand information, you must switch your script project to a standard Cloud project. If you use a Google development platform that manages OAuth clients on your behalf, such as Firebase or Actions on Google, your app settings there are used to configure your brand information. However, you must still use the Google API Console to submit your brand information for review.\n\nOnly request scopes that you need\n\nYou must only request the smallest set of scopes that are necessary for providing functionality knowingly chosen by the user. You must request scopes that require the least amount of access to user data necessary to provide that functionality. For example, an app that only uses Gmail APIs to occasionally send emails on a user's behalf shouldn't request the scope that provides full access to the user's email data. Data that you receive from Google APIs must only be used in the way that you represent to your users.\n\nYour project configuration in the Google API Console Consent Screen page must match the list of scopes requested by your app. When a change in app functionality or in Google APIs necessitates an update to the scopes that are used, you must revoke the tokens with the previously-used scopes that are no longer in use at the earliest opportunity and update your project configuration in the Google API Console. Proper configuration is particularly important for scopes that require verification; if an app is no longer approved to use them, Google may revoke tokens that contain these scopes at any time without notice.\n\nIf you use Apps Script, the OAuth client that's automatically created for you is configured to use the scopes that Apps Script identifies from your script. If your script requires different scopes, you must specify these scopes explicitly in your script's manifest file.\n\nSubmit production apps that use sensitive or restricted scopes for verification\n\nCertain scopes are classified as \"sensitive\" or \"restricted,\" and they can't be used in production apps without review. If your production app uses sensitive or restricted scopes, you must submit your use of those scopes for verification. You can submit for verification in the Google API Console from the Consent Screen page.\n\nIf you use Apps Script and you're writing a production script that uses sensitive or restricted scopes, you must switch your script project to a standard Google Cloud Platform project before you submit your use of those scopes for verification.\n\nOnly use domains you own\n\nOnly use redirect URIs and JavaScript origins that refer to domains that you own, that you have been authorized to use (for example, as part of your employment or as a vendor or contractor of a business), or that you have been explicitly given license to use (for example, as part of a service agreement for an identity management platform).\n\nHost a homepage for production apps\n\nEvery production app that uses OAuth 2.0 must have a publicly accessible home page. The homepage must include a description of the app's functionality, as well as links to terms of service and a privacy policy. The homepage must exist on a verified domain under your ownership.\n\nUse secure browsers\n\nA developer must not direct a Google OAuth 2.0 authorization request to an embedded user-agent under the developer's control. Embedded user-agents include, but are not limited to, software libraries that allow a developer to insert arbitrary scripts, alter the default routing of a request to the Google OAuth server, or access session cookies.

        "text":"UnboundID LDAP SDK Free Use License THIS IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (\"YOU\") AND PING IDENTITY CORPORATION (\"PING IDENTITY\") REGARDING YOUR USE OF UNBOUNDID LDAP SDK FOR JAVA AND ANY ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION, OBJECT CODE, COMPILED LIBRARIES, SOURCE CODE AND SOURCE FILES OR OTHER MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE BY PING IDENTITY (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO IN THIS AGREEMENT AS THE (\"SDK\"). BY INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SDK, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL, ACCESS OR USE THE SDK. USE OF THE SDK. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Ping Identity grants to You a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Ping Identity's intellectual property rights in the SDK, to use, reproduce, modify and distribute this release of the SDK; provided that no license is granted herein under any patents that may be infringed by your modifications, derivative works or by other works in which the SDK may be incorporated (collectively, your \"Applications\"). You may reproduce and redistribute the SDK with your Applications provided that you (i) include this license file and an unmodified copy of the unboundid-ldapsdk.jar file; and (ii) such redistribution is subject to a license whose terms do not conflict with or contradict the terms of this Agreement. You may also reproduce and redistribute the SDK without your Applications provided that you redistribute the SDK complete and unmodified (i.e., with all \"read me\" files, copyright notices, and other legal notices and terms that Ping Identity has included in the SDK). SCOPE OF LICENSES. This Agreement does not grant You the right to use any Ping Identity intellectual property which is not included as part of the SDK. The SDK is licensed, not sold. This Agreement only gives You some rights to use the SDK. Ping Identity reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives You more rights despite this limitation, You may use the SDK only as expressly permitted in this Agreement. SUPPORT. Ping Identity is not obligated to provide any technical or other support (\"Support Services\") for the SDK to You under this Agreement. However, if Ping Identity chooses to provide any Support Services to You, Your use of such Support Services will be governed by then-current Ping Identity support policies. TERMINATION. Ping Identity reserves the right to discontinue offering the SDK and to modify the SDK at any time in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Ping Identity may also, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend access to the SDK to You or any end user at any time. In addition, if you fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement, then any rights granted herein will be automatically terminated if such failure is not corrected within 30 days of the initial notification of such failure. You acknowledge that termination and\/or monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy if You breach this Agreement and that Ping Identity will be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a breach. Ping Identity may also terminate this Agreement if the SDK becomes, or in Ping Identity's reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation. All rights and licenses granted herein will simultaneously and automatically terminate upon termination of this Agreement for any reason. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SDK IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND PING IDENTITY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SDK WILL BE ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR TIMELY MANNER, OR WILL INTEROPERATE WITH OTHER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS OR DATA. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ALL CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF PING IDENTITY HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.

IN NO EVENT WILL PING IDENTITY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, COST OF COVER, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SDK OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF PING IDENTITY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS. Certain states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for certain kinds of damages, so the exclusion of limited warranties and limitation of liability set forth above may not apply to You. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The SDK is subject to United States export control laws. You acknowledge and agree that You are responsible for compliance with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the SDK. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement with respect to the SDK. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby. This Agreement and performance hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Any disputes related to this Agreement shall be exclusively litigated in the state or federal courts located in Travis County, Texas.",
