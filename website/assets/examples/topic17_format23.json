Some of the founding principles of this process date back to the creation and signing of the U.S. Constitution, while others began playing a role in the 1980s. In this Teach-Out, experts in Politics, Political Science, and Education at the University of Michigan, the University of Delaware, the University of Iowa, and the Iowa Caucus Project at Drake University will address the following questions: What is the US primary process? What are the differences and similarities between primaries vs caucuses? Why do Iowa and New Hampshire get to go first? What role do delegates play? What is Super Tuesday? Is there a difference between political parties in how the primary process functions? Do incumbent candidates have an advantage? How do other countries\u2019 voting processes differ?

        "text":"Review (Guest): How Much Have Global Problems Cost the World? A Scorecard From 1900 to 2050\n\nAmazon Page\n\nAmazon Page\n\nBjorn Lomberg et al\n\n2.0 out of 5 stars It just gets better and better!, November 15, 2013\n\nBy David Wineberg \u201cDavid Wineberg\u201d (New York, NY USA) \u2013 See all my reviews\u00a0 (TOP 1000 REVIEWER)\n\nMilton Berle once appeared for an interview on a morning TV show in New York. After, his interviewer threw to the weather woman. Berle left his seat and took over doing the weather. His analysis? A line of tornados ripped through New Jersey last night, causing $100 million in IMPROVEMENTS. That is the feeling I got with How Much Have Global Problems Cost the World?\n\nLomborg\u2019s Copenhagen Consensus got a bunch of academics to look at issues from a common denominator. Everything has to be evaluated as a percentage of GDP. Everything has to be monetized to make the models work. Lives, disease, biodiversity \u2013 everything gets a dollar value in these studies. Lack of historical data is not a problem either; the models \u201cbackcast\u201d to 1900. The conclusion is that our worrisome problems are an ever shrinking cost to us, relative to GDP.\n\nBut of course, prices have never reflected the ecological cost of production or use, so we\u2019ve been freeloading, with GDP expanding while costs have been controlled. The bill will go to our grandchildren. These models don\u2019t reflect that. Instead, the ballooning GDPs of the last century simply leave the cost centers in their wake, taking an ever smaller share.\n\nContinue reading\n\nReview: The Revenge of Geography: What the Map Tells Us About Coming Conflicts and the Battle Against Fate\n\nAmazon Page\n\nAmazon Page\n\nRobert Kaplan\n\n2.0 out of 5 stars Neither new nor original nor reliable, September 1, 2013\n\nI am getting pretty sick of Stratfor and the pimps of empire. There is nothing new in this book other than self-promotion. For better more original reads consider, among many, many others:\n\nZones of conflict: An atlas of future wars\n\nGuns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies\n\nGeography and natural resources are a starting point. How the population develops \u2014 including the degree to which it is educated, liberated, and empowered to innovate, matter. Deeper books along these lines include:\n\nPhilosophy and the Social Problem: The Annotated Edition\n\nPolitics Among Nations\n\nIn the end it boils down to clarity, diversity, integrity, and sustainability. I am quite tired of pundits recycling old knowledge, a practice made poissible by an ignorant public (including ignorant policy makers and deeply unethical politicians as well as a captive media that is both ignorant and complicit).\n\nBest wishes to all,\nRobert Steele\nINTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH: Clarity, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainability\n\nVote and\/or Comment on Review\n\nVote and\/or Comment on Review\n\nReview: Government Auditing Standards 2011 Version\n\nAmazon Page\n\nComptroller General\n\n2.0 out of 5 stars Mind-Numbing Waste of Time and Money,September 2, 2012\n\nI am *stunned* that any Comptroller General would sign off on this. In my 33 year government career this is the densest most meaningless compilation of words (no pictures, no figures, no timelines, no lists) of gobbly-goop I have ever seen (of course there are a great many such products from other government agencies I have not seen). If I were the Comptroller General, not only would I not sign off on this, I would consider permanent exile for the entire team responsible for this. It fails to enlighten or communicate \u2014 it is more like a \u201ccover your ass\u201d document.\n\nIn theory, this book is about independence of audits and the professional management of audits. In fact, this is strung together text, all of it making sense in isolation, and none of it useful to actually doing a real audit meaningful to We the People. This is a classic example of doing the wrong thing righter (Russell Ackoff).\n\nThe more I read into this the sadder I got. I have known for a long time that GAO, CBO, and CRS are creatures of a very corrupt Congress, and that Congress actually reserves the right to tell them what their assumptions (code for outcomes) will be, but until I read this I did not realize how disconnected the whole process is. Now I have to emphasize that I value actual GAO reports and I would never consider doing an internal executive audit without consulting both GAO and OMB (which does not do management, but you can at least try to find someone who\u2019s heard of the concept). What this book does is give me pause \u2014 if this is the GAO \u201cfoundation work\u201d if causes me to wonder what else about GAO is so corrupt (in the holistic not making sense of the word).\n\nThis book is available free online at the GAO website. I bought it because it never occurred to me that GAO would produce something from the Stone Age, and for serious thinking, I have to have it in writing in front of me subject to annotation and hand-eye-brain coordination.\n\nHere is the larger bottom line:\n\na) Congress authorizes and appropriates money based on corruption, personal, financial, and ideological \u2014 as long as Congress is getting its standard 5% kick-back, they will authorize and appropriate anything, from the bridge to nowhere to a stealth fighter that does not work as advertised, is unaffordable, and coated in toxins that kill the pilots stupid enough to fly something the USAF swears is safe.\n\nb) GAO is only authorized to audit for compliance with the original corrupt authorization and appropriation. They are not authorized to blow the whistle on insane, unaffordable expenditures.\n\nc) Within the Executive, taking NSA as a classic example, the focus is on keeping money moving and growing the pie because that is how the Executive creates more and more flag and senior executive positions, and that is how those flags and senior executives \u201cpay forward\u201d the reverse bribes that will get them follow-on careers with the contractors that will build any insane unafforable and generally inoperable (SAIC and Trailblazer come to mind) \u201ccapability\u201d that Congress has authorized and appropriated.\n\nd) When NSA is inspected from within the Executive, the focus is NOT on the why, on the cost, on the \u201cfit\u201d with any given strategy or other related programs, but on the allocation authority and whether NSA is spending the money as directed, never mind whether it works or not. This is one reason why I believe that both Inspectors General and Operational Test & Evaluation should be part of the Intelligence Directorate of any given Cabinet office, just as I believe that education, intelligence, and research must be asuthorized, appropriated, allocated, constructed, and evaluated as a whole.\n\nIt is with a grimace that I prepare to donate this book to the Oakton VA library. It is a perfect example of corrupt perfection. Argh.\n\nRobert David Steele\nINTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH: Clarity, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainability\n\nVote and\/or Comment on Review\n\nReview: The Decline of American Power \u2013 The US in a Chaotic World\n\nAmazon Page\n\nImmanuel Wallerstein\n\n2.0 out of 5 stars Price for 160 Pages Beneath Contempt,November 16, 2011\n\nI am angry\u2013I really wanted to buy and read this book, but a price of $50 for 160 pages is beneath contempt. The author is being abused by the publisher and I urge the author to consider a new publisher for the paperback, or demanding that the paperback be published immediately. Barnes and Noble has been shut down by Amazon \u2014 all other publishers appear in intent on staving off their ultimate demise in the face of on demand publishing by gouging the public.\n\nThis book in hardcopy should not be sold for more than $25, and in paperback for $16. Please join me in boycotting this publisher, as someone who cares deeply about the dissemination of important knowledge \u2014 which the author clearly offers \u2014 I find this pricing an utter outrage.\n\nHere are some reasonably priced books that I offer as a substitute\u2013my \u201ctop ten\u201d if you will.\nContinue reading",

        "text":"Book Review\uff1aDraft of the Revision of the Constitution done by the Liberal Democrats with its lines in red by Ito Makoto \/ Ootukishoten \/ May 2013\n\n\u3000\u3000The author, Ito Makoto, an expert guru on the Japanese Constitution, examines the adequacy of the Liberal Democrats\u2019 draft, comparing it with the present Constitution. Reading this book gives the reader an understanding of constitutional theory, which holds that the country exists to defend the dignity of each individual and the freedom of its people. A constitution regulates the national authority\u2019s obligation to safeguard human rights. Individual dignity is made the basic value of the nation. I feel especially that the principles that pay absolute consideration to the weak and minority groups are extremely valuable.\n\u3000\u3000The present Japanese Constitution was based on this sort of constitutional theory and, although many have the impression that it was imposed by the GHP, in fact representatives of the people chosen in a general election participated in the discussions and added corrections to the original text.\n\u3000\u3000By way of contrast, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 recent draft tends to value \u201cpeople\u201d more than concrete individuals, \u201cfamilies\u201d more than people, and the \u201cnation\u201d more than families. In other words, in the final analysis, the nation should be defended and the impression is given that people have an obligation towards the nation. According to the Constitution now in force, the role of the nation is to defend the freedom of each individual, something basically compatible with the principles of constitutional theory. The draft offered to revise the Constitution is not an amendment. It is rather a scheme to establish a new system with the nation at the center and thus provide a basis for the government\u2019s plan to spare no pain to go to war for the nation.\n\u3000\u3000This book makes one aware that the issue of constitutional amendment is either about establishing Japan as a nation where people are the main actors or else making it into a hero nation. I realized that the unavoidable issue in question was the whereabouts of the Japanese people themselves.\n(Yamamoto Keisuke, staff member of\u3000Tokyo Jesuit Social Center)\n\n\nComments are closed.",

This 624-page manual complements the romance and idealism of the earlier work, with both practical information and instruction. Note that it's \"an\" anarchist cookbook, rather than \"the\" anarchist cookbook (of which there are actually two, one about making bombs and the other about making soup and community). This book is about cooking up a movement, and understanding the terminology and landscape of what's out there, including topics like coalition building, affinity groups, mental health, sabotage, squatting, wheat-pasting, and more. It's illustrated. It's annotated. It's got first person stories and technical recipes and diagrams. It's got a great preface. All told, this is your one stop shop for building a fearsome career of direct action against oppression on all fronts.\n\n\n\nThis book is, by far, the greatest book I have EVER picked up. It's full of nifty manuals on how to do things to abolish capitalism, get through some rough shit, etc. HIGHLY recomended to every person of all ages in every political party.\n\n\n\nThis is Crimethinc's answere to anyone who wondered where to start after reading Days.\nThis book is overflowing with recipes that are not only useful but also a lot of fun. Something new for anyone, no matter how informed or creative.\n\n\nThis is wonderful. CrimethInc takes a lot of crap for being vague and over-romantic, for being wishy-washy. This should silence the nay-sayers. Indispensable to anyone who might benefit from concretely living their dreams into being.\n\nSteev Hise's review of this book",

Viking, $32.95 (400p) ISBN 978-0-670-02594-7\nWashington Post chief correspondent Balz\u2019s The Battle for America 2008 (coauthored with Haynes Johnson) explored that truly groundbreaking campaign, which left him struggling to find a similarly enthralling story in the race between a Republican nobody wanted, and an incumbent Democrat with whom voters were disillusioned. The book provides an astute postmortem of the election and a remarkably unbiased depiction of a flawed process feeding on a polarized electorate, which, if little else, demonstrates the preposterous expense of the 2012 campaign. Balz shares revealing accounts of his firsthand experiences with the candidates, with the bulk of the book focused on the Republic primaries, in which the G.O.P. sought an \u201canyone but Romney\u201d solution. As Michelle Bachman, Rick Perry, and Herman Cain incongruously blaze to front-runner status before self-immolating, Newt Gingrich bides his time and gives Balz the story each step of the way. Given Obama\u2019s opaque public persona, it\u2019s not surprising that less is revealed of the incumbent, which leaves Balz reporting on strategy over substance. In framing the book, Balz asks, \u201cCan or will the election resolve any of the fundamental issues before the country?\u201d After scrutinizing this season of destructive political gamesmanship, he answers gloomily, \u201cThere was little competition or innovation in the battle for ideas... each [candidate] pursued a strategy designed for one thing: winning.\u201d Agent: Philippa Brophy, Sterling Lord.

        "text":"\n\nReview by Theresa Wolfwood\n\n\u201cWe should be clear that foreign military inventions kill and that the Conservatives\u2019 climate change policy is devastating many of the world\u2019s most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nEngler is rapidly becoming one of Canada\u2019s major political researchers & analysts. This is his latest of six books on topics ranging from Haiti to Palestine. His last book was an analysis of Lester Pearson\u2019s political career and legacy.\n\nEngler Harper CoverHarper is what we have now, even if, as Engler reminds us, he only received 39% of our votes. Since taking office in 2006, Harper has set Canada\u2019s foreign policy to please and profit a tiny group of large corporations and right-wing ideologues. No surprise to most of us as Engler documents our militaristic role in Haiti, Libya, Iran, and Lebanon making us on the world scene, \u201ca warrior nation\u201d. Creating a culture of war includes not only our government\u2019s total disregard for human rights when it suits it, as in Libya and Haiti military intervention, but also includes generous support of arms industries with our tax money (and Canada Pension Plan investments) which sell not only to the USA, as ever, but also to other human rights abusers and countries at war, including Bahrain, Israel, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. Many generous trade and investment deals accompany these sales along with tax money to help market our products.\n\nCanada is also a global pariah because of Harper\u2019s policy of climate change (no policy really, just business as usual) and his relentless support of the Tar Sands development and big oil companies. Engler documents in plain words his statement, \u201cHarper\u2019s actions as prime minster suggest he doesn\u2019t care if human activity is warming the planet.\u201d\u00a0\n\nEngler examines in lengthy detail Harper\u2019s love for Israel, ignoring the brutal\u00a0 occupation of and war on Palestine; we are \u201cIsrael\u2019s best friend.\u201d\u00a0 Unfortunately there has been little opposition from other major parties in Canada since 1948 to this enduring policy.\n\nThe author says Canada since 2006 \u201cis offside from the world community on a host of issues.\u201d \u00a0Losing his bid for a seat on the UN Security Council was a humiliation resulting from Harper\u2019s \u201csabotaging international efforts to improve health and environmental standards\u2026aggressive lobbying on behalf of tar sands producers\u2026unflinching support of Israeli aggression\u2026its tacit support for a military coup in Honduras and [Canada] angered the Venezuelan government by meddling in that country\u2019s political affairs.\u201d\n\nOur support of mining companies abroad has caused massive environmental damage and social degradation leading to community conflict and violence. Community activists have been murdered at major Canadian mine sites across the world.\n\nEngler urges us to be active in social movements that work for justice, peace, equality and a healthy planet; more than that he urges us to make the connections between issues so our social movements will work together to create stronger and more effective actions and results. Many progressive Canadians focus much needed effort on domestic issues \u2013 healthcare, education, poverty, unfair taxation to name a few; Engler makes a convincing case that all domestic issues are linked to our less scrutinized foreign policy; we have to make the connection and link our issues of concern and our actions.\u00a0 In this book and his talks across Canada, he reminds us of the success of the Quebec student movements, calls on us to focus on defeating the most vulnerable Conservative candidates in the next election, to organize at every level and that, \u201cOur goal should be to force open the narrow parameters of foreign policy debate\u2026It\u2019s time to turn\u2026 anger into action.\u201d\n\n\nFiled under Book Reviews, Yves Engler",
