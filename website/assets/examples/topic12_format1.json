The methods include oral contraceptives (the Pill) as well as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) such as intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants (e.g., Implanon), or injectables (e.g., Depo-Provera).

Fortunately, most of the risk occurs to a minority of patients. Thus, it is prudent to identify those at risk and attempt to prevent the morbidity and mortality. Some factors contributing to risk are quite obvious, but others are very subtle. Thus, care must be taken in definitions, screening programs, and application of the tools available for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n    pdf50p lananhanh123 27-08-2011 41 4 \u00a0\u00a0Download\n\n  \u2022 The medical model emphasises health care and remedial treatment. Greater importance needs now to be attached to primary prevention and health promotion and with which there is a heightened need for people to accept their personal responsibility and individual accountability.
