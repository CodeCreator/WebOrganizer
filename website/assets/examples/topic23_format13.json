The concept will provide everything that is needed to exhibit including individual stand space, electricity and furniture as well as a Hosted Buyer diary of appointments over the 3 days of the show. Hotels just need to show up, brand their space and start their business meetings. Every exhibitor will also be able to join in the networking, education sessions and many functions that are part of ibtm world 2016 www.ibtmworld.com\n\n\nDescribing this new feature, Graeme Barnett, Senior Exhibition Director, ibtm world said; \u201cThis is a fantastic solution for smaller hotels or individual properties to be part of ibtm world, we have had lots of requests and feel that this is the best stress-free alternative.\u00a0\u00a0 We have created maximum return, the opportunity to showcase their property in a dedicated area ensuring Hosted Buyers and Trade Visitors can easily locate them on the show floor. This area has been specifically created to meet the demands of the Hosted Buyers and Trade Visitors attending the show who want to see new and different hotel properties \u201d. Each exhibitor will have a stress free experience whilst still getting the opportunity to have a full diary of appointments and of course the brand awareness to the trade visitor audience.\u201d\n\n\nHotels wishing to take advantage of the Hotel Pavilion should visit the ibtm world website www.ibtmworld.com\/hotelpavilion \u00a0\n\n\nWe use cookies to operate this website and to improve its usability.

        "text":"Rockford Chamber VOICE Article, April 1, 2017\nTournaments and Events Help Keep the Economy Humming\nBy John Groh\n\nThe value of tourism to a community can sometimes be hard to grasp if you are just looking at the big picture. What I mean by that is it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the numbers \u2013 many of which are large-scale such as the $350 million visitors spent in Winnebago County in 2015, or the 7.6 million people that attended our sites, attractions and events that same year.\n\nThe community-wide impact is certainly represented in numbers like these. However, it\u2019s tourism on the smaller scale that really showcases the impact on the community. Take for instance the U.S. Synchronized Skating Championships held at the BMO Harris Bank Center in February. Bringing in teams from throughout the United States, we had the opportunity to showcase our wonderful community to thousands of visitors.\n\nAnd, we definitely did put our best foot forward \u2026 Check out this great review from the Starlights Synchronized Skating Club from Skokie, Illinois:\n\n\u201cThank you Go Rockford. The 2017 U.S. Synchronized Skating Championships was successful because of you. Your whole team supported us from the time we started planning the event through the event itself. The city of Rockford welcomed the skaters and their families with open arms, and a very large pair of skates! Your restaurants and hotels made all of the skaters feel welcome and special. Everywhere you looked, we were the talk of the town. We couldn't have done it without you and we hope we have an opportunity to host another event in Rockford.\u201d\n\nEven more important than the glowing review might be the fact that our hotels, restaurants and retail establishments got a nice shot in the arm during the slow winter months. The District Bar & Grill downtown reported having fulfilled more than 700 reservations the week of the event from participants, and another downtown business said that the Friday and Saturday of the event saw sales equal to what they usually see in the entire month of February. And it wasn\u2019t just downtown business; Lucha Cantina also reported having one of their busiest weekends in the past year.\n\nSo it\u2019s the impact of each tournament over the course of the year that leads us to these mega-watt numbers that fuel our economy. Better yet, these mega-watt numbers lead to more jobs as our hospitality industry continues to grow with more than 2,800 jobs directly related to the tourism industry in Rockford!\n\nSo what\u2019s next for Rockford?\n\nThe past few months have been very busy for the RACVB as we have announced several high profile, high attendance tournaments and conferences that are coming to our region this year. Here\u2019s a quick sample of what we can look forward to:\n\n- Amateur Athletic Union Midwest Regional Gymnastics Championships\nDate: May 5-7, 2017 Location: UW Health Sports Factory Attendance: 400-500 athletes traveling from across the region and 1,500 total visitors expected. Economic Impact: Estimated 485 room nights and $87,300 in economic impact.\n- Premier SuperCopa Championships\nDate: June 9-12, 2017 Location: Mercyhealth Sportscore Two Attendance: 92 boys teams, 64 girls teams; U9-U12 for both genders, national tournament (invitation only) and 6,000 total visitors expected Economic Impact: Estimated 10,000 room nights and $1.8 million in economic impact\n- Elite Clubs National Playoffs\nDate: June 22-27, 2017 Location: Mercyhealth Sportscore Two Attendance: Approximately 240 teams, all girls competitive youth leagues ages 14-18 and 10,000 total visitors expected. Economic Impact: Estimated 14,000 room nights and $2,520,000 EEI (Teams will stay in the Rockford region and extend into Chicago, Milwaukee and possibly Madison.)\n- Convention of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\nDate: July 28-30, August 4-6 and August 11-13 Location: BMO Harris Bank Center Attendance: This big win for the Rockford region will draw approximately 15,000 attendees who are expected to visit from Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Davenport, Kenosha, Racine and more.\nEconomic Impact: Estimated $589,500 and more than 4,500 room nights during the three weekends.\n\nThe impact of these events will be a tremendous boost to our local economy this year and we are thankful that these groups have chosen Rockford. Thanks to great cooperation from our local partners like the Rockford Park District, BMO Harris Bank Center and many others, we are able to continue securing events like these for the region. And, the great customer service our hotels, restaurants and retail businesses show these guests keeps them wanting to come back time and time again.",

The objectives of the meeting are to further educate tourism stakeholders on the Zika virus and to encourage stakeholders to take preventive measures to mitigate the spread of Zika.\n\nMinister of Tourism Obie Wilchcombe said the ministry continues to be proactive in the fight against the virus.\n\n\u201cThe primary focus of our meeting on Monday is to discuss precautions that we can take to combat the Zika virus and ensure that our visitors have a safe and healthy experience in our islands,\u201d Wilchcombe said.\n\n\u201cThe Bahamas remains a safe destination and we will continue to be. We have a lot of confidence in the work the Ministry of Health is doing to manage Zika and mitigate further cases.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Health Ministry Dr. Perry Gomez said that there are now eight confirmed cases of Zika on the island of New Providence.\n\nHealth officials continue to fog on New Providence and the family of islands.\n\nThe Zika virus is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. However, the virus is also spread from mother to baby during pregnancy and during sexual intercourse.\n\nHealth Officials advise anyone travelling to The Bahamas who feel they may have symptoms of the virus to contact the National Disease Surveillance Unit at 502-4776, 502-4790, 376-3809 or 376-4705.\n\nVisitors to The Bahamas receive educational pamphlets about the virus at all ports of entry. The pamphlet includes symptoms, prevention tips and contact information for the Ministry of Health.\n\nHotels and guest properties throughout The Islands of The Bahamas are also continuing their proactive measures.\n\nProactive measures include:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Providing staff and guests with information on Zika so that they are aware of the signs and symptoms, how Zika is transmitted and how it can be prevented.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Having insect repellant available to visitors.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Avoiding storing water in outdoor containers to prevent them from becoming mosquito-breeding sites.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Covering water tanks or reservoirs so that mosquitoes do not get in.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Avoiding the build-up of garbage, which can act as a breeding site for mosquitoes. Putting garbage in closed plastic bags and keep it in closed containers.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Uncovering and unblocking gutters and drains to release stagnant water.\n\nAll travelers are advised to:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Stay informed about the Zika situation in countries they are travelling to.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Use insect repellents on exposed skin. Insect repellents that contain DEET, Picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or IR3535 are the most effective and safe when used according to the label. If also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and insect repellent second.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Where possible, wear light colored long-sleeved shirts and long pants, socks and shoes to minimize exposed skin.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0When indoors use air conditioning and keep the doors and windows closed, unless they are screened, to keep out mosquitoes. If this is not possible, sleep under mosquito nets to prevent bites.\n\nWhat should you do if you feel sick and think you may have Zika?\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Consult a healthcare professional if you are feeling ill, especially if you have a fever. If you have returned home, make sure to tell them about your travel.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Use acetaminophen or paracetamol to treat fever and pain.\n\nGet lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A person infected with Zika will have the virus in their blood for the first week of infection. The virus can be passed on to other mosquitoes if they bite you while you are carrying the virus. Therefore, be especially careful to prevent mosquito bites during the first week to avoid spreading the disease.\n\nTravelers are encouraged to visit Bahamas.com\/pressroom for any updates on Zika.\n\nComment on this Article:\n\nTime limit is exhausted.

Though these events are the first impression a lot f people get of the downtown, their purpose lies deeper than providing a fun afternoon.\n\nOn average, the events held in West Allis Downtown bring 20,000 people to the area annually. The West Allis A La Carte and the Downtown West Allis Classic Car Show combined brought over 5,000 visitors from outside of Milwaukee County. The more out of town visitors an event brings in, the more new potential customers for our businesses in the Downtown or who are vending at the event. Out of town visitors also have a higher chance of spending the night at one of our hotels, increasing the amount of room tax dollars coming in to be used to promote more tourism to the city.\n\nThanks to Errin Welty and Adriana Saia from the Wisconsin Main Street Program, we were able to get a comprehensive report on specifically how our 2019 Downtown West Allis Classic Car Show impacted the community. The report outlined where people came from, how old they were.how they found out about the event, and how much money they spent during the day.\n\n60% of the people who attended this year's show spent less than $25 at the event; where as guests between the ages of 36 and 45 spent larger amounts of money at the show.
