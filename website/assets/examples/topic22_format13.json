        "text":"Cable Preservation Project Set for the Delaware Memorial Bridge\nInstallation Work Expected through December 2017\n\n(New Castle, DE) Today, Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) officials announced the award of a contract to preserve and protect its principal asset, the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Under the new contract, the DRBA will install a dehumidification system for the main suspension cables on both structures of the Delaware Memorial Bridge. The work is expected to begin at the end of February, 2016 and continue for nearly two years.\n\nThe Delaware Memorial Bridge is a major transportation link in the north-south corridor between Washington, D.C. and New York City that handles more than 34 million vehicles annually. The Delaware Memorial Bridges main suspension cables are original to each bridge. The New Jersey bound span opened in 1951 while the Delaware bound one was completed in 1968.\n\nAccording to Shoukry Elnahal, Chief Engineer for the DRBA, the new dehumidification system is part of the Authority\u2019s comprehensive capital program designed to preserve and protect the bi-state agency\u2019s transportation infrastructure. \u201cThis state-of-the-art system will extend the life span of our main suspension cables that support the bridge deck of the Delaware Memorial Bridges,\u201d Elnahal said. \u201cThe project involves the fitting of air tight wraps around the main cables, positioning injection and exhaust ports, and installing advanced dehumidification plants inside the anchorages of the two bridges.\u201d\n\nElnahal also noted that the system will be equipped with remote sensors and advanced monitoring systems to insure it is functioning as intended. \u201cThe new dehumidification system is designed to operate as efficiently as possible while keeping the Authority\u2019s long term maintenance requirements to a minimum,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the execution of this contract, multiple lanes on the northbound and the southbound bridges will be closed periodically. While DRBA engineers have designed the project to minimize traffic delays to the extent possible, motorists should expect to experience them from time-to-time.\n\nThe safety of the traveling public, highway contractors on-site, and DRBA employees continue to be the highest priority. Commuters and travelers are urged to be careful and stay alert in and around construction zones, obey all detours and posted speed limits and plan to take a few extra minutes during rush hour periods.\n\nApproximately 25 suspension bridges in the world are equipped with a cable dehumidification system. In 1998, the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan was the first to be equipped with such a system. The Maryland Transportation Authority began installing the first cable dehumidification system in the United States for the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial (Bay) Bridge in 2012. That system was completed last year. The Delaware Memorial Bridge Twin Span will be the second such application in the United States.\n\nAmerican Bridge Company of Coraopolis, Pennsylvania will handle the construction and installation work at a cost of $33.6 million. Formed in 1900, American Bridge Company is a leading provider of bridge construction services worldwide. The company excels at the construction and rehabilitation of cable supported bridges, movable bridges, steel truss bridges, steel and concrete arch bridges, and other complex civil infrastructure projects that benefit from advanced construction engineering skills.\n\nAbout the Delaware River and Bay Authority\nThe DRBA, a bi-state governmental agency created by Compact in 1962, owns and operates the Delaware Memorial Bridge, the Cape May- Lewes Ferry, and the Forts Ferry Crossing. The DRBA also manages corporate and aviation properties through its economic development powers - two airports in New Jersey (Millville Airport and Cape May Airport) and three in Delaware (New Castle Airport, Civil Air Terminal and Delaware Airpark). All DRBA operating revenues are generated through the bridge, ferry and airport facilities. For more information, visit\n\nPDF of Press Release\n\nDMB Tower Aerial",

        "text":"Consumers for\nReliability and\n\nCFA Award\n\nAt an annual awards event in Washington, D.C. June 16, 2004, the Consumer Federation of America presented the Esther Peterson Consumer Service Award to the National Consumer Law Center of Boston, MA, and to Rosemary Shahan, President of CARS. This prestigious award is widely recognized as the top award in the consumer movement.\n\nOther award recipients were New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer (Philip Hart Public Service Award), United States Representative Charles Rangel (Philip Hart Public Service Award) and David Fanning, Senior Producer of PBS' Frontline (Betty Furness Consumer Media Award).\n\nThe Consumer Federation of America stated in its brochure about the awards event:\n\nRosemary Shahan is [one of the] nation's leading advocates for vehicle safety and fair treatment of consumers at car dealerships. As President of California-based CARS, and founder of Motor Voters, Rosemary has invested twenty-five years of passion, hard work, and advocacy in making an immeasurable difference in safety and consumer rights and protections. She initiated California\u2019s auto \u2018lemon law\u2019 to make manufacturers stand behind defective vehicles, leading to similar laws in all fifty states.\n\nHer campaign for airbags covered all fronts, including lobbying Lee Iacocca to switch from opposing to supporting air bags. Her picket of one manufacturer for its low-ranked safety record led to a safety recall. Rosemary has been in the thick of fights ranging from stopping gag orders in lemon law case settlements, a media campaign to press for recall of \u201cfirebomb\u201d pickups, exposure of \u201clemon laundering\u201d of defective autos to unsuspecting used car buyers, and stopping a Senate attempt to preempt state auto salvage fraud laws.\n\nHer most recent campaign is to win a Car Buyer\u2019s Bill of Rights in California. As a consumer advocate who has single-handedly tackled widespread consumer abuses and frequently stopped them, Rosemary is especially deserving of the Esther Peterson Consumer Service Award.\n\nThe Consumer Federation of America, founded in 1968, is a national non-profit federation of more than 260 organizations from throughout the nation with a combined membership exceeding 50 million people. Rosemary has been elected to a third three-year term on the Board of Directors of CFA, where she has served as co-chair of CFA\u2019s Committee on Housing and Transportation for over a decade.\ntext resize Decrease Font Size Increase Font Size\n\nC.A.R.S.
