        "text":"What to Do If Online Dating Isn\u2019t Working\n\nIf you want online dating to start working for (and not against) you, all I can say is \u201cListen up, people!\u201d\n\nAs a matchmaker, 99% of the people I have talked to have already tried online dating. Some for two weeks; others for a few years off and on. But, if someone hasn\u2019t done it yet, I will (normally) tell them to go do it and come back to me then and only then.\n\nWhy, you ask?\u00a0Because almost everyone has unrealistic expectations at the beginning! Before I can do my job successfully, you first need to be schooled in the art of Internet dating.\n\nFor instance, at the start, some (okay most) women \u201crequire\u201d a man within her \u201cfour-year dating range\u201d; they want him \u201cto earn over six figures\u201d and stand \u201cover six feet\u201d tall; the list of \u201cdemands\u201d goes on! After she\u2019s spent a year of dating online, she\u2019ll be thrilled with someone who is \u201cwithin 10 years,\u201d \u201chas a job any job,\u201d and now he only has to be \u201cthree inches taller\u201d than her.\n\nConversely, men start out looking for tens. Let them face the harsh reality of how flakey hot girls can be. After a year of online dating, he\u2019s seeking a woman who has a real job and spends less time looking in the mirror and more time looking at him.\n\nSince you\u2019re busy, I\u2019m busy, we\u2019re all busy, I\u2019m cutting right to the chase \u2013 pun absolutely intended!\n\nDear Women,\n\nIf online dating isn\u2019t working for you, it\u2019s most likely due to your pictures. I cannot stress this enough \u2013 but I\u2019ll try \u2013 what you think is cute is probably anything but. Get some input from friends, or be bold (wine helps), and ask the men around you what they think.\n\nGood photos to include are:\n\nOnes showing you laughing because (most) men are attracted to happy women. Others can show you smiling \u2013 genuinely \u2013 and not looking too seriously serious. Another picture needs to show you all dressed up and out on the town. Show off your style, hobbies and interests, and, most of all, your face. Maybe one of you all dressed up, drinking wine with friends in an upscale bar or restaurant; another from a hike; and yet another from that boat ride or soaking up rays at the beach.\n\nBad photos to keep off your profile include:\n\nSelfies which, in general, are sad \u2013 and selfies of you taking a body shot in the bathroom are way worse. Skip making kissy or pouty lips. You may think it\u2019s funny, but in your online profile, you\u2019ll just seem weird. Don\u2019t be that woman who\u2019s acting 13 years old and making duck faces.\n\nProfile tips to remember:\n\nWhile we\u2019re dissecting your photo array, let\u2019s take a paragraph to talk about your bio. It\u2019s important to strike a balance between not being too plain jane (literally!) and sounding annoying. Start by sharing a few sentences about what\u2019s most important to you; and toss in a few of the traits you\u2019re looking for in a man. Be sure to be brief, cute but not cutesy, girly but not childish, and \u2013 throughout \u2013 keep it upbeat! (But, be very careful not to overuse exclamation points!!!!!)\n\n\nIf online dating isn\u2019t working for you, it\u2019s also most likely due to your pictures.\n\nTypes of photos to include:\n\nA nice picture with your mom or grandmother can make you look cute while still projecting a trustworthy vibe. Showing off your style is a good idea \u2013 whether in a business suit, casual outfit, or at a concert or tailgating party. Keep a masculine stance, one that\u2019s not too macho. Ask a female friend to help you pick from existing photos or snap a few new ones of you with your friends, perhaps while getting a drink after work.\n\nTypes of photos to leave off:\n\nSelfies may have their time and place \u2013 but, on your online profile, it\u2019s just going to make you look weird. Or narcissistic. Or narcissistically weird. A woman browsing online profiles might think you don\u2019t have any friends. Bathroom shots are creepy, as well as gym shots with your muscles all out and a sweaty tank. No matter how good you look without a shirt on, when it comes to your online profile, being topless is too much information. And leave off any photos with your legs crossed. What may seem normal in real life may come across as too effeminate on your profile.\n\nAll in all, we know that women are just looking for normalcy because professional-looking men get more swipes than guys taking selfies in their cars.\n\nKeep in mind that matchmakers and dating services are only able to do some of the work for you. But, since another part of our job is to provide no-holds-barred reality checks, here are some parting words:\n\nMen: If those hot girls aren\u2019t emailing you back, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t find you attractive; it\u2019s not because they didn\u2019t get your email. Or maybe they were not impressed that you only wrote \u201cHey.\u201d You need to focus on giving off a masculine vibe, by asking questions that prove you went beyond just her photos and actually read her bio. The more interested you sound in her and her life, the more likely she is to send a meaningful response.\n\nWomen: Same advice. When men don\u2019t email you back, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t find you attractive. The faster you realize they just aren\u2019t into you and move on, the better.\n\nTo all: You have to find a way to meet singles face to face. Get out and about on the weekends to bars, restaurants, and outdoor and cultural activities; and become involved with at least one singles group or matchmaking company.\n\nComments are closed here.",

        "text":"Social Media and the Modern Wedding\n\nIn-the-know mothers of the bride (MOBs) realize that the era of social media means their daughters are planning, deciding and sharing wedding plans in ways that may be new (and a perhaps bit intimidating) to them. Today, more than 80% of modern brides make a majority of their weddings decisions online!\n\nAs MOBs who support their daughter-brides it\u2019s important for MOBs to embrace modern media and share this experience with your daughter. Social media, wedding apps and wedding blogs are a great way to foster great communication as you enjoy this time together.\n\nConsider this your crash course in how to use the best-of social media to enjoy the wedding festivities, and when you and your daughter may want to sign-off.\n\nLet\u2019s Chat!\n\nAsk you daughter which apps she is using to plan her wedding day. Have her help you download her favorite apps, or invite you to collaborate with or follow her on social media platforms like Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram. MOBs can share and support wedding planning together, whether she lives around the corner or too many miles away.\n\nDoes she use an online wedding platform like Ask her or a sibling to walk you through the site and show you her plans, online registry, guest list and other important planning information.\n\nIt\u2019s ok to have a conversation about what is appropriate to share on the web through her wedding planning process, and those things that are perhaps best handled offline, like conversations about money\/budget.\n\n#hashtag & headline\n\nYour daughter will likely create a fun, personalized hashtag to identify and tag everything she is posting on the web about her wedding day. These can be more general (#misstomrs) or can encorporate the couple\u2019s names\/unique details. Learn what it is and how to use it to track along!\n\nGet Inspired!\n\nUse the internet yourself to research just about anything a MOB might need to know, regarding bridal etiquette, family traditions or scan and search for the latest fashion wedding trends! This gives MOBs fresh insights to share with and connect to their daughter brides on all things bridal as they plan her special day together.\n\nFeeling Overwhelmed? Pick Pinterest!\n\nMOBS can get practice on social media on Pinterest and start learning with an easy fun social platform that is especially easy for MOBs on the go. This resource basically functions like a virtual bulletin board while also pulling in relevant ideas\/inspiration a user may be interested in saving for later. \u00a0Enter your email address at and you will be up and pinning photo ideas before you know it!\n\nFor a great place to get started, check the Unbox the Dress Pinterest page with boards filled with lots of classic wedding beauty, gorgeous gowns and lots of mother-daughter love!\n\nFacebook Frenzy\n\nFacebook is a wonderful way to engage family and friends across the country and share excitement of the wedding days ahead. Just be careful that broad sharing of information may create expectations for being included in events. For smaller intimate weddings, this can pose challenges and risk hurting feelings. Discuss with your daughter how she wants to share in plans and photos across Facebook early to make sure you are aligned.\n\nGoogle Photos\n\nThis application functions like a free, private, virtual photo album. The \u201cowner\u201d of the album simply sets it up and gives it a title \u2013 and then can invite other contributors\/viewers via phone number or email. Once invited, other family members or friends can add their own photos to the album, making it a great way to collect up and share the best-of candid photos for all kinds of wedding events.\n\nSilence Please!\n\nIt is perfectly acceptable to hit the pause button during the actual wedding ceremony to preserve the intimacy of the moment; ask guests to silence their phones during the wedding with a pretty sign or in the program, or have the wedding officiant make an announcement at the beginning of the ceremony. With professional photographers and video-graphers there to capture the moment professionally this allows the guests to focus on the bride, the groom and people in the room for a once in a lifetime moment!\n\nWe love seeing the professional photographs of our real brides wearing the accessories remade from their mother\u2019s wedding gowns. Check out Chelsea wearing our Bridal Veil\n\nMOBs can set the standard with gracious social media behavior before, during and after the wedding in the ways that work for her family and the bride to be!\n\nThe cookie settings on this website are set to 'allow all cookies' to give you the very best experience.

What fun!\n\nIt's best to be organized and as relaxed as you can. First, decide on the date, location, and budget. Keep the party short--an hour and a half to two hours is long enough for this age--and limit the number of guests. Three to five children are plenty.\n\nAway from Home\nA party outside the house eliminates a lot of mess. Make sure the establishment can accommodate very young children and their parents--at this age most children insist that their parents stay with them.\n\nAt Home\nParties at home are exciting for the child. He or she can help decorate and prepare. If the weather permits, have the party outside.\n\nExtra Help\nConsider hiring someone to help out, such as a favorite cousin or neighbor who can set up games and serve food. Very young children need constant attention and help. Book this helper a month in advance and make sure he or she arrives well before and stays well after the party. Go to FamilyTime Calendar .\n\nWith their short attention spans, young children need only one or two activities. Fill up the remaining time with food and free play.\n\n  \u2022 Musical chairs, duck-duck-goose, and simple relay races.\n  \u2022 Read a story or two (the birthday boy's or girl's favorite).\n  \u2022 Hire a magician or clown. Ask him to keep the show short and simple. Some young children are afraid of clowns--find out if this might be an issue.\n  \u2022 A simple treasure hunt or candy hunt (similar to an Easter egg hunt).\n\nIf you want to serve lunch, stick with small, plain sandwiches--jelly, chicken salad, tuna, pizza, or chicken nuggets. Buy or bake a cake and have no more than two ice cream flavors to choose from. Serve the meal halfway through the party to give the children a rest and provide focus. Go to FamilyTime Recipes.\n\nMatching, colorful paper products dress up the table and make cleanup a snap. Use plastic spoons and forks. Have plenty of paper towels on hand for spills. Fill paper cups only halfway with juice or soda. Lay a plastic mat under the table for easy cleanup.\n\nFill \"goodie bags\" with sturdy plastic toys, stickers, and a few pieces of candy. Very small objects, balloons, and chewing gum can be choking hazards.\n\nEnter your email address to receive delicious, family-friendly recipes, exciting promotions, helpful articles and more delivered right to your mailbox.

        "text":"Edit Article\n\nEdited by Lucky7, BR, Barbaroo, Stickman3000 and 26 others\n\nTwo Parts:Working Up the Nerve to CallGetting Through a Phone Conversation Stress-Free\n\nTalking to a girl on the phone can be nerve-racking, especially if she's someone you've got \"a thing\" for! Not to worry - girls are human beings too, and, with the right attitude, you can have a great time talking to them on the phone. Whether you plan on talking to your secret crush or just a friend, knowing how to talk to girls on the phone is a skill that will be useful for the rest of your life. See Step 1 below to get started!\n\n\nPart 1 of 2: Working Up the Nerve to Call\n\n  1. Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 1.jpg\n    Make sure you have a reason to call. Nothing's worse that having to fumble for a sense of purpose while you're on the phone with a girl - figure out why you're calling before you even pick up the receiver. You may already have some reason to call - if so, go with this. Don't lie about your reason for calling to seem cooler.\n    \u2022 If, on the other hand, you don't have a compelling reason to call, give yourself one. For example, ask for help on a homework assignment or an upcoming project.\n  2. Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 3.jpg\n    Have a few ideas of what to talk about beforehand. Most conversations never go according to plan, so you won't, for instance, want to write up a long list of questions to ask. If you do, you'll probably end up trying to \"force\" these things into the conversation, leading to an awkward, stilted call. Just make sure you know the general things you'll need to discuss beforehand - key details you might need to mention, questions you might need to ask, and so on.\n    \u2022 For example, if you want to ask this girl to the movies, you should know to ask where you're going to meet, at what time, and what you're going to see. This loose outline of the conversation should be all you'll need, though it's a good idea to be open to other topics of conversation if they arise.\n  3. 3\n    Try to mentally downplay the importance of the conversation. Take deep breaths. As impossible as it may seem, try to relax. A little more that half of the entire population of planet Earth is female - millions upon millions of boys talk to girls on the phone every day. You can do it too. You have nothing to worry about. When you think you're ready, take just a few moments to \"cool down\", then pick up the phone.\n    \u2022 Truthfully, even if you're asking a girl out, there's not much at stake here, so try not to get too nervous. The absolute worst you'll get is a \"no\". If you're not asking a girl out and just need to talk to her for some other reason (like school or work), you have nothing at all to worry about.\n  4. 4\n    Call without hesitation. The longer you wait to call, the longer you have to think about every possible way your call might go wrong. If you're nervous, don't give yourself the chance to psych yourself out. As soon as you figure out your game plan, pick up the phone and dial the girl's number - try not to think about it as you're doing it.\n    \u2022 Believe it or not, past a certain point, thinking about the conversation you're about to have can be counterproductive. So just get to it! You'll sound more relaxed and natural on the phone if you haven't just agonized over every possible outcome the conversation might have.\n\nPart 2 of 2: Getting Through a Phone Conversation Stress-Free\n\n  1. Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 2.jpg\n    Greet her warmly. When the girl you're calling picks up (or gets passed the phone), say hello, introduce yourself, and say why you're calling. Be friendly at this point - you have nothing to lose by doing so. If she reciprocates your friendliness, keep it up!\n    \u2022 If this is someone you know, it's usually also acceptable to ask her how her day was at the beginning of the conversation.\n  2. 2\n    Get to the point. You usually won't want to dally too long with small talk at the beginning of a phone conversation - this can get old fairly fast and backfire on you, leaving her confused as to why you're actually calling. After your initial pleasantries, get down to business - explain why you called and, if necessary, ask her any pertinent questions that are needed to make the phone call a success.\n    \u2022 For instance, if you're asking her to the movies, you'll want to get this out of the way fairly quickly. If you chat for half an hour and only then ask her, she may get the impression that you're only asking her as an after thought. When you call, say hi, ask how she's doing, and, if the opportunity presents itself, talk for a little bit about something that's mutually interesting, but try to ask her within the first few minutes.\n  3. Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 4.jpg\n    Stay calm. Some girls may find it cute when a boy gets nervous and flustered on the phone, but you may not want to count on this, because other girls, who aren't great at judging people's emotions over the phone, may get frustrated or feel that you're wasting their time. Try to talk slowly and calmly - don't rush your words.\n    \u2022 Remember, the girl you're talking to is a human being. For all you know, she may be just as nervous of talking on the phone as you are. Never assume the girl you're talking to is some sort of perfect conversationalist and that if you're not \"good enough\" on the phone, you'll somehow offend her. Just do your best! Any reasonable girl will meet you halfway.\n  4. Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 5.jpg\n    Listen. Conversations are two-way interactions - the way you don't talk is just as important as the way you talk. Give the girl you're talking to plenty of chances to speak - don't just talk non-stop the entire conversation. When she speaks, listen. Generally, you shouldn't interrupt her while she talks, though, if she goes on for a while, you can show you're still listening by saying \"yeah?\", \"uh huh?\", and so on as she talks.\n    \u2022 Another great way to show you're listening is to repeat back things that your conversation partner just said in the form of a question. For example, if she says \"I don't like the substitute teacher. He smells like moth balls\", you can say \"He smells like moth balls?\" to show you're listening and to give her an opportunity to keep talking.\n  5. Talk to a Girl over the Phone Step 6.jpg\n    If you get the chance to chat, ask lots of questions. Though every girl is different, as a general rule, most people like to talk about themselves. So, if your conversation naturally continues after you've gotten your business out of the way, feel free to keep talking. If you hit a lull, ask questions to jump start the conversation.\n  6. 6\n    End the call gracefully. When you reach a lull in the conversation and you don't have anything to say, it's perfectly acceptable to end the call - don't feel like you have to keep it going any longer than feels natural. Simply say something to the effect of \"Well, I should probably go - I have things to do. This has been fun talking to you\", give her a chance to respond, say your goodbyes, and hang up. That's it - you've just survived a phone call with a girl!\nAdd your own method\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Listen to what she has to say.\n  \u2022 Be funny. Just try to find aspects of stuff that's funny and say it. You can tease her, but know there is a certain limit.\n  \u2022 Speak clearly and slowly.\n  \u2022 Don't ask too many questions, but don't ask too little questions either.\n\n\n  \u2022 Never be mean or rude.\n\nThings You'll Need\n\n  \u2022 a phone\n  \u2022 conversation starters\n\nArticle Info\n\nCategories: Phone Skills\n\nRecent edits by: Karen, WanderWoman, Joe Forte\n\nIn other languages:\n\nEspa\u00f1ol:\u00a0C\u00f3mo hablar por tel\u00e9fono con una chica,\u00a0Italiano:\u00a0Come Parlare al Telefono con una Ragazza,\u00a0Portugu\u00eas:\u00a0Como Falar com uma Garota pelo Telefone\n\n\nThanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 211,623 times.\n\nDid this article help you?\n\n\nan Author!\n\nWrite an Article",

        "text":"Productive Communications\n\nby Harlee Abromson, LCSW, Director\n\nWhen I ask couples why they\u2019ve decided to seek counseling, the frequent reply is \u201ccommunication!\"\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that needs to happen to get two people into a happier state. The purpose of this article is to touch upon some basic guidelines for arguing in order to illustrate certain communication techniques that improve relationships.\n\nMost people in relationships argue. Sometimes people don't know how to argue productively. Past family traumas or poor relationship role models may have exposed us only to all-or-nothing explosive anger or a tuning out that represses feelings. But these aren't the only options. Take a look at the following techniques and see if you have room to make some changes in how you're communicating with your partner.\n\n1. Use \"I\" statements to express how you feel while avoiding assaultive \u201cyou\" statements and blaming.\n\nInstead of assaulting with an accusation or blame, you might get a better result by saying how an offending action makes you feel. \"I\" statements that remove the assault, without the need to name-call, can open a seemingly blind eye. Perhaps your mate didn't realize how some prior action made you feel. When your perception is shared with authenticity, dignity and respect, your partner will see much more of the bigger picture. The new knowing can be the catalyst for true change and cooperation.\n\n2. Don't make assumptions about what your partner thinks and feels. Clarify.\n\nIt's better to ask what your partner is thinking or feeling rather than assuming. Assuming can exacerbate misunderstandings and produce a destructive pattern of blame, suppression and anger. Remember that your partner is not a mind-reader. You are responsible for expressing your thoughts and feelings, too. There are so many wrong decisions made and so much unnecessary hurt from making assumptions. By setting aside any assumptions and making the choice to clarify each other\u2019s thoughts with one another, a couple matures and achieves understanding; with understanding, good decisions are made and feelings toward each other become increasingly positive.\n\n3. De-escalate overheating arguments.\n\nPausing to recess can be a kind and responsible act. This is not avoidance or dismissal, but a precautionary measure that acknowledges too much anger is preventing rational resolution. Remember to tell your partner four things: how you're feeling using \"I\" statements, where you're going, how long you will be gone and that you do want to resolve the issue. Tell your partner that you are afraid you might say or do something you regret. After a short break, such as a walk, you can revisit the issue\n\nThis is different than walking away while fueled by anger, which is the height of rejection and will only serve to cause further hurt. These four keys let your partner know you still care, even while angry and in need of space for the moment.\n\n4. When arguing, stay in the context of the topic rather than the past.\n\nWhen couples are arguing about going or not going to the in-laws for Sunday dinner, for example, it's important to stay within the context of the discussion. Separate unresolved past issues should be addressed at other times. If too often too many unresolved past issues invade each argument, realize this may be a sign to seek counseling to work through those accumulated issues.\n\n5. You can communicate without words through nonviolent acts of care.\n\nIt's not always necessary to use words when communicating. Sometimes just a touch, hug or smile is all your partner needs to know you care when the day has been hard or a challenge looms ahead. A simple gesture, like bringing your partner a cup of coffee in the morning, is still communication.\n\n6. Give reassurance.\n\nEven when you're not getting along, you\u2019ll go a long way to tell your partner you realize this moment is difficult, but you want to get through it and that it all will be ok.\n\n7. Make time to talk.\n\nEveryone is so busy with work, or finding work, or friends or family. Sometimes we forget the priority of the relationship. It's a good idea to set aside time on a regular basis to check in, clarify, reassure, plan. Constructive talking, after all, prevent arguments in the first place. It's so important to nurture your relationship, even in the midst of everyday obligations. Making your relationship central to the rest of your life provides security, stability and the love we all need to launch into our days happily and energetically.\n\nIf physical abuse is present in your relationship the time has come to take precautions. Although we may be dedicated deeply to someone, an argument should never become physical or involve the destruction of property. Should this be happening, please realize these steps may not be enough. Please call for help or immediately seek professional counseling.\n\nCommunication provides a bridge where couples meet to make their journey together more meaningful. It is the basis for all understanding and interaction. It is the cognitive component necessary for success. Even an argument can become productive if it restores and grows the communication in a relationship.\n\nWith motivation and commitment, healthy communication is not only possible, but can become a very natural way of interacting on a daily basis. It's a whole lot of fun, too.\n\nEmail Contact Harlee Abromson\n\n  \u2022 Address\n\n    1201 South Braddock Avenue, Suite 2, Pittsburgh, PA 15218\n  \u2022 Phone",

        "text":"What's the best sound setup for my Morton Arboretum wedding ceremony?\n\nMy teams play music at Morton Arbretum wedding ceremonies a LOT. In the height of the Chicago season, it seems like hardly a week goes by without at least one Backthird DJ, jazz group or string ensemble setting up there. And yet one thing we love about Arboretum weddings is that, if you get married there, your event won't unfold quite like anyone else's. The sheer number of spaces and the many ways to use them ensures that every couple's night takes a very personal shape.\n\nCouples saying\u00a0vows\u00a0at Morton Arboretum have a lot of gardens, lawns and rooms to choose from. It's no wonder, then, that one of the biggest questions Backthird office staff get is \"What kind of sound setup does my wedding ceremony need?\"\n\nWhat follows is our specific advice for various Morton Arboretum wedding ceremony spaces. In every case, the goal is the same: To allow all of your guests to hear all of your ceremony without difficulty. For some areas, that means microphones are a must - in others, you could skip the sound setup and go entirely acoustic if your guest list is small.You can check out my general advice on ceremony sound in this post. Here's how it breaks down for Arboretum ceremonies.\n\nSee our Arboretum wedding packages and pricing.\n\nArboretum_sound_-_body-500008-edited.pngCeremonies near the Visitor Center\n\nThe Visitor Center is where The Ginkgo Room and Orientation Hall, Morton Arboretum's largest reception spaces, can be found. If your guest list is much larger than 150, you're probably planning to party in and around these spaces.\n\nThe Hedge Garden is a wonderful space for a wedding ceremony - just a short walk from the Visitor Center, it's easy to access but the high hedges all around give a sense of quiet seclusion. You'll definitely want microphones for your officiant and other speakers for this large space - we often send Backthird sound engineers with two speakers, so they can spread them along the side of the space to help everyone hear clearly without cranking the volume too high. It's easy to tuck equipment behind a hedge, so no sound gear shows up in your photos.\n\nThere's not a ton of shade in the Hedge Garden, so your guests will need to be willing to walk a short distance and catch a few rays. We've actually seen clever couples integrate fans or bug repellant into their decor with charming results.\n\nThe Ginkgo Room and the Sycamore Room are nearby - if you've booked your reception in one of these rooms, your reception space will also double as a rain or cold-weather location for your Arboretum\u00a0ceremony. We've seen some beautiful ceremonies in these spaces, which both offer great views of the Morton grounds. We recommend a sound system and microphones for both these larger rooms if you want guests to hear your vows well.\n\nFinally, the\u00a0lawn outside the Sycamore Room is a lovely space for outdoor events as well. You'll definitely want a sound system here, even for a smaller ceremony, since the space is very open. Unamplified voices will disappear in the open air, leaving guests in the back rows unable to hear what's happening. If you're getting married early on an August afternoon, this lawn may not be the spot for you - there's no shade, and guests in formal clothes will get hot fast.\u00a0\n\nCeremonies near the Thornhill Center\n\nThornhill is the home of the Arbor Room and the Founders Room - charming event spaces where you're more likely to celbrate if your guest list is closer to the 100-person mark. There are also some wonderful outdoor locations nearby.\n\nThe\u00a0Thornhill Lawn, Morton Terrace\u00a0and\u00a0Thornhill patio are all popular spots for an outdoor wedding ceremony. Speakers and microphones are a must at any of these locations unless you're planning a very small ceremony (fewer than 50 guests). As an added note, be aware that while ceremonies on the lawn can be stunning, getting there means a good 100-yard walk down the hill in the grass.\u00a0If mobility is a challenge for some of your guests, consider the more easily accessed patio or terrace first.\n\nphoto by Jolie Images\n\nFinally, the\u00a0Founder's Room is a striking space\u00a0that works for smaller dinners, for dancing - and for wedding ceremonies. And with so much hard wood, stone and glass, the Founder's Room is an acoustic wonder - its reflective character makes violins and cellos resonate beautifully. That also means you should NOT need to use microphones during your ceremony - unless, that is, you're expecting 100 or more guests. (Why? Because human bodies absorb sound - so even in a resonant space like this, we recommend boosting your officiant's volume if your guest list is in the triple digits.)\u00a0\n\nHow well do I have to understand my setup needs?\n\nI hope this article helps clear up some concerns - but you do NOT need to be a sound expert to get married. In fact, you've got better things to do!\n\nAt Backthird, we assign every couple an Account Manager whose job it is to understand the details of your wedding day and put a plan together for you. You tell us what kind of music you're into, and let us worry about the technical requirements. We include them automatically in every quote we write.\n\nMost reputable entertainment companies should work this way - you tell them what you like, and they'll work out on their own the best way to make it happen. Just be aware that locations with more complicated sound needs tend to cost a little more.\n\nHow much more?

        "text":"Choosing your bridesmaids\n\nChoosing your bridesmaids\n\nYou want your nearest and dearest around you on your wedding day and none are dearer than your bridesmaids. In many cases it can be difficult to ensure that you don't upset anyone if you don't ask them to walk down the aisle with you. Some of us have lots of really close friends so picking your bridesmaids is tough. We decided to make your life easier by coming up with a few top tips.\n\nWork out your budget\n\nYour budget comes first. If you can afford to have 4 girls, fire ahead. But if not, then get two- perhaps your sister and closest friend. The bride generally pays for the bridesmaids dresses so if money is an issue you can't have an army of girls with you. Weddings are pricey and if you add 4 or 5 outfits, girls' days out and lunches etc it can cost an extra few thousand euro, which you may not have budgeted for.\n\n\nWhat sort of a role do you want your bridesmaids to play?\n\nBeing a bridesmaid involves helping organise the hen, helping out with the wedding, wedding dress shopping, music, photos, emotional support and more, so its important to pick someone who is geographically nearby. Also pick someone who is available- not someone who lives miles away. That said there's nothing wrong with picking a friend from afar or someone who just had their fourth child to be bridesmaid, but needless to say you can't lumber them with endless tasks.\n\n\nPrepare for a \"no\"\n\nIf your friend says no, don't be offended. There's a chance your friend just has other things going on. Maybe she just broke up with her boyfriend and can't face someone rubbing their joy in her face. Maybe she's having a bad time in work or not enough time to dedicate to your wedding. Though it's the most important occasion to you, for others it can be an inconvenience if they have other things going on in their life. Pick the person who wants it the most and is great at organising things, has good connections and is a good laugh.\n\nImage Credits:\n\nBarbara McCarthy Photography\n\nCreative Wedding Photography\n\nRate this blog entry:\nWedding Invites List.
