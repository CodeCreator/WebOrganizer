In this 3-D Multiplayer \u201cKing-of-the-Hill\u201d game, up to 8 Dragons battle for control of the Isle by wave-riding. King Dragon must defend his position against rival Dragons by generating waves with a magical Taiko drum. Do you have the wave-riding skills to assume King status and defend your throne? Dragon's Isle was made for the 2017 Global Game Jam. I teamed up with seven other people to make a game in 48 hours based on the theme of \"Waves\".\n\nMembers only\n\nYou do not have permission to add the requested media content.
