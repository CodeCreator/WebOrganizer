Check the Applicable Products and Categories section of this article before starting these steps.\n\nThe writing functionality of the stylus (pen) for the Digital Paper System is disabled if the tip is pressed while connecting the USB cable to charge it. To re-enable functionality, reconnect then disconnect the stylus to the USB cable without pressing the tip.\n\nMake sure that your stylus is fully charged for optimal performance. You may experience slowness or lag during handwriting or annotations if it isn't sufficiently charged.\n\n\n  \u2022 Charging time is up to three hours using a USB connection to an active computer or to an AC adapter, such as a smartphone charger.\n  \u2022 The red indicator turns off when the stylus is fully charged.\n  \u2022 The average estimated battery life or usage time is approximately one month (based on writing usage of 60 minutes per day).\n\nOther Things to Check\n\nIf the issue still occurs, additional troubleshooting is available. Check if the stylus works after each step.\n\n  1. Re-calibrate the stylus (pen).\n    1. On your device, press the Home Home button button.\n    2. Tap Settings.\n    3. Tap System Settings.\n    4. Select Pen Calibration.\n      1. Select the variation that most resembles your own grip from the four variations displayed on how to hold the pen, then select Next.\n      2. Use the pen to trace the dotted lines as you would normally write.\n      3. Tap Next.\n      4. Tap the arrows that point up, down, left, and right to move the line that you drew and align it with the dotted line.\n      5. Tap Next when the lines are in basically the same position.\n        \u2022 The confirmation screen is displayed.\n      6. Trace the dotted line again, as you did in step 2.\n        \u2022 If the line that you drew appears displaced, tap Recalibrate to return to the previous screen. The line that you drew on the confirmation screen will be displayed, so correct the placement again, as you did in step 4. After you finish correcting the position, tap Next, and trace the dotted line on the confirmation screen again.\n      7. Tap Save when the dotted line and the line that you drew appear to line up.\n  2. Initialize your device to factory default settings.\n\n    WARNING! All files will be deleted. Back up important data on your computer.\n\n    1. Press the Home Home button button.\n    2. Tap Settings.\n    3. Tap System Settings.\n    4. Tap Initialize Digital Paper.",

        "text":"\u2022 Search\n\nHelp & Guide\n\nWire Material\n\nKanthal, it is the most used wire and most common on all the coils in the market and it can be used on a regular device on regular power or volts mode.\n\n\nNickel (NI200) wire, it's a very low resistance wire and it's resistance varies when you apply current on it making possible to some devices to control temperature just reading those resistance variations and making calculations. This wire CANNOT be used on regular power mode because of it's fumes provenient to the Nickel degradation and that's bad to inhale.\n\n\nNichrome 80 is another wire type that gained popularity with vapers to use for their\u00a0RBA\u00a0coil builds. Although a lot of vapers still swear by it, slowly kanthal is starting to take its place. Nichrome 80 is an alloy of nickel and chromium, it is composed of 80% nickel and 20% chromium.\n\nCompared to kanthal wire, nichrome is much less heat resistant at 2462 degrees Fahrenheit, but it heats up much quicker than kanthal. Because it heats up much faster, nichrome 80 is very popular among sub-ohm cloud chasing vapers.\n\n\nTitanium Wire, works pretty much like the previous one, but it gives you higher resistance then NI200, better ramp up or quick heat and quick cool down, and just like NI200 this wire CANNOT be used on regular power mode because of possible formation of Titanium Dioxide and that's bad to inhale.\n\n\nStainless Steel Wire, on the other hand, can and should be used just as kanthal on regular power mode devices, but with the advantage that it can also be used on temperature control mode on devices that have that function. You can still use it on Titanium temperature control mode on most devices out now but you need to start on the minimum temperature like 200\u00baF (100\u00baC) because the Stainless Steel Wire Temperature Coefficient is low compared to Titanium the temperatures will be that off. Me and also other reviewers and vapers agree that the flavor coming from the vapor produced on a coil with this wire, tastes more clean and crispy.\n\n\nTo conclude, Kanthal has a higher Max Operating Temperature which will give it a longer life on your RDA.\u00a0 Nichrome heats up at a faster rate and is sometimes preferred for this reason for \"cloud chasing\" or sub-ohm builds. Some people taste a difference between Kanthal and Nichrome stating a more metallic taste from the Iron in Kanthal. It depends on your personal sensitivity to metals, and what you like. It is all subjective and really comes down to what you personally like!",
