The bad news is, O\u2019Hare is notorious for delays. But the good news is there are a few key places to go to in each terminal to drink away the wasted time, and maybe even get in one last deep dish pizza and Chicago-style hot dog.\n\nHere are the best places to have a drink in each terminal of the Chicago O\u2019Hare airport.\n\nTerminal 1\n\nBeaudevin Wine Bar: Don\u2019t let a lack of tables fool you; this is a serious wine bar (and not just for an airport). Beaudevin opened in 2012 and has more than 20 wines available by the glass, in addition to a list of small plates, sandwiches, and salads.\n\nBilly Goat Tavern and Grill: You\u2019re not going to get a unique drink here \u2014 think macro lager. But this place is perfect for what it\u2019s good at: breakfast, hot dogs, burgers, and ice-cold beers.\n\nGalileo\u2019s Bar & Grill: Tiny but necessary. It has Chicago dogs and a full liquor bar.\n\nJazz Bar: Welcome to a full bar at airport prices. If you want it done right, though, this is the place to go for beer, wine, and cocktails.\n\nBerghoff Cafe: German-style draft beer from the Berghoff taps and Chicago hot dogs.\n\nTerminal 2\n\nSkybridge Bar & Grill: A hidden gem in the mountain of O\u2019Hare. This Greek restaurant has classic Greek food and a full bar.\n\nStanley\u2019s Blackhawk Kitchen & Tap: This sports bar is focused on what every good sports bar should be focused on: Bar food and beer.\n\nWicker Park Sushi Bar: Enjoy some sake and shochu with your sushi, and you might just forget that you\u2019re nowhere near the ocean.\n\nTerminal 3\n\nBubbles Wine Bar: Come for a touch of class at this wine bar. If you hadn\u2019t guessed by the name, sparkling wine is on the menu as well as still wine and beer.\n\nChicago Cubs Bar & Grill: The Cubs will never be the same after 2016. What will be the same is the full bar and easy meals served up at this bar and grill.\n\nFacades Bar: No frills bar with TVs, beer, wine, and cocktails.\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s Restaurant and Bar: Pub food and beer on tap.\n\nPrairie Tap: A full bar squeezed into a small location.\n\nPublican Tavern: Recently opened with 10 draft beers and more in bottle and can with a local flair. It also has an intense food menu if you\u2019ve got more time to kill than you would like.\n\nICE Bar: There aren\u2019t many theme bars in airports, especially not O\u2019Hare. ICE is the exception. There are 25 vodkas on the menu, as well as bubbly, wine, and classic spirits.\n\nTerminal 5\n\nHub 51: There aren\u2019t many options if you\u2019re stuck in Terminal 5, but Hub 51 is there to save the day. Local beers, decent wine, and a full cocktail bar.\n\n, ,\n\nShare This!",
