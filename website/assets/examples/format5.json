        "text":"Frequently asked questions\n\nWhat are the benefits of riding and working with horses?\nRiders experience a 3 dimensional movement unique to riding a horse.\u00a0The horse provides a repetitive, rhythmic and variable gait\u00a0which\u00a0helps to improve balance, mobility, core strength, muscle control and posture. Horseback riding mimics the patterns of the human pelvis while walking. All of the body\u2019s muscles are engaged with horseback riding either consciously or unconsciously. Interacting with a horse also has emotional, cognitive and social benefits. The unique relationship formed with the horse can lead to increased confidence, patience, self-esteem, improved motor planning, listening skills and others. Appropriate behaviors are reinforced in a calming environment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWho can this help:\nClients who may benefit can have a variety of diagnoses, such as Cerebral Palsy, Developmental Delay, Traumatic Brain Injury, Stroke, Autism, Attention Deficit Disorder and Learning or Language Disabilities.

        "text":"Residential Real Estate FAQs\n\nCommon Issues With Residential Real Estate\n\nA. Concerns with Buying a Home\n\nWhat are some key issues for me to consider when reviewing a contract to purchase a home?\n\nFew people realize that the purchase contract is the most important step in purchasing a home. The details of this agreement determine what you buy or sell and how you buy it or sell it. Before signing, read the agreement carefully and consider the following (not a complete list of issues but intended to give the reader a good start on things to consider):\n\n  1. Is the purchase contingent on matters such as the availability of financing on acceptable terms or the sale of the house which the buyer presently owns?\n  2. Exactly what land, buildings and furnishings are included in the offer? Are appliances, certain fixtures and other personal property included in the purchase price?\n  3. When can the buyer take possession?\n  4. Is the seller required to provide good, marketable title?\u00a0 Marketable title is title that can be readily marketed (sold) to a reasonably prudent purchaser aware of the facts and their legal meaning concerning liens and encumbrances.\n  5. Who pays for the examination of the title to the property in the event the offer is accepted? \u00a0Who pays for the abstract of title or title insurance?\n  6. Have utilities been installed if the property is new construction?\n  7. Who pays for the cost of the survey of the property? \u00a0Does the lender require a survey as a condition of the loan approval?\n  8. What inspections are required by the municipality?\u00a0 Which party will pay for the inspection? Will there be a home warranty contract paid for by the seller?\u00a0 Should the purchaser conduct and pay for a separate home inspection?\u00a0 What kinds of disclosures is a seller required to provide to a purchaser, and what happens if those disclosures are not provided?\n  9. If a mortgage is to be given, is there a tax or recording fee for the filing of the mortgage. If so, which party will pay that tax?\n  10. If a loan is to be obtained from an outside lender, who will pay the loan closing costs?\n  11. If termite damage is found, will the seller pay the cost of repairs?\n  12. Are there any restrictions on the use of the property?\n  13. If your offer is accepted, who bears the risk of loss if the property is damaged prior to closing?\n  14. What persons (such as husbands or wives) are required to sign and accept the offer?\n  15. Are any of the boundary lines in dispute?\n  16. What are the remedies if the buyer or seller defaults under the contract?\n  17. Are there Realtors\u00ae involved?\u00a0 If so, who pays the commission?\u00a0 Is the commission payable even if the sale does not close?\n  18. Whose responsibility is it to pay for governmental special assessments that arise prior to closing?\n  19. What type of deed will be conveyed?\u00a0 See D below.\n\nB. Concerns with Title\n\n\n1. What is a title examination or abstract? A title examination is a study of the records related to the ownership history of the property and sometimes of other matters related to ownership interests in the property.\u00a0 An abstract of title is a collection of public records relating to the ownership of a parcel of real estate.\u00a0 During the examination a title examiner reviews the applicable title information to determine who owns the lands, whether there are any defects in or claims against the ownership and whether any action is needed to make sure the purchaser obtains good record title to the property at closing.\n\n2. What is title insurance, and why is it needed?\u00a0 A title insurance policy insures the status of title in the name of the owner of the policy.\u00a0 Title insurance policies are issued by title insurance companies.\u00a0 The title company contracts with the insured person named in the policy to protect against financial loss related to the title, as well as the cost of defending the title in court.\u00a0 The title company searches and examines documents related to the ownership of and items affecting the property prior to issuing a policy.\u00a0 It provides a source of indemnification to the named insured if he or she is damaged by a negligent or bad title search or examination and also from hidden defects that would not be discovered in a title search.\u00a0 For instance, a title defect resulting from a forgery would not be revealed in a search or examination of the public records but would be covered by the title insurance policy.\n\nPrior to issuance of the title insurance policy at closing, a title commitment will be prepared.\u00a0 You may or may not be afforded the opportunity to see this document prior to closing, but you should make every effort to review it prior to closing.\u00a0 You should make sure to have your attorney (if you have one) review it as well.\u00a0 While there are many important parts to a title commitment, at a minimum you should be familiar with the following: (i) Schedule A identifies the type of policy being issued, the names of the proposed insureds and the current owners, and the legal description of the property; and (ii) Schedule B contains a list of items that must be satisfied in order for the title company to issue the policy of insurance and also contains a list of title matters (called \"exceptions\") that will be excluded from coverage, such as statutory real estate taxes and easements for utilities servicing the property unless deleted from the title commitment at the time of closing.\u00a0 If there are objectionable items in the commitment, you need to try to have them removed by the title insurance company before closing.\n\nC. Manner in Which Title Is Taken and Held\n\n\nHow should title be held? Make sure you carefully identify all parties taking title and how title is to be held.\u00a0 The following are examples of typical methods of holding title:\n\n  1. Sole Owner.\u00a0 Under this approach, title is taken in the name of only one individual grantee and is freely transferable or subject to encumbrance by that grantee, subject to dower and\/or homestead rights described below.\n\n    Example:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 John Doe, a single man, grantor, to Jane Smith, a single woman, grantee.\n\n  2. Joint Ownership with Right of Survivorship.\u00a0 Title can be taken in multiple names under this approach.\u00a0 Each joint tenant owns an undivided interest in the entire property.\u00a0 The \u201csurvivorship\u201d language means that if one joint tenant dies, that person\u2019s interest automatically is transferred to the remaining joint tenants.\u00a0 Any joint tenant may freely transfer his or her fractional interest in the property during his or her lifetime, but any such transfer will terminate the survivorship aspects of the joint survivorship tenancy to the extent of the interest transferred.\u00a0 Equal ownership shares are presumed unless the deed states otherwise.\u00a0 For example, if there are two grantees, each grantee will own a one-half interest unless the deed specifies otherwise.\n\n    A joint tenancy is created and exists only if four essential characteristics exist: (1) unity of joint ownership and control; (2) the interests held must be the same; (3) the interests must originate in the same instrument; and (4) the interests must commence at the same time.\u00a0 If all or any of these characteristics do not exist, the owners will own the property as tenants in common.\n\n    Example:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 John Doe, a single man, grantor, to Able Smith, Jane Baker and Charles Jones as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\n  3. Tenants by the Entirety.\u00a0 Title can be taken as tenants by the entireties only by a validly married husband and wife.\u00a0 This form of ownership does not exist in all states.\u00a0 The words \u201chusband and wife\u201d in the grantee\u2019s name makes this choice.\u00a0 If a transfer of this type is attempted but the grantees are not validly married, or if they become divorced, the title reverts to tenants in common.\u00a0 As tenants by the entirety, neither tenant may transfer his or her interest to a third party or encumber the property without both parties joining in the deed or mortgage.\u00a0 Upon the death of one party, the property automatically becomes the sole property of the surviving spouse.\u00a0 This is a common form of ownership among married couples, except in community property states.\u00a0 In community property states, the husband and wife presumptively acquire the property as community property and hold it as tenants in common or as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\n    Example:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 John Doe, a single man, grantor, to John Jones and Jane Jones, husband and wife.\n\n  4. Tenants in Common.\u00a0 Title held as tenants in common, like joint tenants, allows title of the entire property to be held in multiple names.\u00a0 Title is also freely transferable or subject to encumbrance (as to the transferring tenant\u2019s own interest) by each tenant.\u00a0 However, there is no right of survivorship in the surviving tenants upon one tenant\u2019s death.\u00a0 Also, note that equal percentage ownership is presumed unless the deed specifically states otherwise.\u00a0 For example, unless the deed states otherwise, if there are three grantees, each grantee will own a one-third interest.\u00a0 It is always best to state each co-owner\u2019s percentage ownership interest in the deed to avoid any uncertainty or misunderstandings.\n\n    Example:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 John Doe, a single man, grantor, to Jane Smith, Sam Wilson and Tom Baker, in equal shares as tenants in common.\n\n    Or John Doe, a single man, grantor, to Jane Smith as to \u00bd interest, Sam Wilson as to \u00bc interest and Tom Baker as to \u00bc interest, as tenants in common.\n\n  5. Title Conveyed in Trust for the Benefit of the Purchasers.\u00a0 Under this approach, legal (record) title is transferred to a trustee (for example, the grantee would be \"John Doe, as trustee under agreement dated June 1, 2005\").\u00a0 Care should be taken in using this approach since there are more complex concerns involved.\n\n  6. Special Marital Property Issues.\u00a0 This is one issue where you must find out if the state in which the property is located has special rules that will require a different statement of ownership...

        "text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nDescribe an appraisal\n\nAn appraisal report is an estimation leading to an opinion of value. The real estate appraiser will use a few \u201capproaches,\u201d typically three, to come to the estimation of market value. The Cost Approach is one of the approaches that appraisers use to find the value of a home; it involves concluding what the improvements would cost less physical degradation, plus the land value. The Sales Comparison Approach involves searching for comparable houses in close proximity and discerning value based on making a comparison of those homes to the home in question. Generally speaking, the Sales Comparison Approach is the most definite indicator of market value of a residential property. The third approach is the Income Approach, which is the most important method in appraising income producing properties \u2013 it deals with estimating what an investor would pay based on the income generated by the property.\n\nWhat does an appraiser do?\n\nAn appraiser produces an impartial and well substantiated determination of market value, in the support of real estate exchanges. Appraisers exhibit their professional conclusions in appraisal reports.\n\nWhat are the reasons someone would request services from Home Appraising Group?\n\nThere are many reasons to order an appraisal with the usual reason being real estate and mortgage transactions. A few other reasons for obtaining an report include:\n\n  \u2022 If you are applying for a loan.\n  \u2022 To reduce your tax burden.\n  \u2022 To show a homeowner has 30% equity and remove PMI.\n  \u2022 To contest inflated property taxes.\n  \u2022 If you need to settle an estate.\n  \u2022 To offer you a negotiating tool when purchasing real estate.\n  \u2022 To find the most probable property value when listing your home.\n  \u2022 To defend your rights if your property is being taken by means of eminent domain in a condemnation case.\n  \u2022 Government agencies such as the IRS need an appraisal on every home.\n  \u2022 It\u2019s possible you could have to deal with being in a lawsuit \u2013 an appraisal will hel\n\nHow is an appraiser different than a home inspector?\n\nThe appraiser is not a home inspector and does not do a full home inspection. An inspection is a third-party evaluation of the accessible structure and appliances of a house, from the roof to the foundation. The usual property inspector\u2019s report will contain an evaluation of the integrity of the house\u2019s heating systems, central air conditioning system (temperature permitting), interior plumbing and electrical systems, the roof, attic, and visible insulation, walls, ceilings, floors, windows and doors, the foundation, basement, and visible structure.\n\nMy agent performed a CMA for me. Is that the same as an appraisal?\n\nTo be blunt, it\u2019s like comparing Shakespeare to reality TV. The CMA relies on indefinite trends in the market. Appraisals use comparable sales which are verifiable resources. Location and building costs are also important in an appraisal. All a CMA does is generate a \u201cball park figure.\u201d Being a documented and carefully investigated opinion of value, appraisals are defensible and stand up in legal situations.\n\nBut the biggest difference is the person doing the report. Real estate agents, who may not have a true grasp of valuation methods or the entire market, create CMA\u2019s. The appraisal is produce by a licensed, certified professional who has made a career out of valuing properties. Likewise, the agent has a vested interest in the property\u2019s selling price \u2013 their commission \u2013 whereas the appraiser is bound by a code of ethics to collect only a previously agreed upon sum for assignments, regardless of their outcome.\n\nWhat\u2019s in an appraisal report?\n\nEach appraisal should indicate a believable value opinion and should document the following:\n\n  \u2022 The client and whose purposes the appraisal is to serve.\n  \u2022 The intended use of the report.\n  \u2022 The appraisal\u2019s purpose.\n  \u2022 The type of value contained and a definition of that value.\n  \u2022 The effective date of the value opinion.(Sometimes this is in the past or maybe the future for new construction!)\n  \u2022 Relevant property characteristics, including: location, physical description, legal attributes, economic factors, the real property interest valued, and non-real estate items included in the valuation, such as personal property, trade fixtures and even intangible factors.\n  \u2022 Any known easements, restrictions, encumbrances, leases, reservations, covenants, contracts, declarations, special assessments, ordinances, and other items of a similar nature.\n  \u2022 Division of interest, such as fractional interest, physical segment and partial holding.\n  \u2022 The scope of work used when completing the appraisal.\n\nFor a more detailed look at the work that goes into an appraisal report click here:Sample Appraisal Report\n\nOnce the appraisal has been delivered, what assurance is there that the value conclusion is accurate?\n\nIn communicating an appraisal report, each appraiser must ensure the following:\n\n  \u2022 That the information analysis implemented in the appraisal was proper.\n  \u2022 That critical errors of omission or commission were not committed individually or collectively.\n  \u2022 That appraisal services were provided in a careful and judicious fashion.\n  \u2022 That a trustworthy, defensible appraisal report was communicated.\n\nTo become a state certified appraiser, there are intense education requirements as well as practical experience that must be logged \u2013 all with the objective of gaining the skills required to provide unbiased value opinions. Plus, appraisers must stick to a strict industry code of ethics and observe national standards of practice for real estate appraisal. The guidelines for developing an appraisal and documenting its results are guaranteed by enforcement of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).\n\nLicensing and certification takes coursework, tests and experience working under a supervisor. Once licensed, he\/she is required to engage in continuing education courses in order to keep the license up to date. To see the specific requirements for any state\u00a0click here.\n\nWho engages the services of appraisers?\n\nCommonly, appraisers are hired by mortgage lenders to estimate the value of a home involved in a loan transaction. Appraisers also provide opinions in litigation cases, tax matters and investment decisions.\n\nWhere does an appraiser get the data used to estimate values in Philadelphia County or other areas?\n\nCompiling information is one of the primary tasks an appraiser does. Data can be categorized as either Specific or General. Specific data is gathered from the home itself; Location, condition, amenities, size and other specific data are documented by the appraiser during an inspection.\n\nGeneral data is gathered from a numerous places. To find out about recent sales to be used as \u201ccomps\u201d, an appraiser will often use the local Multiple Listing Service. To verify actual sales prices, we look at tax records and other public documents that are usually online nowadays. Appraisers often need to report when a property is in a flood zone, and that information is retrieved from a FEMA data outlet\u00a0service.\n\nAnd most importantly, the appraiser gathers general data from his or her past experience in creating appraisals for other properties in the same market.\n\nWhy should I hire a certified appraiser?\n\nIf you\u2019re involved in some sort of financial decision and the value of your home is relevant, you\u2019ll want a full appraisal. For those selling a home, you\u2019ll want to determine the price that gets you the most profit but also ensures you don\u2019t have to wait too long for a buyer to show up; an appraisal can help with that. When buying, be sure you\u2019re not overpaying by commissioning an independent appraisal. If you\u2019re engaged in an estate settlement or divorce, it ensures that property is divided fairly. A house is often the single, largest financial asset anybody owns. Knowing its true value is essential to making informed financial decisions.\n\nWhat exactly is PMI and how can I get rid of it?\n\nPMI is an acronym for Private Mortgage Insurance. It protects the lender if a borrower defaults on the loan and the market price of the home is less than what the borrower still owes on the loan. Once you reach the point where your home\u2019s equity plus the amount you\u2019ve paid is at least 20% of your loan balance, you can have your PMI dropped.\n\nHas your real estate appreciated since you first purchased? Contact Home Appraising Group today at (215)531-7979 to see if you can cancel your Private Mortgage Insurance payment.\n\nDoes the appraiser need anything from me in advance?\n\nWe start with an inspection of the home. What this entails is the appraiser, after setting up an appointment, personally going through the home \u2013 recording the layout of the rooms, taking photos and documenting the general condition of its features. On the home\u2019s interior, pick up any clutter and make sure we can access things like furnaces and water heaters. On the outside, trim any bushes so we can be free to get an accurate measurement of outside walls.\n\nTo help expedite our work as well as ensure a more accurate report, attempt if possible to have the following items:\n\n  \u2022 A survey or plot map of the property and building (if available).\n  \u2022 Any documents, such as a title policy with information on encroachments or easements encroachments or easements.\n  \u2022 Any inspection reports, or other recent reports for termites, EIFS (synthetic stucco) wall systems, your septic system and your well.\n  \u2022 Find copies of the current listing agreement, broker\u2019s data sheet and, if the sale is \u201cpending\u201d, the purchase agreement.\n  \u2022 A bill for your most recent real estate taxes which should also contain a legal description of the property.\n\nHow does an appraiser define \u201cMarket Value\u201d?\n\nIn real estate appraising, Market Value (as opposed to Fair Market Value) is commonly defined\u00a0as:\n\n\u201cThe most probable price (in terms of money) which a property should brin...

        "text":"Selling FAQs\n\nThere are a few things to consider when selling your property:\n\n\u00b7 Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)\n\nYou are legally required to provide an EPC when you market your property for sale. This outlines the energy efficiency rating of your property. sbliving can organise this for you.\n\n\u00b7 Conveyancing\n\nConveyancing is the legal transfer of your property to the buyer, and you will need to employ a solicitor to make this happen. sbliving can introduce you to a solicitor who can guide you through the process.\n\n\u00b7 Estate Agent Fees\n\nHere at sbliving we listen to what your needs are and discuss a range of options that will work best for you.\n\nYou may also decide to pay for extras such as professional photography or advanced marketing and promotions. And don\u2019t forget about removals. We can advise and assist you in all these matters.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely up to you. We can conduct viewings for you or you can choose to manage these yourself.\n\nThis depends on a number of things, such as your approach to pricing your property and the position both you and your buyer are in. If your home has been realistically valued, you should expect to receive offers within the first four weeks. Then, assuming your buyer has to apply for their mortgage, the exchange of contracts normally takes between 4 and 6 weeks and\u00a0then completion is between 2 and 4 weeks later. So in total you should expect 12-14 weeks to complete the sale.\n\nIn England, all sellers are required to purchase an EPC for a property before they sell it. Your estate agents\u00a0must display the EPC rating whenever they market your property.\u00a0We will be happy to discuss this with you.\n\nConveyancing\u2019 is the legal process that happens when you transfer your home to the buyer. You will typically need a solicitor to assist you with this, to make it happen. We can introduce you to a solicitor who can guide you through the legal process when moving home.\n\nNo, the property buyer is responsible for paying stamp duty. You will have to pay it on any property you purchase.\n\nOnce the buyer has made an offer, it is likely they will arrange for a surveyor to visit you home. The five key things a surveyor will be looking for are problems with utilities, damp, cracking, problems with roofs, and timber defects. In addition, your buyer\u2019s mortgage lender will typically\u00a0 organise a mortgage valuation to confirm that the property is worth the money being lent.\n\nOnce the sale has been agreed, your solicitor will draft a contract. Your buyer\u2019s solicitor will confirm the details of the property and perform searches. At the same time, the buyer\u2019s mortgage lender will conduct a mortgage valuation and send a mortgage offer to the buyer. When all of this is complete, you will be ready to sign the contract and agree the completion date.\n\nThe seller or the buyer can pull out of the sale at any time and for any reason until the point that both solicitors have received signed contracts from both parties.\n\nWhen both contracts have been signed, the buyer\u2019s solicitor will request the mortgage from the buyer\u2019s lender. Once these funds are released, then your solicitor and the buyer\u2019s solicitor will consult both parties and agree a completion date.\n\nYour title deeds give proof of ownership of the property and will need to be transferred to the buyer as part of the conveyancing process. These are usually held by your mortgage lender, and it will be your solicitor\u2019s responsibility to obtain these.\n\nThis depends on what you have agreed with your buyer. You are not required to leave any furniture or furnishings in the property, but you may have agreed to include some as part of the negotiations of the sale.\n\nThe contract will specify the completion day, and usually the buyer will be asked to collect the keys to their new home from the estate agent. In most cases the seller is asked to vacate the property by 12pm.\n\nUsually, you are only required to pay Capital Gains Tax if the property is not your main home.",

        "text":"\n\n\nForgot your password?\nUser Journal\n\nJournal Bible_Study_Guys's Journal: Introduction \/ FAQ 27\n\nAs it says in the Bio, this is an account shared by TechnoLust, glh, and eugene ts wong. We are going to attempt to do a Bible study in this journal every week. We will leave comments enabled for discussion. The email associated with this account is also shared by us, so you can reach us at that address.\n\nWho's crazy idea was this?\nThat would be mine. (-TechnoLust) I noticed that there are a great many journals about religion and moral issues around. Most people are very vocal of their opinion. I have always felt that God would use me to reach people in nontraditional ways. I felt that this would a good way for people to get together and discuss their ideas and beliefs with anonymity. Many people are more willing to talk about religion if it is anonymous.\n\nWhat makes you think this will work?\nFaith. :-) Actually, I just think that people want to discuss (notice I didn't write argue) religion and the Bible, and this seems to be an interesting venue in which to do that.\n\nWhy a shared account? Why not just do it your journal?\nSome of my \/. friends are Christians and would be interested in this. Others would not, and I didn't want them to stop reading my journal because they weren't interested in the Religion stuff. I also wanted to reach outside the FortKnox circle, if that's possible. :-) Because of my work schedule, I might not be able to dedicate enough time every week, and I didn't want to miss weeks or have the lessons suffer. So a shared account fixes a lot of these problems.\n\nWhy do this on slashdot?\nSeveral reasons... All of the people that I think would be interested are already here. People who might otherwise never come to something like this might stumble across us here. The interface is familiar. Most people that would be interested are going to be on \/. anyway, so adding us to their friend list and getting a message when a new lesson is available is not a big deal.\n\nHow are you going to deal with the ever-present trolls?\nWe will maintain a \"friends\" list of people who are posting in the journal, and a \"foe\" list of people who are trolling this journal. If you want, you can turn \"friend of friend\" & \"foe of friend\" modifiers on, and read at +1 or higher, so you won't see the trolls in the journal. Since this will be religious discussion, I imagine we'll get some bad trolls.\n\nWhy don't you guys do a lesson about...?\nIf you would like to participate in preparing Bible study topics or suggest a topic of study, email us at the address above. If you have questions, send those, and we will try to periodically do a Q&A session. If you would like to help, but don't have ideas for a topic, then pray for us.\n\nSo, are you guys starting a cult, or do you just think you are so perfect you need to tell everyone else how to live?\nNo, we don't want to start a cult, or the First Church of Slashdot. [If you are interested in joining a slashdot cult, click here. :-) ] We just want to discuss the Bible and religion. I don't think I'm perfect or better than anyone. I'm not sinless, just forgiven. You don't have to agree with everything we say, (that would make for a pretty dull comment section) but if you disagree, don't just say, \"You guys are wrong!\" Tell us why you think we are wrong, and explain your side politely and intelligently. I don't claim to be a minister. I've had no formal training, but I do love God and I think this is something He wants me to do. -TL\n\nThere's no religion topic icon, so are you randomly picking an icon when you post?\nNo. We will try to pick an icon that somehow relates to the lesson. It may even be that a \/. story under that topic triggered the lesson.\n\nThis discussion has been archived. No new comments can be posted.\n\nIntroduction \/ FAQ\n\nComments Filter:\n  \u2022 Just add the .com If you need a normal address, email me there, and I'll send it to you. Disclaimer: I won't be throwing it out anytime soon, so it isn't really that disposable.\n\n    On an unrelated note: I'm surprised at how quickly someone has already trolled this journal.\n    \u2022 No, I knew trolls would be a problem. People who have no religion are tormented because they know SOMETHING has to be responsible for all this. Since they are tormented, they want to make sure those of us who know the truth and are happy get some torment as well. So they try to make us question our beliefs. All it does for me is make me glad I have the back bone to post logged in. :-)\n      \u2022 I think a lot of it is fear. People fear what they don't understand. Some non-religious people don't understand how one could be religious.\n\n        Yes, some non religious people are tormented by the need for an explanation, but many are not.\n\n        I am not a religious person, but I will probably follow Bible_Study_Guys journals and I may even ask some questions.\n        \u2022 Great! Questions are more than welcome..\n\n          I'm sure we will be posting more detail on this journal soon.\n        \u2022 I think a lot of it is fear.\n\n          I don't think its either. I think people troll religious people for two very opposite reasons:\n          1.) The amish factor - Religious people are not going to 'attack' you, personally. Its in their creed not to. So they take the beating and 'turn the other cheek' (heh, mathew reference...)\n          2.) The upset factor - One thing religious people don't enjoy is being told they are wrong, and it disturbs some of them noticably. There's nothing better to a troll than to see someone have a reaction to what they say (its the whole point of them trolling, right?).\n\n          Honestly, having a science background is nice in this respect. I am a Christian, but if someone wants to come and tell me I'm daydreaming, I'll listen to all their arguments, just never truely agree to them. I like to keep an open mind, its easier to show certain people the way of Christianity if you know how they think and what they think.\n          I also enjoy understanding other religions. I've taken out coworkers to have an understanding of hinduism and buddhism. Interesting stuff, IMHO.\n\n          BTW - This will be the best forum for your questions. You will get realistic and laid back comments that should (hopefully) be easy to read and keep you comfortable. I know to most people getting a 'tv evangelist' answer can make you comfortable and will tune most people out :-D\n      \u2022 People who have no religion are tormented because they know SOMETHING has to be responsible for all this.\n\n        Yes, and I am the one responsible for all of this. Fear me, for I am Elkobim, the god of the dice.\n\n        I hereby declare that nobody is going to be tormented for not believing in god. However, you must sacrifice dice for me.\n\n        Thank you very much.\n\n        I find the idea of \"bible study guys\" horribly ridculous.. The unproductivity associated with talking about ancient, unimportant stuff is equal to the importance of trolling in slashdot..\n\n        Btw: What's with the \"Foes of friends\" thingie? I can't agree with it. You can't just put people under your threshold because the commune decided they are \"bad people\". It's a perfect manifestation of groupthink.\n        \u2022 ...then don't read it. Those of us that know better will \"waste\" our time on it, and it doesn't harm you in the least. The foes of friends thing only works if you add this account as a friend. If you don't choose to do so, it won't affect you. All of these things we are doing are offered as choices, we are forcing no one to do anything they do not wish to. If someone wishes to read the trolls, all they have to do is change the foe of friend modifier, or not log in. We just know that some trolls have a tendency to use foul language, and offer our readers a way to filter it.\n\n          BTW - Unproductivity is not a word (check I think the word you were searching for was unproductiveness.\n\n    \u2022 are you kidding? I thought to myself, \"They're going to need their own special access to cope with the trolls and idiots\".\n  \u2022 I just warn you, unless warned I have a lot to say. :-)\n\n  \u2022 (distorted guitar starts)\n\n    Repent, repent, repent ye sinners\n\n    What do you think you got, when you thought you had a lot\n    But all your feelings are dead?\n    And who do you think you are, when you're reaching for the stars\n    But all your feelings are dead?\n\n    Must you make a decision, between sex and religion\n    Why can't you love God in your bed?\n\n    Well, Jesus Christ is in your bed tonight, to bring you back from the dead\n\n    How are you gonna fight for what you think is right\n    If all your feelings are dead?\n    And what can you know of love, from the eyes of a child to the heavens above\n    When all your feelings are dead?\n\n    It's a tragic condition, sex and religion, makin' a manic mess in your head\n\n\n    Jesus Christ, or any son of the heatless light\n    When all your feelings are dead\n\n\n    I raise my hands high up into the air\n    Get down on my knees and start-a-prayin'\n    When love walks in, my body begins\n    I feel my promised land comin', but I gotta go to Hell now\n    And those creatures, evangelist preachers\n    The ones that take money, for the promise of hope\n    Well, they are dangerous, I'm not dangerous\n    Brain washing us, and we're not gonna take it\n\n\n    I just wanna know, oh, Lord, how it is so\n    How is it that you can take my sins away?\n    Oh, Lord tell me, so I can see the light again\n    I don't think anybody can take my sins away\n\n    How can the truth be known, if we got little black holes in our souls\n    And all our feelings are dead?\n\n    Are we imprisoned by sex and religion\n    Or is God the one that's trapped in our mess?\n\n\n    Jesus Christ, or any son of the heatless light\n    To bring you back from the dead\n\n    [evil voice] So remember now folks, when you kneel to pray\n    Blow a little kiss to the hypocrites\n    Good God knows when you turn the other cheek\n    Wh...
