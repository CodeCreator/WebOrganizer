And one said the problem was that his parents had Munchausen syndrome. Still another said all he needed was a good old-fashioned spanking.\"\nAuthor: Pseudonymous Bosch\n12. \"Nowadays a lot of what was wrong with me would no doubt be ascribed to Attention Deficit Disorder, tartrazine food colouring, dairy produce and air pollution.

By painless they left out that their way of correcting the heart problem painlessly was to stick 2 catheders into either side of my happy stick and run wires all the way up to my heart. Oh, and the proceedure took 2 hours on a metal table with only a sheet in a 12 degree operating room with no anestisia and if I moved even a little bit I could kill myself. The funny side note to this, the cardioligist who performed this miracle of modern science.... Dr. Barry S. Pepper. Spleen out my mouth sounds like a walk in the park comparitively.\n\nOh, and not that I'm bitter or anything. Just sayin!\n\n*Resumes panic*\n\nAccording to Mrs. Deaner, since men do much of their thinking with their \"happy stick\", brain surgery on said men would be the only direct surgical path with any of these procedures.\n\nDo these doctors even think about what the rest of us think about this kind of thing?

For example, recent sessions were based on a quiz to see how much the young people knew about correct use of condoms, STIs, and the \u2018C-Card\u2019 free condom scheme.\u00a0 These sessions were delivered to separate groups of males and females; some of the young people found discussion difficult to join, but were encouraged by those who already knew more about the subject. Thirteen young men registered for the C-Card as a result of the sessions.\n\nThe young people heard from a speaker from \u2018Hertsaid\u2019, the charity that strives for an inclusive society where HIV and sexual health are understood and accepted. Future sessions are planned on drugs and alcohol awareness, to be delivered by Youth Connexions staff.\n\nOne of the participants, George, said \u201cI love coming to the centre\u201d \u00a0Dean and Melissa, other attendees, added that \u201cThe project brings young people together.\u201d\n\nFind out more about the Peartree project.\n\nFind a Youth Connexions project near you.",
