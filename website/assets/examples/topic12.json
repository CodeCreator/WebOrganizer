But with temperatures rising very quickly, be sure not to put your pet in harms way.\u00a0Check out some heat safety tips for keeping your pets cool and safe during the hot summer months.\n\n\nNever leave your pets in the car\n\nHeat Safety\n\nEven on warm, sunny days, the inside of a car heats up quickly, even with windows cracked. Never leave your animal alone in a parked car. If you see an animal in a car on a hot day and cannot locate the owner, call 911! Then, stay by the car until help arrives.\n\n\nWatch out for hot pavement!\n\nDark pavement easily absorbs heat when the weather is very sunny and hot. Avoid pets walking on pavement for extended periods of time as this captured heat from the pavement can warm an animals body and potentially burn paw pads. To see if pavement temperature is too hot, place your bare hand or bare foot on the pavement. If the pavement is too hot for you, it is too hot for your pet!\n\n\nProvide cold water and shade\n\nIf you must have your pet outdoors or must house our pets outside, provide them with a shaded shelter, and always make sure they have plenty of cold water.\n\n\nBe practical\n\nAs much as we love spending time with our pets, we need to keep their safety a priority. Leave your pets at home if you plan to be outdoors for extended periods of time, if the weather is too hot, or if your activity level will be too intense for your animal. It is better to be safe than sorry.\n\n\n\nA dog\u2019s normal body temperature is 101 to 102.5 degrees. If her temperature reaches 107 degrees, she can suffer brain damage or even death.\n\nHeatstroke symptoms include: excessive panting, a sudden stopping of panting, salivation, an anxious or staring expression, weakness, muscle tremors, red tongue, blue lips, vomiting, collapse or coma.\n\nIf your dog show symptoms of heatstroke, immediately do the following:\n\n  \u2022 Move the dog to a cool, shady place\n  \u2022 Pour cool water on him and offer him some water to drink\n  \u2022 Fan him vigorously to promote evaporation\n  \u2022 Rush him to the veterinarian\n\nDO NOT apply ice, since it will constrict blood flow and inhibit cooling.\n\n\nIntense heat can cause the same problems for pets as it does for humans, including overheating, dehydration, sunburn and heatstroke.\n\nFor more ways to help keep pets safe, download and share our Pet Heat Safety flyer to alert others of the dangers and severity of hot weather for pets.\n\nVisit our Amazon wish list\n\nPetco Foundation\n\nPet Wellness Days\n\nLow-Cost Pet Vaccination Clinics!\n\nComplete Annual Vaccination Packages for Dogs & Cats Starting at Only $40!\n\nLearn More...\n\n\nFollow Us!\n\nLifeLine Animal Project\n\nFounded in 2002 and now managing DeKalb and Fulton County Animal Services, LifeLine Animal Project is the leading non-profit organization working to end the euthanasia of healthy and treatable dogs and cats in metro Atlanta shelters.

        "text":"Clare Wexler examines why commissioners and patients must behave differently if care pathways for the treatment of chronic disease are to improve\n\nA diabetes test\n\nThere can be little doubt that improving the management of long-term conditions is one of the NHS\u2019 biggest priorities. Around one in three people in the UK are currently living with a chronic condition, and \u00a37 of every \u00a310 spent on the health budget goes towards supporting them. It is estimated that by 2018, nearly three million people will have three or more conditions at any one time.\n\n\u2018It is time for the NHS and patients to think differently. Technology will undoubtedly sit at the centre of the solution\u2019\n\nThe impact on the health service, both in terms of cost and the ability to deliver quality care, is significant; demand is dramatically outstripping resources. The impact on patients, however, is even more critical. Health outcomes are suffering as, all too often, patients become disengaged from their care and are forced to endure unnecessary hospital treatment or sustained unemployment, because their condition has not been managed optimally.\u00a0\n\nThe health secretary has vowed to free patients with chronic diseases from the \u201cmerry-go-round of doctors\u2019 surgeries and hospitals\u201d \u2013 but, without meaningful change, the situation will only get worse.\n\nTo progress, we not only need to change the way the NHS works, but we must also transform how patients interact with their healthcare, and redesign care pathways to put patients at the centre of it.\n\nThe current model of managing long-term conditions is unsustainable. The tipping point is fast approaching; it is time for the NHS and patients to think \u2013 and behave \u2013 differently. And technology will undoubtedly sit at the centre of the solution.\n\nTechnology: the great enabler\n\nThe discussion has now moved beyond debating whether technology can play a part in transforming patient care \u2013 to succeed, it must. Tomorrow\u2019s healthcare model must optimise technology, harness the power of information and share it across the health and social care system in ways that join up care, connect organisations and empower patients.\n\nMoreover, if the NHS is to deliver patient-centric services built on the principle of \u201cno decisions about me, without me\u201d \u2013 and in the process, facilitate more effective management of chronic disease \u2013 the integrated use of innovations such as telehealth and health coaching must become the rule rather than the exception.\n\n\u2018In isolation, educating patients is not enough to bring about true behavioural change\u2019\n\nThe NHS mandate outlines an NHS Commissioning Board objective to drive a substantial increase in the use of technology to help people manage their health and care. It encourages clinical commissioning groups, providers and local councils to collaborate to overcome the practical barriers that prevent services working together effectively \u2013 and, in particular, it challenges local commissioners to stimulate the development of innovative, integrated service provision across primary, secondary and social care.\n\nThe mandate promises to make \u201csignificant progress\u201d towards helping patients with long-term conditions to benefit from telehealth and telecare, enabling them to manage and monitor their conditions at home, thereby reducing avoidable hospital admissions and improving health outcomes.\n\nNew landscape\n\nWith the emergence of a new NHS commissioning landscape just around the corner, CCGs and local authorities must work in partnership to ensure that local health and social care budgets are not eroded by the inefficient management of long-term conditions. The most proactive will take advantage of innovative technologies that already exist.\n\nAt a national level, tools to assist shared decision making between patients and clinicians are being implemented as part of the quality, innovation, productivity and prevention Right Care programme and are, at present, providing patients with vital information across key diseases areas.\n\nAlthough this provides a powerful platform to nurture informed patients, it is widely recognised that, in isolation, educating patients is not enough to bring about true behavioural change.\n\nIndividuals diagnosed with long-term conditions commonly require ongoing support as they seek to adapt their lifestyles. Health coaching, therefore, is emerging as a valuable integrated adjunct to shared decision making, which can help patients manage long-term conditions.\n\nIntegrated health coaching\n\nHealth coaching programmes are proven to be highly effective in driving behavioural change among patients, to support specific disease management programmes. Their implementation is a simple and natural extension of existing processes.\n\nWith early intervention widely accepted as the most practical and effective way of managing long-term conditions, patients at high risk of developing them, who could benefit most from health coaching, will commonly have been identified through standard risk stratification exercises within local health organisations.\n\nIn the health coaching model, specially trained health practitioners act as individual case managers, and regularly engage in bi-directional telephone dialogue with target patients, combining treatment and lifestyle advice with education and disease management principles.\n\n\u2018Building a new model for the management of long-term conditions is not impossible, it\u2019s already happening\u2019\n\nThis can help ensure patients adhere to recommendations in line with care pathways set out by local clinicians and commissioners. Crucially, health coaching programmes are conducted in partnership with local health organisations, ensuring that clinicians maintain total control of the patient relationship.\n\nThe approach has been shown to motivate patients towards a readiness to change their unhelpful thinking patterns. It can facilitate their confidence and skills in self-management, encourage behavioural change and also helps them prepare for consultations and proactively consider treatment options.\n\nMoreover, with patients conscious that consultation time with their GP is limited, health coaching provides a valuable opportunity for people to discuss the longer-term management and implications of their condition, thereby proactively managing their disease.\n\nEvidence increasingly underlines that, when health coaching programmes have been deployed, patient satisfaction levels have soared and outcomes have improved. What\u2019s more, as a consequence of individual behavioural change, unplanned emergency care across all sectors of the NHS and social care naturally reduces, resulting in positive implications for the local health economy. The approach has clear benefits for all key stakeholders:\n\n  \u2022 Patients: quality of life improves, with fewer chronic episodes putting people in greater control of their condition.\n  \u2022 GPs: managing patients with long-term conditions becomes more effective and cost effective, while total control of patient care is maintained.\n  \u2022 NHS: costs reduce and system capacity increases due to the avoidance of unplanned emergency care.\n\nIntegrating care\n\nIntegrated health coaching programmes are underpinned by robust technologies. Health coaches routinely \u2013 and transparently \u2013 capture vital health data and share it securely with key stakeholders across the health and social care system. This can alert clinicians to when intervention may be necessary, inform future consultations and join up care.\n\nAs technology advances, the potential to integrate health coaching with mobile telehealth applications provides a powerful opportunity to tailor personalised care, thereby ensuring the right message gets to the right person at the right time via the most appropriate route, be that by telephone, text message, online or mobile app.\n\nIn an integrated care system, the key components of patient-centric services cannot operate in isolation. Electronic healthcare and telehealth offer tremendous potential to transform services but, on their own, they will achieve little \u2013 they must be joined together.\n\nHealth coaching provides a human mechanism to sit at the centre and evaluate all available linked data, as well as identifying areas where technology can help reduce costs and improve care pathways. Holistic systems that combine shared decision making, telehealth and health coaching are, therefore, critical to the effective management of long-term conditions.\n\nTo optimise the opportunity, tomorrow\u2019s commissioners must capitalise on today\u2019s innovations. Fully integrated, scalable systems, which can transform patient services, can be implemented quickly and easily at low cost. Building a new model for the management of long-term conditions is not impossible \u2013 it\u2019s already happening. And it works. It just requires some innovative thinking.\n\nClare Wexler is chief executive of Totally Health",

At Virginia Center for Reproductive Medicine, we are able to stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple eggs and retrieve them from your ovaries.\n\nEgg freezing and IVF, when the time is right, helps women achieve the goal of a pregnancy on their terms and timeline.\n\nYour biological clock is a reality; freezing your eggs stops it\n\nVCRM is pleased to announce its new financial program to encourage women to freeze their eggs for fertility preservation. Our unique program allows you to pay 50% of the fee at treatment start and then pay the other 50% in monthly installments over one year with zero financing charge. This should help make this process within financial reach for most working women. For more details about our innovative program please call the office at 703-437-7722 or email us at\nWe want women to be informed about fertility and the reasons why egg freezing can help. A woman\u2019s fertility begins to decline in her early 20s and continues to progressively decline until she is in her late 30s, when fertility steeply declines.\n\nDeteriorating fertility can\u2019t be reversed, but egg freezing gives you the potential to avert the risks by preserving younger eggs. The age of a woman\u2019s eggs is directly related to the chances for getting pregnant.\n\nAt our Virginia fertility center, we encourage women to pursue egg freezing before age 38. After age 38, there are often fewer viable eggs available to be retrieved and preserved, necessitating multiple attempts to freeze enough eggs.\n\nWho is a good candidate for elective egg freezing?\n\nWomen may choose egg freezing for many different reasons.\n\n  \u2022 Single women in their late 20s and early-to-mid 30s who want to have a family in the future\n  \u2022 Women with a strong family history of early menopause or premature ovarian failure\n  \u2022 Women with ovarian endometriomas or recurring ovarian cysts\n  \u2022 Women undergoing fertility treatment who would prefer to freeze eggs, not embryos\n\nNow that this procedure has been proven to be a safe and reliable procedure, some women choose to use frozen eggs during IVF at our Virginia fertility center. Our laboratory staff performs a reliable, state-of-the-art technique called vitrification to freeze unfertilized eggs that can be fertilized at a later time.\n\nWe were pioneers in the process of freezing eggs\n\nVCRM was the first fertility center in the DC metro area to offer egg freezing in 2003. Dr. Fady Sharara, our dual board certified fertility specialist, and our experienced laboratory team will\u00a0oversee your procedure. If you are considering egg freezing, contact us.

Everyone seems to have his or her own opinions of what is best (read easiest to do on their shift) for Peter.\n\nMommy is about to lose her temper with someone either in the hospital or at the Medicaid office, so don't be too surprised if you hear about us on the evening news!\n\nWe are eager to get Peter home so that we can take care of his needs the way we feel is best. Plus, we give him lots of healing hugs and kisses!\n\nPete is a cutie and enjoyed another fun day with Grandma & Grandpa Dankelson, as well as a short outing to the cafeteria.\n\nHope everyone is enjoying a quiet week. We loved hearing from several of you in your Christmas cards, and your well wishes for Peter are very appreciated.\n\n\nDede & Darin\n\n(Mother, Father, Nurses & Advocates for \"Sweet Little Pete\")\n\n\u00a9 2013-2020\u00a0Pete's Diary\n\nPete's Diary | Chicago",
