        "text":"Gransnet forums\n\nAsk a gran\n\nUpdate on grandaughter\n\n(24 Posts)\nbreeze Fri 28-Feb-14 09:49:21\n\nHi to all of you who gave such valuable advice on monday re my worries over my grandaughter's health. I was very upset and worried as you know. She saw GP this morning. He said he suspects it is a vitamin deficiency. He has prescribed antibiotic cream and a product to replace her usual Johnsons baby bath. He said more red meat in her diet. He will assess her again in a couple of months. He said the tests on a small child for vitamin deficiency are a bit traumatic, so won't go that route unless she does not improve or the sores and hair loss get worse.\n\nMy son also discovered that the HV 'was' alerted by the NHS after the Calpol incident and a HV 'did' visit! Kept that one quiet!\n\nThe doctor, after my son voiced concerns about her speech, is arranging for a HV to assess her.\n\nSo most things that can be resolved are being resolved.\n\nAnd you should all be very proud of yourselves. As you gave me the confidence, to give my son the confidence to sort the problems out by letting us know he does have rights as a father, even though he wasn't married.\n\nSo a little girl has now had the help she needed thanks to you all. I am so grateful.\n\nBest wishes to you all.\n\nffinnochio Fri 28-Feb-14 09:58:31\n\nThat good to hear breeze.

        "text":"What eradicating diseases tells us about how to change the\u00a0world\n\nLet\u2019s talk about eradicating illness and what that teaches us about how to change the world. Specifically, let\u2019s zero in on how healthcare workers approach the different forms of rationality people and cultures use to understand their world, and from there, apply what we learn to global issues.\n\nRationality is the means through which we understand the world. As I discussed previously, we can classify rationality into four broad categories:\n\n  \u2022 Disembedded\u2014Seeks an objective truth that is independent of us; gained through analysis and experimentation\n  \u2022 Embedded\u2014Focuses on truths embedded in a social context; gained through understanding the social environment in which you operate\n  \u2022 Embodied\u2014Sees knowledge as something achieved through our visceral, lived experience\n  \u2022 Collective\u2014The means through which groups and societies understand their world and act.\n\nIn this post, we are going to focus on contextual rationality, which is a specific type of embedded rationality that my research shows is vital in the spread of innovations.\n\nContextual rationality describes truths that members of a culture or group hold in common. For example, in the university where I work, we believe the best teachers are those with industry experience, whereas research-based universities think academics make the best instructors. Different groups \u201cknow\u201d (or believe) different things, and so the rational act differs depending on the group with which you are interacting.\n\nWhat does this have to do with eradicating disease and, as I alluded earlier, changing the world?\n\nThe role of contextual rationality in eradicating a disease\n\nA recent Atlanta article discussed the work of Dr. Donald Hopkins who has been instrumental in the battle against not one, but two diseases. Several quotes from the article highlighted the importance of respecting the contextual rationality of the people with whom medical workers dealt. Workers described approaching remote towns and traditional societies in their efforts to eradicate the Guinea worm infection.\n\nGuinea worm is the subject of considerable mythology\u2014the worms have been viewed as both messages from ancestors and the product of witchcraft\u2014and those beliefs need to be addressed respectfully \u2026 \u2018When you enter a village, you leave your culture behind,\u2019 says Adam Weiss, associate director of the Carter Center\u2019s Guinea worm eradication program. \u2018We can\u2019t come in heavy-handed and say, \u2018You must do X, Y, Z.\u2019 We all know how human beings respond to that.\u2019\n\nAtlanta Magazine\n\nIf we with our medical science, however, \u201cknow\u201d the Guinea worm has nothing to do with witchcraft, if we with our medical science \u201cknow\u201d how to eradicate this disease, why do care workers still put in time and effort to respect superstitions that, at times, allow the disease to flourish?\n\nBecause mobilizing a population to act to eradicate a disease requires collective action between groups. Productive collaboration requires trust, which, in turn, is built on mutual respect. For inhabitants of these remote towns and traditional societies to take the actions recommended by healthcare workers, they first have to trust them. To earn this trust, these workers must respect the power of the townsfolk\u2019s contextual rationality.\n\nHow does this help us change the world?\n\nThe above insight is likely unsurprising to anyone who has had to work with groups or cultures different than their own. Healthcare workers seeking to stamp out disease in the remotest areas of the world know this lesson well.\n\nYet, when dealing with people on either side of the vaccine issue, GMOs, climate change, and other hot-button issues of our time, we have forgotten this lesson utterly. We treat those on the other side of the debate with shameful disrespect. Without respect, there is no trust; without trust, we cannot act. We, instead, fight, eroding trust further.\n\nToday, we face some of the biggest challenges of our species\u2019 history. Perhaps such problems call for unprecedented levels of collaboration. If you believe this to be true, maybe the healthcare workers collaborating with isolated communities have something to teach us. They start with a genuine desire to help others. From there, they choose to respect the groups they encounter, create trust, and then build the future.\n\nDo you have experiences bridging the divide between groups? These are the stories we must share. I would love to read them in the comments.\n\nIf you find this topic interesting, let me know by clicking \u201clike\u201d and share with your peers.

        "text":"Opinion: New survey establishes a data-driven baseline for diversity in digital health\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a unicorn,\u201d the investor said.\n\nThe first time she called me that, I responded with a nervous laugh and downplayed her comment. But that didn\u2019t stop her. She went on to explain that she called me a unicorn because I\u2019m a physician, I\u2019ve had a successful academic career, and I\u2019ve been in the C-suite of a venture-backed digital health company that scaled and recently had an IPO.\n\nShe didn\u2019t even add the obvious: I am also a Black woman.\n\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been described as a unicorn too many times to count. I no longer bristle at the term, but continue to be bothered by its implications. A unicorn is a mythical creature. I\u2019m a real person and there are others like me.\n\nUsing the unicorn lens to define my identity narrows the scope of what is possible for people from underrepresented groups, so I am on a mission to make sure that they are valued and included as we work to transform health care.\n\n\nRepresentation matters\n\nWho greenlights funding, who gets funded, what efforts get attention, and how effective those efforts are in reducing cost or improving outcomes among specific groups all matter.\n\nThe digital health ecosystem is more active than ever, and so far in 2020 U.S. companies have raised more than $9.4 billion from venture capital. But the lack of diversity in digital health leadership furthers the likelihood of creating solutions that worsen already existing health disparities. If we are truly going to transform health care, we must address this problem head on and with eyes wide open.\n\nTo drive meaningful change, it\u2019s important to understand where we are today. In early 2020, I partnered with Rock Health on a Diversity in Digital Health initiative to measure the baseline state of racial and ethnic diversity among U.S. digital health startup leadership teams. Between July and September 2020, we surveyed more than 650 founders and leaders. This was in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has tragically highlighted the health disparities experienced by communities of color, and the Black Lives Matter social justice movement, which has shone a spotlight on the systemic racism causing these disparities.\n\nThough the results of the survey were as expected in some areas, they indicated opportunities to improve across the board.\n\nThe survey showed significant differences in how digital health founders across different races, ethnicities, and genders funded their companies:\n\n  \u2022 More than half of white and Asian founders were backed by venture capital, compared to 24% of Black founders.\n  \u2022 Black founders were more likely to have bootstrapped their companies than their white and Asian counterparts.\n  \u2022 Black founders were more likely to be from the South (38%) and Midwest (20%) than from the West (4%) and Northeast (9%), the two regions in which the Rock Health Digital Health Funding Database shows capital concentration. For example, the average digital health deal size (from January through September 2020) was $36 million in the West versus $20 million in the South. This suggests Western founders are accessing more capital than their counterparts in the South, where there is much greater Black representation.\n\nThe survey also revealed a lack of people of color among leadership teams. Compared to their representation among the U.S. population, Asians were overrepresented in digital health (20% of survey respondents compared to 6% of the population), while Black leaders (8% of respondents compared to 13%) and Hispanic leaders (6% of respondents compared to 19%) were underrepresented.\n\nThere was also greater non-white diversity among company founders than among other leadership roles, with less Asian, Black, and Middle Eastern representation among non-founder leaders.\n\nDigital health entrepreneurs surveyed reported different challenges and experiences. Black leaders reported more difficulty accessing capital than their white or Asian counterparts. And 83% of Black respondents indicated that inclusion in the digital health industry has stayed the same or worsened since they started working \u2014 compared to less than half of white respondents saying that.\n\nNow is the time for digital health to get diversity right\n\nThe convergence of accelerating technology adoption with an unprecedented public health crisis is rapidly reshaping our health care systems. If we don\u2019t intentionally use this moment to diversify digital health leadership, we lose out on an opportunity to make health care better for everyone. You can\u2019t build the future of health care without understanding exactly what\u2019s wrong with its past and present \u2014 or without those who have been left out of the ranks of leadership.\n\nFor now, I am still the unicorn in most digital health settings. But it shouldn\u2019t take referencing a mythical creature to define my presence and identity in the digital health space. By establishing a data-driven baseline, we open the door to conversations that can lead to increased support for entrepreneurs of color and new innovation to meet the needs of diverse communities. If we commit ourselves to digging deeper on why these discrepancies exist and how we can address them, I believe we can leave the unicorn reference where it belongs, in stories of myth and fantasy.\n\nIvor Horn is an angel investor with Pipeline Angels and Portfolia\u2019s Rising America Fund, a pediatrician, former professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and former chief medical officer at Accolade.

        "text":"2 Month Update\n\nIts been almost 2 months since I have had Moh\u2019s surgery. I feel like I have been through hell and back, but it\u2019s done. I am starting to have shooting pains in my cheek, so I believe that the nerves are starting to grow back together now. Its still somewhat numb and I have a wonky smile. But you know what? I don\u2019t have cancer on my nose anymore. And for that, I am genuinely thankful.\n\nI think that I have come a long way in just two months. It will take about a year until its fully settled, in. At that time, my surgeon and I will make a decision about any revisions that need to be done.\n\nI really thought that I was going to be so much more self-conscious than I am about it. I had it covered under a bandage for so long that when I was finally at the end of using the bandages, I was happy to be done. I had great fun packing up all the first aid tape and bandages into a shoebox and labeling it \u201cDamn Cancer Box.\u201d The chances are pretty good I will get another one within 5 years, so at least now, I am ready for it. And I am not scared. And as for leaving the scar out to the open, who cares what anyone else thinks? I can honestly say that if someone wants to stare, go for it. I can make you feel just as uncomfortable. \ud83d\ude09\n\nSo, now that I am at this point in healing, I am just using a good skin care regimen (Roden & Fields Sensitive) and keeping my face as clean as I can. I am using a scar gel named Cicatricure on the nose and cheek. Hopefully, it will help. And as always, sunscreen. Although I will say that I have an intense fear of the sun now. I am sure that will pass, but for now, I am a shadow walker. LOL! \ud83d\ude09\n\nSo, that is basically all for now. I am good, my skin is good, and God is good. All the time.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
