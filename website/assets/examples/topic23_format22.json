Ask any local: the best way to experience Saskatoon \u2013 including the downtown core, the many parks, and numerous attractions along the river \u2013 is via the super-scenic Meewasin Trail.\n\nThe variety-filled trail, which traverses the river for 25 kilometres, has something for everyone: zoos, heritage sites, conservation areas, spray parks, bridges, weirs, shopping, riverside cafes, food trucks, art galleries, ice cream stands, farmer\u2019s markets, and the list goes on and on!\n\nRead the story\n\nOne-day journey Toggle Arrow\n\nPhoto: Andrew Penner\n\n\nStart your day the right way with a great cup of coffee at the Saskatoon Farmer\u2019s Market. This is a great place to begin your journey. The market is located downtown (just a block from the trail) near the corner of Idylwyld Drive and 9th Street. And whatever your go-to morning beverage happens to be \u2013 an Americano, Espresso, Latte or something else \u2013 Maduro, a small craft roaster, never disappoints. For more information on the market vendors and to check hours visit the Saskatoon Farmer\u2019s Market website.\n\nWhile walking the Meewasin Trail is definitely a popular way to go, pedalling the trail is highly recommended. You can rent bikes at a few locations, including Escape Sports and Bike Universe, both located near the market. The market is also just a block away from River Landing, where you can park your car in the new underground parkade.\n\nIf you\u2019re biking, your world is going to expand in terms of where you can go and how far you can travel. (Not a bad thing on a one-day \u201ctour\u201d along a lengthy Trail section with many, many options!)\n\nAfter coffee, head north on the Trail and you will cruise through the tidy trails and gardens along River Landing. This is a beautiful new development, which is home to theaters, art galleries, restaurants, shops, and a brand new condo complex. Spend some time exploring this cool, contemporary area or you can also save it for when you return.\n\nKeep traveling north and you will enter the pristine downtown section of the Trail, which meanders beside the historic Delta Bessborough Hotel (a historic landmark of the city) and provides easy access to the downtown core. If you steer your way to the front of the hotel, on the opposite side of the street, you\u2019ll find Bus Stop Refreshments, a classic Saskatoon eatery that operates out of a double-decker red bus (think London). Chow down on a hot dog or a delicious milkshake!\n\n\nPhoto: Andrew Penner\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed this itinerary fairly closely you\u2019ve no doubt eaten up a bit of time and haven\u2019t traveled very far. So now it\u2019s time to put on a few miles! Keep heading north up the Trail and enjoy the peaceful ambiance of the river. Stop to view the giant American White Pelicans that will be hanging out at the weir, waiting for lunch to swim over the wall of water.\n\nKeep pedaling past Kinsman Park and head to the Capilano Lookout for a beautiful view of the Meewasin Valley. But don\u2019t stop long! You\u2019ve got another hour of smooth cycling to reach the Wanuskewin Heritage Park, one of the top attractions in the region.\n\nThe park, which is Canada\u2019s longest running archaeological site, offers interpretive programs, guided walks, traditional dance performances, Indigenous cuisine, gift shops, art galleries, and much more. (And, of course, if the 10-kilometre bike ride to Wanuskewin is too long, no worries, you can always drive there if you prefer.)\n\nOn your return trip, a well-deserved dinner-on-the-patio at Drift (located just across the street from the Farmer\u2019s Market) is a great way to cap off your adventure. Before dinner, sip a pint of local craft beer (anything from Nokomis Craft Ales will hit the spot) and rehash your incredible day on the Meewasin Trail \u2013 truly one of the gems on The Great Trail of Canada.\n\n\nGetting there\n\nFly to\u00a0John G. Diefenbaker International Airport, which is located just 10 minutes from downtown Saskatoon. The city can also be accessed by rail, bus and via major highways.\n\nAndrea Lafond, CEO of the Meewasin Valley Authority\n\n\u201cFor the people who grew up here, this is Saskatoon. This is why we love to live here. And, depending on your interests and what you like to do, you\u2019re going to find it along the river. There is something for everyone.\u201d",

        "text":"Transatlantic cruises are both a journey and a holiday, offering many forms of entertainment, as well as opportunities for rest and pampering. Here are a few tips to help you make the most of your transatlantic voyage.\n\nChoose your perfect voyage\n\nWith so many options available, it\u2019s easy to find the cruise that will suit you best. Many offer the chance to visit different ports along the way, with the possibility of guided tours and other activities. If you\u2019re planning to travel onwards, look out for shorter cruise opportunities to take you further on your journey, or use your voyage as a jumping-off point to explore a new country.\n\n\nPlan ahead\n\nBefore you start your journey, it\u2019s a good idea to familiarise yourself with your ship\u2019s many diversions. You\u2019ll discover different activities to partake in, performances to see, and leisure facilities to enjoy. Whether you want to dance the night away or relax in the sun with a tall drink and a good book, you\u2019ll find a range of pastimes to keep you busy.\n\n\nOnce you know how you want to spend your time on board, it\u2019s time to pack your bags. It\u2019s a good idea to include at least one or two formal outfits for dinner, along with casual clothes for visiting ports, sportswear and swimwear. You\u2019ll need comfortable deck shoes for getting around the ship, and don\u2019t forget to take a warm, waterproof jacket in case the weather turns. If you plan to spend your week in a deckchair with a good book, check and see if your ship has a library to save you a little space in your suitcase.\n\n\n\nCruise ships offer many opportunities for rest and relaxation, from spas and beauty treatments to comfortable deckchairs with ocean views. If your cruise is part of a longer journey, take the time to relax as you sail from coast to coast. One of the major advantages of taking a transatlantic voyage rather than flying is the elimination of jet lag, as you have more time to adjust to the time difference before you arrive.\n\nEnjoy the night life\n\nCruise ships generally provide a wide range of evening entertainment, from formal dinners and musical performances, to illusionists and entertaining passenger contests. Take a look at your ship\u2019s schedule to see what\u2019s on, or be spontaneous and visit the bars to meet your fellow passengers.\n\n\nFine dining\n\nYou can expect to try some top-quality food on board, from buffets and oyster bars to cocktail snacks and formal dinners. Cruise ships are known for their food, so make the most of it and enjoy yourself!\n\nStay fit and watch the calories!\n\nYou\u2019ll find a range of sporting facilities on board, from running tracks and swimming pools to climbing walls and gyms, depending on the ship you take. You\u2019ll also find exercise classes to join, not to mention dancing in the evening. It\u2019s easy to overindulge on the many delicious delicacies that the crew will serve, but adding a little daily exercise to your routine will allow you to enjoy them without finding your waistband has tightened when you dock.\n\nWhatever your interests, transatlantic cruises have something for everyone. A little planning can help you get the best out of your trip, and build memories that will last a lifetime.",

Memories that have inspired the creation of museums, shows and exhibitions. The journey begins in Rovereto and ends in Trento, passing through Monta Zugna and Monte Pasubio along the way. You will walk, sleep in mountain huts, observe the stars, eat in a farmhouse and even be able to hop on an e-bike to visit the forts.\n\n\n1st Leg\n\nYour journey begins in the town of Rovereto where you can pay a visit the Italian War Museum: one of the main Italian museums dedicated to the First World War. Exhibits include everyday objects, documents and relics. The museum is also dedicated to the promotion of exhibitions and research and hosts a number of lively educational activities.\nYou can\u2019t miss a visit to the Bell of the Fallen on the Colle di Miravalle, cast from the bronze of the cannons used by nations on both sides of the conflict. It is the largest bell in the world that is rang at full peal. Every evening at sunset, its 100 tolls evoke a sense of universal peace.\nFrom here you can reach the Rifugio Monte Zugna mountain hut (at 1,616 metres), located on the mountain of the same name and which staged the important resistance of Italian troops to an Austrian offensive in 1916. Not far from the hut, you can admire the stars at the Astronomical Observatory of the Civic Museum Foundation of Rovereto. The route can easily be covered on foot, following part of a stretch of the Peace Trail.\n\n2nd Leg\n\nThe second day is dedicated to a visit to the Fort of Pozzacchio in Trambileno. The last Austro-Hungarian fort to be built in Trentino, dug out of living rock, strategically commands the upper Vallarsa valley. However, it was never completed due to the outbreak of the war.\nIn late morning we suggest you make your way up Monte Pasubio. This area was scene to many events during the conflict and has an evocative force all of its own, so much so that it is considered \u201csacred\u201d and has become one of the most significant and tragic symbols of the Great War.\nYou can park your car in the Giazzera area and start your walk towards the Rifugio Lancia\u00a0mountain hut at 1,825 metres. We recommend a tasty break at the Malga Zocchi farmhouse where you can try out some delicious ricotta dumplings.\n\n3rd Leg\n\nThe next morning, head back down to the valley and pick up your car. Make your way towards Serrada and then onto Lavarone (47 km) where you can visit Belvedere Fort. It is one of the largest fortifications of the First World War in Trentino and now hosts a museum with relics and multimedia exhibits that recount the history of the complex.\nIn the afternoon, moving over to Folgaria, you can rent an e-bike and take the Tour of the Forts:\na spectacular itinerary through the Austro-Hungarian fortifications of the Folgaria Alps. You can visit Fort Dosso delle Somme, make your way up to Forte Sommo Alto, the Rifugio Stella d\u2019Italia mountain hut and Sommo Pass before making your way back to Folgaria where you can spend the night.\n\n4th Leg\n\nThe next morning hop in your car and make your way to Trento. This capital city was considered extremely important, both strategically and politically, by the Austro-Hungarian High Command and not surprisingly was also one of Italy\u2019s main objectives during the War.\nEven today, besides the fortifications, the city hosts numerous places of great historical importance such as the\u00a0Buonconsiglio Castle, seat of the Austrian Military Tribunal.\nIn the late afternoon you can admire the city from a unique point of view: take the cable car up to Sardagna and enjoy an aperitif at Trento Alta.",

Research on the organization you will be working with \u2013 background checking is important before partnering with them. Is there an available translator for easier communication?\n\nResearch the country you are visiting.\nKnow all the issues it faces. Read so you will have a grasp of their unique culture. You don\u2019t want to be stepping on their norms and end up being rude and disrespectful. Get in touch with previous volunteers- they can give you first hand feedback.\n\nSee if your skills are good fit.\nAlways gauge whether your skills match the needs of the project and the community. This ensures you will be productive and the community will benefit from your stay. Keep in mind that not all projects require skills \u2013 the benefit you may be bringing is the funding to get a need met, such as a house for a needy family.\n\nGet out there and get dirty.\nShake it! Let loose. Get out of your comfort zone and reach out! Take time to interact with and get to know the locals you are working with, hear their stories, gain insights into their lives. Immerse yourself in the richness and uniqueness of the culture. You can learn from them.\n\nGive even more.\nIt\u2019s amazing to help alongside with the locals, but donating money beyond the funds needed for your project helps do even more good.\n\nThe Don\u2019ts\n\nDon\u2019t assume you already know it all.\nNo, you don\u2019t. Learn thoroughly before you begin embarking on the project. Learn how to use the hammer, saw, all the tools before starting on your building project.\n\nDon\u2019t just give away things.\nGiving things away may encourage begging, and providing a community with things without involving them can foster dependency. It is fantastic to bring items for donation, but give them to your partner organization so they can distribute them properly (and ask them for what it is best to bring).\n\nA voluntourism trip can be a bit daunting.

There is no RV water access at Indian Cove.) \u00a0Operating in \u2018better to be safe than sorry\u2018 mode, it\u2019s wise to plan ahead\u00a0and bring at least two gallons of water per person, per day for your trip to Joshua Tree.\n\nSpeaking of being prepared, it might also be wise to read up on the wildlife that inhabits this national park considering the likelihood of encountering something. \u00a0Knowing what to do, or not to do, could prove to be valuable information when taking into account that mountain lions, coyotes, bobcats, bighorn sheep, mule deer, scorpions, and a multitude of rodents and reptiles, including 18 varieties of lizards and 25 varieties of snakes, all dwell in this desert setting. \u00a0While sightings of any of these creatures (most of which are harmless) make for amazing photographs and stories to take home to family and friends, certainly an experience with a mountain lion or rattlesnake could be quite dangerous. So make sure you have plans for where to store your food, and what to do to stay safe.\n\nThere are no hookups for RVs at any campground in Joshua Tree. Black Rock and Cottonwood Campgrounds have RV-accessible potable water and dump stations. At Hidden Valley and White Tank Campgrounds, RVs and trailers may not exceed a combined maximum length of 25 feet.\nFor more information, you can contact National Park Service\n\n\nLead Photo Source: Joshua Tree National Park Public FB Profile\n\nYou may also like",
