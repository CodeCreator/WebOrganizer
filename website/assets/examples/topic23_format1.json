Life has a way of taking away your time. I have been so busy my little blog has suffered. Anyway, why Charlston? well there has been a lot of buzz about the new culinary scene in this southern city, plus I had heard so much about the history of this old town and seen dozens of photos of picturesque streets and the colorful houses that my curiosity was absolutely peeked. Therefore when the opportunity arose I boarded a plane for a quick 3 day discovery trip.\nContinue Reading\n\n\nCovent Garden, London\n\nStreet artist in Covent Garden, London\nNeal's Yard sign in Covent Garden\nPeople people people that is Covent Garden. The touristy shopping and dining meca in London\u2019s West End, at the heart of London\u2019s theater land. This neighborhood with the quaint side streets, indoor market, great boutiques and bistro\u2019s, entertaining street performers, old pubs and a general carnival atmosphere attracts hordes literally hordes of people from all over the world. I recently spent a day in London while visiting family in Wales and I chose to spend most of my limited time in the city in Covent Garden. I have traveled to many parts of the world but London remains my favorite city, for me it has everything, it is livable, pretty, exciting and fun. During this brief visit there was not enough time spent to write a travel guide but if you are looking for travel ideas then maybe these images of Covent Garden will convince you to visit London, one of the best cities in the world.\nContinue Reading\n\n\nLiz Klafata \u2013 founder of hospitality and design company Bangtel\n\nLiz Klafata founder of Bangtail\nWhen I owned a clothing boutique I worked briefly with Liz Klafata, who is a stylist and worked part time at the boutique. Liz became very busy and left to pursue her full time job. I did not see Liz for a couple of years until last year when I read in a local paper about Liz renovating and renting out properties in Chicago and starting her own rental company. Firstly, the article caught my attention because it was Liz and I knew her and it was exciting to read about someone I know. Secondly as I rent properties almost everywhere I go, I was excited to know more about the rental properties. I recently googled Liz and came across her company website In a word AMAZING. Bangtel properties are stunningly designed apartments that I just want to move into. I reached out to Liz and it was great to re-connect. I found out more about her exciting new venture. Liz was kind enough to give a fantastic interview.\nContinue Reading\n\n\nCatherine Scott \u2013 Beauty Entrepreneur\n\nView More:\nLast December just before I was due to go to Hawaii I was contacted by Catherine Scott who told me about an eye gel she had developed and a company she had set up called Honest Hazel. Catherine sent me some samples and I tried the product on my trip to Hawaii. Basically the products are especially designed gel strips that are placed under the eyes. I found the gel strips had an immediate cooling effect on the skin. After 20 minutes the skin under my eyes looked less puffy and felt refreshed.\nContinue Reading\n\n\nStrolling in Soho, New York\n\nI had not been to New York for years and I was overjoyed to be spending the three day Presidents day weekend in New York, one of my favorite cities. The weather gods have been good to us this winter. Temperatures have been mild, snow and rain minimal, weather wise there really has not been a lot to complain about. Therefore, it was bad luck that the weekend we decided to go to New York was the coldest weekend of the winter season. Temperatures were well below freezing, making it impossible to spend any length of time outside.\nContinue Reading\n\n\nOahu, Hawaii\n\nsurfinginbluesea, Oahu\nBeach, Ohau\nIsland off kokohead Mountain, Ohau\nThis post is part 2 of my Hawaii write up, part 1 is here. After spending the first week of our 2 week vacation in Honolulu we drove out of the city and moved into a rented cottage on Lanikai beach on the east coast of Oahu. There are a couple of things Lanikai is particularly famous for. Firstly, having one of the best beaches in the US and secondly, being the beach community that is down the street from Kailua where President Obama rents a vacation home for his winter holidays every year.\nContinue Reading\n\n\nHonolulu, Hawaii\n\nWaikiki Beach\nWaikiki harbor\n\nA belated Happy New Year everyone. Thank you all for reading this blog and following along with my travels \u2013 you all inspire me to keep posting and I hope I give you some ideas to add to your travel bucket list. I am looking forward to many more adventures in 2016 and I hope you will join me.\nDuring the Christmas holiday season we were lucky enough to go to paradise for some rest and relaxation. I am talking about Hawaii, one of the most gorgeous places on earth. This is our third trip to Hawaii; we had previously visited Maui, Kuai and Big Island. This trip was our first time in Oahu. We spent the first week in Honolulu, the capital of Hawaii and the only real city in the islands.\nContinue Reading\n\n\nSnoqualmie Falls \u2013 Washington\n\nThanksgiving this year was a family affair in the great city of Seattle. As with all holiday gatherings plenty of food and drink was consumed, plenty of netflicks watched and there was hours upon hours of conversation and laughter. However, when it was time to opt outside we took a trip to Snoqualmie Falls. A stunning 268ft waterfall on the Snoqualmie River about 40 miles from Seattle.\nLiving in an urban jungle like Chicago, waterfalls are not something I see very often. I find waterfalls exotic and exciting. I love to hear the thundering noise and see the mist rise up when the water hits the ground with force. These falls were especially beautiful on the day we visited because a frost had covered the ground creating a silver picture postcard effect on the river banks. Despite the cold temperatures it was a gloriously sunny day making the colors of the evergreen trees look lush. The entire scene was a sight to behold.\n\n\nIndiana Dunes\n\nRemembering how we all enjoyed the trip we did over the summer to Starved Rock state park. I really wanted to venture on another day trip outside Chicago, this time to see the beautiful colorful autumn leaves. Unfortunately work commitments, life commitments and rainy weather all combined to delay this trip. Continue Reading\n\n\nFallen Leaves\n\nAre the trees near where you live bare yet? are the fallen leaves forming a carpet on the sidewalk ?\nHere in Chicago quite a few of the trees in the city are still in bloom, this may have something to do with the unseasonably warm autumn we have been having. Don\u2019t get me wrong I like that the summer weather has decided to stick around. Winter can stay away as long as it wants, however something about November days being 70 degrees is not right. I will admit that right now I would not mind being cozy in some cashmere, pulling on some boots and tying a bright scarf around my neck. When I tell folks this the response is the same \u201cdon\u2019t worry, this is Chicago, the cold is coming, it\u2019s coming\u201d",
