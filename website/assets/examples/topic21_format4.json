        "text":"Nets Take Laughingstock Title Away From\u00a0Knicks\n\nVIDEO: The Knicks thump the Nets in a 30-point win\n\nBROOKLYN \u2014 As the Brooklyn Nets and New York Knicks accumulated a surprisingly sad 8-26 cumulative record, it became abundantly clear that neither team could defend to save its season. Entering Thursday\u2019s matchup of the busted boroughs, the Knicks ranked 28th defensively and the Nets ranked 30th.\n\nOnly one of the two teams took advantage of this fact, and the Knicks ran away with a 113-83 victory at Barclays Center, ending their nine-game losing streak.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carmelo Anthony said his team was \u201cthe laughingstock of the league.\u201d But 24 hours later, they\u2019ve been stripped of that title.\n\nThe Nets have the worst 3-point defense in the NBA, allowing their opponents to shoot 40.3 percent from beyond the arc entering Thursday\u2019s game. They\u2019re slow and deliberate on both ends of the floor, but really lack the foot speed to help in the paint and then recover to the 3-point line. So it only takes a dribble drive or a ball reversal for their opponent to get an open look from the outside.\n\nThe Knicks knew this, moved the ball and fired away on Thursday, hitting a season-high 16 threes on 27 attempts. Anthony (six assists and only 12 shots) shared the ball, Iman Shumpert (5-for-7 from 3-point range) shot with confidence, and the Knicks looked like the team they were last season, when they set an NBA record for 3-point makes and attempts, ranked third in offensive efficiency, and racked up 54 wins.\n\nAgainst the league\u2019s third-worst defense, the Nets should have been similarly efficient. With Andrea Bargnani and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire as two of their three rotation bigs, the Knicks have consistently been torched on pick-and-rolls this season, often escorting opposing ball-handlers to the basket.\n\nYet the Nets went a good 10 minutes of the first quarter without running a pick-and-roll once. They too often tried to run their offense through the post, which allowed Bargnani and Stoudemire to stay stationary. The few times they did make those guys move, they got good shots.\n\nPart of that is coaching. Though Brook Lopez led all scorers with 24 points, the Nets\u2019 offense could have been a lot more effective as a whole if he was catching the ball on the move more than in the post. Jason Kidd has to find a way to get the ball and his players moving offensively. It\u2019s far too early to say that hiring him was a mistake, but we\u2019ve seen enough to say that he\u2019s not a very good coach right now.\n\nInjuries are obviously an issue. The Nets are still without Deron Williams, by far their biggest threat off the dribble. With Williams sitting out for the 10th time in the last 11 games, point guard duties were again left to Shaun Livingston and Tyshawn Taylor. Livingston is athletic, but not all that quick. Taylor is quick, but shaky and inexperienced.\n\nStill, Brooklyn could have run more pick-and-rolls with both, or with Joe Johnson, and just tried to make the New York defense move. They didn\u2019t and they lost by 30.\n\nBoth Kidd and Kevin Garnett cited the injuries when discussing their struggles after the game. Garnett added that the Nets are making changes in the wake of Lawrence Frank\u2018s sudden departure from the bench.\n\n\u201cThose things play a big part into this,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer when we\u2019re whole and we have our team full throttle, then that\u2019s what I believe in. Obviously, I believe in the guys that\u2019s put on the floor and we\u2019re going to give it an effort, but when you\u2019re playing teams, you want to play at your whole. That\u2019s what I believe in. And I\u2019m not going to believe anything else until we are whole.\u201d\n\nBefore the game, Kidd said that \u201cwe all feel confident we have enough to win.\u201d After the game, he asked not to be judged until his team is healthy.\n\n\u201cI think you get evaluated by being whole,\u201d he said. \u201cIt starts there. And then once that occurs, then you\u2019re evaluated. That\u2019s as simple as it gets.\u201d\n\nYes, the Nets are missing four of their top eight guys. And Williams\u2019 importance became even more clear on Thursday. But the Nets still lost at home \u2026 by 30 points \u2026 to a team that hadn\u2019t won in three weeks and is missing its most important player. The injury excuse only goes so far. And while Williams will help the Brooklyn offense, the defense isn\u2019t going to start looking like that of the Heat upon his return.\n\nTyson Chandler\u2019s eventual return isn\u2019t going to solve all New York\u2019s problems either. The Knicks are still a long way from digging out of the hole they\u2019ve dug for themselves, especially because they don\u2019t get to play the Nets again until Jan. 20. But they do have a relatively soft schedule over the next two weeks and certainly found some confidence Thursday.\n\nWill that translate into a run up the standings? Even if it doesn\u2019t, at least they\u2019re not the laughingstock of the league anymore.\n\n\n  1. justsayin says:\n\n    If they really want to salvage their season they need to get Hollins on the bench and Kidd on the court.\n\n  2. PalmOil Preference says:\n\n    As a Knick fan still very disappointed in my team. The fact we only have one more win then the Bucks says it all.\n\n    As far as laughingstocks KG is hilarious. \u201cI don speak Italian\u201d priceless response.\n\n    As far as the Knicks we live and die by the 3 so until we get some type of flow on offense this team will continue to pile on the losses. Prigioni and Udrih should get more clock at the point spot. Beating a bang up nets team was just good to sees victory but my concerns are for real with this team.\n\n  3. ant says:\n\n    I don\u2019t understand why they dont have their lineup be\n\n    PG- Deron\n    SG- Joe\n    SF -Anderson\n    C \u2013 Lopez\n\n    Then have pierce come off the bench for scoring and use garnett as liability since hes not scoring or defending.\n\n  4. nbafan says:\n\n    Kidd is gonna be a good coach, the ones who dont see this, doesnt understand basketball, i must say\u2026with this roster, and with these available players, this record is the rality. I mean, johnson is not a star player anymore, but still thinks he is\u2026garnett is a joke. pierce still has some game, but constantly injured, not to mention deron and kirilenko (who would be their elit defender). Lets face it: livingston, taylor, alan anderson, blatche, plumlee\u2026they have to play big minutes, and they are not better than this 5-14 record. So its nothing to do with Kidd.\n\n    IF its ever gonna be a healthy Deron-Joe-Pierce-Garnett-Lopez with Terry, Kirilenko and Blatche from the bench, this team are going to win ballgames, and have a chance to be an elit team in the east.\n\n  5. JimD54 says:\n\n    I think D Williams is a decent player but the Nets need to find a good healthy point guard, Williams stays on sick leave too much, and you can\u2019t build a team around a part time player, look what he did to Utah, in this league you need a good dependable point guard to run your team and D Will ain\u2019t it\u2026..\n\n  6. eck says:\n\n    Kid is a joke as a coach. The Nets should know that not all great point guards could coach. Remember Magic Johnson or Isaiah Thomas to name a few. With a bunch of veteran superstars, they should be above the 0.500 mark. Better rethink about another coach or be the biggest disappoint of the season\u2026\n\n  7. Big O says:\n\n    Who\u2019s that horrible commentator on today\u2019s videos\u2026 just annoyingly annoying!\n\n  8. NotSoFast says:\n\n    It is a bit rough to say the Nets with 5 Wins are the laughingstock of the league when FOUR teams have less wins than them and THREE teams have only 6 Wins.\n\n    That\u2019s 8 teams that one could say deserve being called the laughingstock of the league.\n\n    \u2022 mee(a)t says:\n\n      Its because of who\u2019s in this team. A team with HOFers and all stars alone would be expected to be a legit title contender. Yeah chemistry issues are a concern but to perform so horribly\u2026last year Lakers wasn\u2019t even this bad.\n\n    \u2022 justsayin says:\n\n      It\u2019s not news when teams you expect to be bad are bad. When you go deep into the luxury cap with one of the highest payroll ever in the nba \u2013 to buy whats supposed to be a championship contender \u2013 and underperform like this? Sorry but that\u2019s \u201cpicture in encyclopedia\u201d definition of laughingstock.\n\n  9. Drago says:\n\n    The Nets really have a bad couch and they are out of luck with injuries but they should have won at least 4 more games considering their roster.The Kniks are a bad team because Carmelo is not Brayant or Lebron he doesnt pull his teammates he just plays his game.\n\n  10. Wildcat23 says:\n\n    Surely Kidd would know some motion offenses to get his team moving and not so stagnant.\n    I mean you could run a UCLA 1-4 or a flex with some stagger options, horns even! Get defenders out of the paint, use the roll options and then go to the post if all else fails.\n\n  11. okc2014 says:\n\n    Correction: The Knicks are not the laughing stock of the NBA. The Knicks, Nets, Bucks, Kings and Jazz are the laughing stock of the NBA.\n\n  12. boston rules says:\n\n    The laughing stock of the nba has to be either the knicks, nets or the jazz. People wise, it would be jason kidd because he thinks he\u2019s good at management when he really isnt. Spills drink on the court and gets fined 50k, was it really worth it? no hope both new york and brooklyn never make playoffs. melo will move to heat because mainly of bandwagon like half the nba\n\n  13. Sharpie says:\n\n    I can understand why the Nets aren\u2019t any good. They threw a guy onto the coaches seat who has absolutely no experience. It\u2019s pretty bad when your best move as a coach is spilling your soda on the floor. Kevin Garnett is a joke and needs to retire. It seems like every time I watch him play he gets physically and mentally owned by these younger players (maybe he should wear his headphones during the game.) Plus their PG is injured. However there is no excuse for the Knicks. Yes Chandler is out but Melo is more talented and has a better team around him than all but 2 or 3 teams in the entire Eastern Conference. I\u2019m neither a Kni... (truncated)",

Just a few weeks ago I was thinking it would be crazy to trade Savard when I saw someone mention it but now I'm not so sure.\n\nIf Savard does have more value than Kaberle there could be additional pieces thrown in by both sides I guess.\n\nSay for instance the Bruins want to trade Ward or Ference. I know Burke was quoted as saying that the Leafs could afford to take on salary in trades.\n\nSo maybe it goes something like this (if Savard has more value?)\n\nBruins get\n\nKaberle 2 years at 4.25 cap number\nPonikarovsky 1 year at 2.105 cap number\n\nLeafs get\n\nSavard -- 1 year at 5 million\nSturm or Ward -- 2 years at 3.5 million or 1 year at 2.5 million\nBruins 1st 09' #28 or 29\n\n*Sturm has a limited no trade clause I think (not sure if he would want or could be forced to go to Toronto)\n\nPlease be kind...I'm new at this sort of thing\n\nC77 is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote",
