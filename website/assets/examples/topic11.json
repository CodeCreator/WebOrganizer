        "text":"Apology from Mike Morhaime\n\nGeneral Discussion\nPrev 1 4 5 6 27 Next\nI am not involved in any of the blizzcon event, but from seeing the forums, this post was the right move instead of the post the band made earlier.\n\nFrom that earlier post, the band noted that everything was meant to be fun. While it might have been okay for some people, for others, it clearly indicated that blizzard as a company was acting completely different than the promises to provide an enjoyable experience for everyone.\n\nI am glad that the president himself did something like this, Kudos to you, Mr Morhaime. It makes me proud to be your customer. But I do hope that you folks at Blizzard learnt something from this lesson and not repeat it in the future.\nThanks, Bashiok! Or Mike, as it may be.\nThank you for the apology. We all make mistakes, and from them we learn. I am glad to hear that Blizzard was not dismissive of how the LGBT community in the game felt about the video.\n\nTogether in this all of us can move forward.\nThe apology was fine. In fact, the first apology was fine IMO, but whatever. Let's move on.\n\n<moving on...>\n\nSee,, said it wouldn't be enough.\n\nYou still have people not accepting the apology and demanding for people to get fired.\n\nSome will be upset that the wind was knocked out of their sails. They are the ones who want to be upset. Best to just ignore them and they will eventually deflate completely.\nPardon my skepticism, but I find it difficult to shrug off an intolerant tirade as an \"error in judgement\". That's a cop out. NOT dropping slurs such as those used the offending video is standard practice in any business in this country, and how any of you, presumed paragons of the video game industry, were stupid enough to let this happen is completely beyond me. Presumably there are rules which prohibit such language between Blizzard employees. Apparently, extending the same courtesy to your customer base is not a priority.\n\nFurthermore, I think it prudent to point out that were Sam Didier working in any other position at any other company in the world, he would have been fired in a heartbeat. I could only imagine the swift dismissal any one of us would receive were we to be seen next some homunculus putz who brazenly insults the greater portion of our employers' customers.\n\nI'm not demanding anyone's job, but this is a template, soulless, corporate apology if I've ever read one in my life.\n\nToo bad you don't work for blizzard, with all of your insight and wisdom.\n\nSeriously, people who actually took the corpsegrinder interview seriously need to stop playing games, and go read some books.\nIt's good to see an apology going out and I'm thankful for it. As I said elsewhere, part of what makes playing Horde fun is the whole \"Blood & Honor\" thing, and that incident simply lacked honor. Like honor on the field of battle, when you defeat your enemy you don't follow it up by t-bagging them. Leave that to those immature Halo players. ;)\nWell spoken, Mr. Morhaime.\nI do not wish to see anyone fired but learn to behave as a proper employee of a company when infront of the public\/customers.\n\nPeople are human and make mistakes but they need to learn from them.\nI accept your apology\n\ntwice now!\nAnyone who doesn't understand why it was offensive doesn't deserve to have it explained to them. Do you really not see how being gay, and then seeing someone use \"gay\" as an ugly insult to someone, is hurtful? If you're genuinely that unable to empathize with other human beings, you probably shouldn't be playing a multiplayer online game to begin with.\n\nMr. Morhaime, your apology is just what was needed and is accepted wholeheartedly at least by me. It's nice to see anybody in this day and age, especially a large company, actually say \"we messed up and we're sorry\" as opposed to the \"we're sorry you were offended\" most people hand out.\nI wasn't terribly offended by the video, but I greatly appreciate the apology from the big man of Blizzard himself.\n\nApology accepted, Mike. Now let's put this behind us and get to work on making the best WoW expansion ever.\n\nI'll be waiting for my Annual Pass beta key.\n\nThis isn't about being vindictive or petty. This is how you run a business. Employees that commit equal opportunity offenses either require retraining and\/or demotion or even termination. You don't just get off calling customers slurs, even via proxy.The fact that no one stopped and took a look at the video before it was shown implies negligence at a high level.\n\nThat being said. I know when enough is enough.\n\nThank you Mike.\nDid he say \"People that play alliance\" anywhere? No. He didn't. But everyone wanted to pretend like he did. But yeah. Enough is enough. Now you can go tell everyone how right you were, and this whole lame thing can be forgotten about like it should have the second it was done.\n\nNobody likes to be misunderstood. And maybe one day, you'll see that. And how wrong it is.\n\nForgive earnestly and whole heartedly, but never forget.\n10\/27\/2011 07:37 PMPosted by Lemuria\nI was thinking more of termination or at the very least demotion. Having someone like this run the name of your company through dirt is not good for business\n\nApology accepted Lord of the WoW but in return I must request that we Alliance have a special quest to slay and behead an npc named after Corpsegrinder (That or spawn the Lich King on him every time he logs on WoW).\nThank you.\n\nJoin the Conversation\n\nReturn to Forum",

        "text":"Sunday, October 23, 2016\n\nJuba I vs. The Legions of Rome\n\nMy honored followers we had a very special game day at Mike's house yesterday. Mike and his wife Mary served us cake to celebrate Mike's birthday and the announcement of his well deserved retirement from the railroad. Mike has had a life long involvement with trains starting with building them and lately, repairing them. On top of all of this it was the last game our this years campaign season.\n\nOur cast of characters was, Mike, Wendel, Ken, Bill, Phil and myself. Unfortunately Phil was called away and could not participate. So we had Wendel, Bill and Ken as the Generals of Rome and Mike and I commanded Juba's warriors of North Africa.\n\nSo here are some pictures of our initial set up.\nBelow we have the army of Juba I.\n\u00a0And below we have the army of Rome.\n\nThe Africans gained the initiative and decided to move first.\n\u00a0Where they promptly received some casualties from a Roman balista and a unit of archers.\nThe second turn saw the initiative move to Rome but they allowed Juba's army to move first. So we advanced again taking still more annoying missile hits.\n\nFinally we get to close for some good old hack and slash! and a mighty blood bath it was.\n\nJuba's troops moved steadily towards the Roman main line while the Romans were using a wait and see tactic. This allowed the Romans to inflict as many casualties as possible with their formidable missile units before closing into melee. In addition, this also cuts down the amount of room on the table preventing any troops that would be able to flank their line from having much space to work in while also buying more time to inflict casualties.\nWay up at the top of the above picture you can see Mike and Ken having at it with Mike trying to thrash Ken's cavalry so as to obtain a clear shot at the Roman left flank. Meanwhile Wendel and I are having at it on the Roman right flank as\u00a0 Iattempt do gain an advantage also.\nThe picture below shows Mikes success at crushing Ken's cavalry wetting up the chance to move on the Roman flank. Go Mike!!\n\u00a0Below on my flank I was having less success against Wendel and he was able to get some light cavalry and infantry past me. All this time Bill was directing traffic and annoying us with those damned missiles.\n\u00a0Another shot of Mike's advantage on this flank.\n\u00a0Finally the battle line collide and the butchering begins.\n\u00a0For four turns we traded blows but the Romans had the upper hand having bloodied us with the missile attacks while we were advancing.\n\u00a0And eventually Bill's tactic won the day for Rome.\nI have to say that Bill has used this ploy on many occasions and has won a number of games with it. Very clever Bill.\nSo Rome has won another battle and has added North Africa to the Empire.\u00a0\nCongratulations to Bill, Ken and Wendel!\nEven though we took it on the chin Mike and I had a great time also.\nHere again are some pictures of Mike's toys. I apologize for the quality of the pictures as my camera fu was off.\n\nThe figure below was painted by the very talented Paul Innes. Unfortunately my picture does this no justice. This figure is stunning in the flesh so to say.\n\n\u00a0So thanks s always for stopping by and I hope to have more in the near future. Good gaming,",

        "text":"Gathering of An Army\n\nChapter One\n\nFor a hundred years, the humans of the east have lived in segregated farming settlements and mercanary strongholds with nothing but their need to fend off the savage races binding them. They had no plans to unite their people \u2013 Survival was their only viable dream. Things began to change once they realized that an unsteady order had fallen back into place in the lands. Roads of communication opened between settlements and people began to travel once more. With the gnomes and halflings traveling from the south, the humans found themselves once more gaining a foothold in the world, after being hunted like game by the drow and other savage clans. Though they were not yet a nation. Still a divided people struggling and surviving in small groups, unable to trust any but those immediately around them.\n\nHowever, now a new development has caused the people to rally and finally unify their forces. Years ago, rumours came from the grey fields that the divided clans of the savage races had begun to form truces, one small group at a time. These gangs were managable since most of these races themselves had suffered great loses during the War of Many. None of them were at their same power as they were centuries ago. Thus far, the outlying villages had managed to fend off any attackers and even carved out territorial boarders running along the deserts and towards the grey fields.\n\nOnly months ago, a new and much greater danger arose. This evil showed its numbers when they began to raid camps in the south edge, quickly ravaging the people as they marched their army north towards the edge of the Vale. Rumors began to spread of a shadow stretching for as far as the eye could see, dotted with the eyes of demons. Notice went out throughout the lands that it was time for man to rise up once more and defend this world. Now it is the responsability of these fighters, warriors, and brave commonfolk to search out and chase down the evils destroying their hopes of eventually taking back their home from the savages and of building a great nation once again.\n\nChapter Two\n\nSent into the mountains by a military desperate for any hope of survival, a group of soldiers, an Oracle, and a random adventurer picked up along the way trekked across fields, wastelands, hills and mountains. They fought ogres, lions and a basilisk. They were forced to infiltrate the enemy army in order to rescue a kidnapped ally. Many of them beheld the soft glow of the afterlife, just before being dragged back to the material world. Others instead embrassed the warmth of the basking light. Along the way, they managed to find a couple other adventurers in need of partnership to assure their survival in this world.\n\nNow, on the other side of the Breach Mountains, a group of once strangers, who possibly never would have even chosen a seat next to the other in a bar, find themselves staring into an unknown forest and vast wilderness. Their previous goal \u2013 to stay alive \u2013 has been accomplished, but they now become aware that they are alone, with no allies and a possibly vast number of enemies, with no clear designation.\n\nChapter Three\n\nSoon after the main force of the Skaldernian army made its way into the vastness of the desert in pursuit of the Dark Army, the outlying villages and farms began to rebuild their settlements as people returned to their homes. However, they had little time to settle back in as a new, much more menacing threat swept across the fields. Like locusts, swashes of undead hordes came in waves, destroying the body of every man, woman and child that came within their reach. Hearing of this plague making its way across the country, the citizens of Skalderna began leaving their homes, en masse traveling to the relative safety behind the walls of Langen. So while the people\u2019s spirit rebounded against the power of the Master, they now had no choice but to cower and hope that something will save them from the current scourge.\n\nConvinced that this new threat was brought on by the powers of a powerful mage, or perhaps several working in league with this \u201cDark Master\u201d, the collective council (made up of the leaders of the largest cities within Skalderna) decided that once and for all magic must not just be shunned upon, but outlawed entirely. No longer would it simply carry a stigma and those cursed with its touch be outcasted; now they would be hunted and sentence brought against them for the crimes they had obviously committed, or to keep them from the horrors that they would eventually commit after being corrupted by their power. The council sanctioned witch hunters to seek out those who would practice the arcane, while the churches also provided their own inquisitors whom they had trained for similar situations.\n\nMeanwhile, the people of the Shoanti tribes within the ever-burning desert were in a similar situation. They found themselves in an unfortunate battle with the people whom they would hope to someday call ally. However, while the warriors are well equipped for battle and the shaman well versed in the rites of the dead, neither are prepared to battle with the dead. What was once the Skaldernian army tasked with hunting down the Dark Army had now transformed into a group marching on the people of the desert; their bodies now simply an empty husk. With this undead army encroaching on their territories, they have had no choice but to leave their home and find haven in the mountains. The decided that the best place for was where their spirits and ancestors could guide and protect them; Storval. The Elder lead them through the grounds, the maze-like pillars, plateaus, and valleys making it impossible for the army to follow them.\n\nFrom a distance, small pillars of white smoke can be seen coming from the crevasses of the Breach.\n\nYou can listen to our sessions at our website ( ) or directly through our RSS feed.\n\nWhy not follow us on Twitter with @DragonFisters or Like us on Facebook.\n\nGathering of An Army\n\nKiloGex Blog header 750 ReRow A_Trip_Alone octraine14 DFShade DFPepper Darksinister669 TRevorsaur",

She\u2019s an animal person, with a special love for dogs. Outside of work she\u2019s goofy and sarcastic, but at work she\u2019s the picture of professionalism.\n\nInterests:\u00a0Traci likes to sit and watch TV for hours on end\u2026or go for a hike. She likes a mix of the indoor and outdoor, and made it her goal this year to do more hiking. She also likes playing board games with friends.\n\nHer favorite Sporcle quizzes are in the genre of\u00a0Clickable 1-100 Mines\u00a0and the Spacebar Challenge. Also, she\u2019s a huge Walking Dead fan. (Our insider investigation found out that she\u2019s played \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 Episodes\u00a0quiz 6 times, with a 100% score.)\n\nStrange Fact:\u00a0After college Traci traveled to Guatemala where she lived and volunteered in an animal shelter for a month. In her words, she is \u201cweirdly obsessed with weird dogs.\u201d She volunteers at a Seattle animal shelter, and her favorite dogs are the neurotic, nervous dogs.\n\nHere at Sporcle:\u00a0Traci spends her time in numerous spreadsheets, handling financial reports and administrative tasks. As she puts it \u201ca lot of things come through me.\u201d\n\nFavorite thing about working at Sporcle: Traci likes that everyone works really hard, while maintaining their sense of humor.

        "text":"Story image\n\nGame review: The Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening on the Switch\n\n24 Sep 2019\n\n25 years after its original Game Boy release, Nintendo\u2019s classic\u00a0The Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening, has been reimagined for the Switch.\n\nFirst released way back in 1993 on Nintendo Game Boy, the game was reissued in 1999 for the Game Boy Color. With fresh graphics, yet again, Nintendo are bringing one of their classics to a new audience.\n\nHaving played videogames for forty years, I\u2019ve a lot of nostalgic memories of great games from yesteryear. Having revisited many of the games that defined my youth via emulation and reissues, I\u2019ve realised that my memory has a funny habit of upgrading video game graphics.\n\nLink\u2019s Awakening on Nintendo\u2019s Switch is as if the developers had taken my rose-tinted memory of the original Game Boy game and put it in my Switch. This is exactly what Link\u2019s Awakening and a thousand over copycat RPGs (especially you, Alundra) would have looked like if the tech was available back in the early 90s.\n\nAnyone familiar with retro RPGs will be right at home with Link\u2019s Awakening. Apart from the fresh visuals, the game retains all of the charm that made these games a staple of the videogame industry back in the day. The game starts with Link washed up on the beach of Koholint Island. On exploring the Mabe village, Link comes across an owl who tells him that he needs to wake the Wind Fish in order to get home. And to do this Link will need to find eight instruments hidden away in eight dungeons.\n\nLink\u2019s Awakening sits a little outside of the main Zelda series in that it doesn\u2019t take itself quite as seriously. Players expecting more of Link\u2019s adventures \u00e0 la Breath of the Wild may be disappointed (until they settle in to play it, that is).\n\nThe story comes about via the interaction with the locals and the tasks that they set Link. By Western standards it\u2019s a little odd, but typical JRPG-fayre. There\u2019s always something going on that Link needs to sort out. Players are never really left hanging.\n\nLink starts with nothing, not even the ability to jump. The island is set out full of obstacles blocking Link\u2019s path.\u00a0 As the game progress Link\u2019s equipment and abilities begin to slowly enable players to get to new areas and unlock new paths. Early in the game obtaining Link\u2019s sword enables him to get through vegetation blocking his path and hiding Rupees (the island\u2019s currency), heart and power-ups.\n\nTrading with the island\u2019s citizens will also allow Link to gain useful items. Listening to everybody you talk to will reveal what they need. There\u2019s also a trader (which you can actually steal stuff from) and a weird shop with one of those prize grabbers that you can try your luck on for a small fee.\n\nThe island is littered with infinitely spawning enemies which need to be avoided or dealt with. Link\u2019s sword and shield and later on arrows, and even a boomerang, do the job of keeping the nasties at bay.\n\nEach dungeon is full of puzzles that are fun and not too hard. I found the bosses to be a pain, but I\u2019m not much of a fan of these in any game and, unfortunately, in the 90s, when Link\u2019s Awakening was conceived, they were all the rage (and still are in most Japanese games).\u00a0\n\nAs with the original there were times when I was a bit flummoxed as to what I\u2019m supposed to do next. Back in \u201993 I had no internet, thankfully we no longer have to be stuck for days, be calling premium tip lines or waiting for magazine walkthroughs. Be prepared for a little frustration.\n\nAs old as it may be, Link\u2019s Awakening doesn\u2019t pull its punches. If you really get stuck, you can always use one of the phones in the gave and get a crafty tip from them. If it all gets too much, you can always chill out and do some fishing.\n\nWhether you play the game on your TV or via the Switch\u2019s screen, the game looks incredible. The developers have used a light tilt-shift-style blurring to the top and bottom of the screen to make the environment look like a little model. It looks great and super-cute.\n\nIf I didn\u2019t know better, it\u2019s as if The Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening was made for the Switch. This remaster is a perfect partner for Nintendo\u2019s portable console. It looks beautiful and is just so much fun to play.",
