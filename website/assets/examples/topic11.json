Attacking much like the Rot Grub (MF rules, page 93), a Computer Bug can easily bore through an android's outer skin layer. Once inside the robot's system, the Computer Bug will head straight for the AI's positronic CPU if not stopped immediately with an application of electricity at the site of the initial infestation. This shock will destroy the Bug, as well as inflict 1d6 hit points of damage per instance. If not stopped, the Computer Bug will reach the AI's CPU in 3d10 minutes and then begin consuming the crystalline matrix, which will instantly kill the host.\n\nMutations: none\n\nFriday, September 27, 2013\n\nGoing Postal -- Teflon Coating:Shield Options And Man In The Machine: Basic Androids\n\nJohn Buckley over at\u00a0The Knotty-Works\u00a0has released two new supplements for the\u00a0Mutant Future RPG! Both supplements are for his growing \"Going Postal\" series, which will present new supplemental rules and expansion to the core rules.\n\nTeflon Coating: Shield Options -- This issue covers shield options including typical post-apocalyptic gear that most fledgling wasteland adventurers would use; an optional combat mechanic; and some pre-apocalyptic powered shields that may be found in the crumbling ruins and deserted installations of those who lived before the world ended.\n\nMan in the Machine: Basic Androids -- \u00a0This issue covers android archetypes and options for the Basic Android. Three new archetypes are introduced, including a law enforcement model, a military model with specializations, and a medic response android. Four example androids are also introduced that may be used by the Mutant Lord to easily populate a crumbling mall, desolated sports arena, or the vestages of a massive battlefield.\n\nBoth PDFs are 99 cents\u00a0at Drive Through RPG!\n\nWednesday, September 25, 2013\n\nClassic RPG Map Dice Bag Available!\n\nWow! Michael Althauser (greyedout on Etsy) did a FANTASTIC job creating a new custom dice bag for me with the Classic RPG Map cloth pattern I designed at Spoonflower. It should be arriving sometime this week. Don't you wish you could get one too? Well, guess what! Michael has added this design to his dice bag shop, so now you can also order one of these Classic RPG Map dice bags of your very own! Only $20 plus shipping!\n\nSaturday, September 21, 2013\n\nDangerous Encounter: Skinning The Cat\n\nThis simple little encounter can turn very deadly very quickly for one (or more) of the PCs if they aren't cautious. While travelling, the PCs should see a large tree about 30 yards off the side of the road they're on. Sitting propped up at the foot of the tree is a humanoid skeleton. It's fairly easy to see the unmoving corpse, even at this distance. The PCs can throw things at the skeleton, shoot at it, yell, but the skeleton doesn't stir and nothing comes running out to ambush them.\u00a0\n\nWhen they get about 10 yards away from the skeleton, tell them that the body has flies and small insects swarming all over it, as it still has bloody strips of muscle and tissue still clinging to the bones, as if the corpse was slaughtered, stripped, and deposited here recently. There is a satchel laying next to the corpse as well, so whoever killed the victim didn't seem particularly interested in his belongings. At this point, the players are probably watching for the creature or animal that did this. What they may not figure out until it's too late is that the tree the skeleton rests against is also his killer.\n\nThe tree is a Skinner Tree (MF rules, page 95). Skinner Trees use their roots and vines to grab and hold a victim while numerous bladed and thorned vines flay and strip the flesh from them, depositing them into a hungry mouth in its trunk. When the victim is dead and all of the flesh is consumed, the Skinner Tree leaves the corpse nearby in hopes of attracting any hungry animals or scavengers. The unfortunate traveler decided to take a nap at the foot of the Skinner Tree and was flayed while he slept.\n\nSkinner Tree (1)\u00a0(AL C, MV 60' (20'), AC 4, HD 15, #AT 1 (skinning vines), DG 2d8, SV L5, ML 10,\u00a0mutations: prehensile tendrils, tripping tendrils, natural vegetal weapons, free movement)\n\nIf the party gets within 20 feet, the Skinner Tree's prehensile tendrils will whip out from the highest branches of the tree to try to grab and gold the PC. If successfully hit, the PC will take 2d6 of constriction damage while being held tightly. Meanwhile, the Tree's tripping tendrils will wriggle up out of the earth and will grapple their feet and legs to keep escape minimal. Any PC who is successfully grabbed will be dragged nearer the Skinner Tree where its sharp thorned vines wait to slice and dice the victim.\n\nThe Skinner Tree's bladed vines do 2d8 hit points of damage, and each hit strips a piece of the living victim's body flesh. If a victim is successfully flayed 5 times, he must make a save versus death on any further successful attacks. Failure means the victim dies of shock and blood loss. Any victim who is successfully flayed 10 times dies of shock and blood loss regardless of any remaining hit points he may have.\n\nIf the PCs manage to escape and\/or kill the Skinner Tree and retrieve the satchel, they may keep the 6 bottles of high-quality synthehol within (a trader would pay up to 50 gold pieces each for them) as well as the 665 gold pieces hidden in a secret pouch on the side.\n\nThursday, September 19, 2013\n\nGimme Five!\n\n...Five more followers, that is!\n\nI posted this exact same blog post back in 2011 when I was hovering at 195 followers for about a month. Now, The Savage AfterWorld is tantalizingly close to having 300 followers.

Thanks to everyone who joined this week, and thanks to everyone who's followed this blog over the years. Time to get back to the radium mines and deliver some content to you folks!\n\nWednesday, September 18, 2013\n\nDangerous Encounter: The Fungus Among Us\n\nNOTE: This encounter is best run with either one PC or perhaps a few party members while the others are on another quest or unavailable. This encounter could perhaps be played as a side trek or if the party gets split or separated. WARNING: If you run your\u00a0entire group through this encounter all at the same time, it could result in the deaths of all party members (which will become apparent as you read).\n\nWhile travelling down a little-used path, the PCs will notice that various molds, slimes, and fungi grow rampant. Mushrooms and toadstools line the path, and every tree is spotted with fungus. There is a musty smell in the air. While taking this in, have the PCs roll versus surprise. If they make it, they'll see that two of the fungus-covered figures by the side of the road are reaching out to grab them! \u00a0(If they miss the roll, the two figures get a surprise attack on them.) These two creatures are fungus-covered Shroombies -- dead creatures animated through a nefarious fungus that takes root and replaces their vital organs.\n\nShroombies (2)\u00a0(AL C, MV 90' (30'), AC 8, HD 5, #AT 2 (claw\/bite or poisonous spores), DG 1d6\/2d6, SV L4, ML 6,\u00a0mutations: metaconcert, poisonous spores (hallucinogenic))\n\nEerily silent, the Shroombies press their attack, clawing and biting in an attempt to bring down their victims. At several points during the attack, the Shroombies will use their poisonous spore attack, breathing out a cloud of greenish-grey spores into the faces of the PCs. Have the PCs roll a save versus poison, but regardless of the outcome, tell them there was no effect. (More on this in a moment.) Have the combat last until the Shroombies are (hopefully) defeated.\n\nOnce the combat has ended, the PCs will hear a voice behind them. Turning, they'll see a small girl standing in the path. \"'ve defeated them! Oh thank you! Thank you! You must come with me and tell the village of your victory!\" She'll run off down the path and, in the distance, the PCs can now hear music and laughter. If they follow her, the PCs will come to a small glade in the center of the fungus-filled forest. Here, they find a small village filled with what appear to be pure humans. They are warmly greeted as heroes and made to feel utterly welcome. The Mutant Lord should play up on the PCs egos. Anything they may want is provided by the village (\"As thanks for destroying the fungus menace!\"). No matter how suspicious they may be or how wary they are, everything appears on the level. Have the PCs actually discovered a haven?\n\nOf course not. It's all a lie. A fungus-fueled lie.\n\nThe Shroombies were lurking on the edge of a Fungal Grove, a dangerous gigantic fungal organism (MF rules, page 72). As the PCs approached the area, they were already becoming affected by the poisonous spores that float heavily in the air and cling to most surfaces. These poisonous spores have two effects: first, it triggers hallucinations in those affected, and second, it connects the minds of those affected in metaconcert. In other words, the PCs are now under a shared hallucination. While under the spell of the spores, they have in reality wandered into the heart of the Fung... (truncated)",

They had no plans to unite their people \u2013 Survival was their only viable dream. Things began to change once they realized that an unsteady order had fallen back into place in the lands. Roads of communication opened between settlements and people began to travel once more. With the gnomes and halflings traveling from the south, the humans found themselves once more gaining a foothold in the world, after being hunted like game by the drow and other savage clans. Though they were not yet a nation. Still a divided people struggling and surviving in small groups, unable to trust any but those immediately around them.\n\nHowever, now a new development has caused the people to rally and finally unify their forces. Years ago, rumours came from the grey fields that the divided clans of the savage races had begun to form truces, one small group at a time. These gangs were managable since most of these races themselves had suffered great loses during the War of Many. None of them were at their same power as they were centuries ago. Thus far, the outlying villages had managed to fend off any attackers and even carved out territorial boarders running along the deserts and towards the grey fields.\n\nOnly months ago, a new and much greater danger arose. This evil showed its numbers when they began to raid camps in the south edge, quickly ravaging the people as they marched their army north towards the edge of the Vale. Rumors began to spread of a shadow stretching for as far as the eye could see, dotted with the eyes of demons. Notice went out throughout the lands that it was time for man to rise up once more and defend this world. Now it is the responsability of these fighters, warriors, and brave commonfolk to search out and chase down the evils destroying their hopes of eventually taking back their home from the savages and of building a great nation once again.\n\nChapter Two\n\nSent into the mountains by a military desperate for any hope of survival, a group of soldiers, an Oracle, and a random adventurer picked up along the way trekked across fields, wastelands, hills and mountains. They fought ogres, lions and a basilisk. They were forced to infiltrate the enemy army in order to rescue a kidnapped ally. Many of them beheld the soft glow of the afterlife, just before being dragged back to the material world. Others instead embrassed the warmth of the basking light. Along the way, they managed to find a couple other adventurers in need of partnership to assure their survival in this world.\n\nNow, on the other side of the Breach Mountains, a group of once strangers, who possibly never would have even chosen a seat next to the other in a bar, find themselves staring into an unknown forest and vast wilderness. Their previous goal \u2013 to stay alive \u2013 has been accomplished, but they now become aware that they are alone, with no allies and a possibly vast number of enemies, with no clear designation.\n\nChapter Three\n\nSoon after the main force of the Skaldernian army made its way into the vastness of the desert in pursuit of the Dark Army, the outlying villages and farms began to rebuild their settlements as people returned to their homes. However, they had little time to settle back in as a new, much more menacing threat swept across the fields. Like locusts, swashes of undead hordes came in waves, destroying the body of every man, woman and child that came within their reach. Hearing of this plague making its way across the country, the citizens of Skalderna began leaving their homes, en masse traveling to the relative safety behind the walls of Langen. So while the people\u2019s spirit rebounded against the power of the Master, they now had no choice but to cower and hope that something will save them from the current scourge.\n\nConvinced that this new threat was brought on by the powers of a powerful mage, or perhaps several working in league with this \u201cDark Master\u201d, the collective council (made up of the leaders of the largest cities within Skalderna) decided that once and for all magic must not just be shunned upon, but outlawed entirely. No longer would it simply carry a stigma and those cursed with its touch be outcasted; now they would be hunted and sentence brought against them for the crimes they had obviously committed, or to keep them from the horrors that they would eventually commit after being corrupted by their power. The council sanctioned witch hunters to seek out those who would practice the arcane, while the churches also provided their own inquisitors whom they had trained for similar situations.\n\nMeanwhile, the people of the Shoanti tribes within the ever-burning desert were in a similar situation. They found themselves in an unfortunate battle with the people whom they would hope to someday call ally. However, while the warriors are well equipped for battle and the shaman well versed in the rites of the dead, neither are prepared to battle with the dead. What was once the Skaldernian army tasked with hunting down the Dark Army had now transformed into a group marching on the people of the desert; their bodies now simply an empty husk. With this undead army encroaching on their territories, they have had no choice but to leave their home and find haven in the mountains.
