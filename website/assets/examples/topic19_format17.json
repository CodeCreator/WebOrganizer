I found these by digging in the literature and hope these pointers are useful.\n\nThe answer to your question is no.\n\n  1. The first example was given by R.H. Bing, The Cartesian Product of a Certain Nonmanifold and a Line is $E^4$, Ann. of Math.\u00a0(2) 70 (1959) 399\u2013412. MR107228.\n\n    Bing describes a topological space $B$ \u2014 in fact a quotient space of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, sometimes called the Dogbone space \u2014 which is not a manifold and has the property that $B \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is homeomorphic to\u00a0$\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\n  2. Modifying this construction and relying heavily on work of Andrews and Curtis, K.W. Kwun, Product of Euclidean Spaces Modulo an Arc, Ann. of Math.\u00a0(2) 79 (1964) 104\u2013108, MR159312, produced product decompositions of $\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong X \\times Y$ for $n \\geq 6$ where neither $X$ nor $Y$ is a manifold.\n\n  3. Here are two freely available papers by A.J.\u00a0Boals:\n\n  4. Quoting C.D.\u00a0Bass, Some products of topological spaces wich are manifolds, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.\u00a081 (1981), 641\u2013646, MR601746, Corollary\u00a03 on page\u00a0645 \u201cgives abundant examples of factorizations of certain manifolds into nonmanifold factors.\u201d\n\n  5. A textbook covering these and many more topics:\n\n    Daverman, Robert J., Decompositions of manifolds, Pure and Applied Mathematics, 124, Academic Press, 1986, MR872468.

Nice detective work...I thought about searching through all of Bing's paper's.

How many natural frequency a object can have?\n\n\n\n\n1. the difference can be understood from the definitions itself:\n\n- proportional limit is strain below which the stress is proportional to strain i.e. linear relation between the two. e.g. \u00a0sigma=E*epsilon for steel.\n\n- elastic limit is strain below which the material can regain its original shape if the forces are release, doesn't matter if the stress-strain relation is linear or not. for example rubber. the strain-strain law is highly non-linear (and hence not \"proportional\") but still elastic.\n\n\n2. number of natural frequencies (or natural\u00a0modes of vibration) depend on number of degrees of freedom (DOF). i.e. number of possible different (unique) ways a body can be deformed. in reality, every body has infinite number of particles (nothing is absolutely rigid) and therefore infinite number of DOFs => infinite number of natual frequencies. practically, only frequencies that are in the range of interest (that affect behavior in operating range of freq) are important. these can be obtained from analytical or computational models. for example, in FEM, the no of natural freq is total number\u00a0of\u00a0DOF of the model.\u00a0 the more DOF u include (finer mesh), \u00a0the closer it gets to reality.\n\nmaterails exhibiting behaviour 1 (jj post above) are termed as \"hypoelastic\"\n\nSubscribe to Comments for \"difference between elastic limit and proportional limit\"\n\nRecent comments\n\nMore comments\n\n\nSubscribe to Syndicate",
