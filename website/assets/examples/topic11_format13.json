        "text":"Late Registration Extended\n\nPools will be available on the UFGT website on MONDAY. The new schedule has a reduced number of pools on Friday, but as stated, we cannot give people requested placement in pools.\n\nAlso, some great news! I\u2019m very ahead of schedule (thanks to Sawa) so\u00a0I will be extending pre-registration online until midnight on Sunday May 22nd!\u00a0Keep those last minute registrations coming. Also, hours for emergency registration have been extended for anyone who needs to get things done at the door. Sadly, four or five of you paid a venue fee but did not register for any games. You will need to come during Emergency Reg hours to add games and pay for them. Also Sadly, three or four people paid for game entry, but selected and paid either no venue fee or the casual-only\/non-tournament fee. You will not be entered into any tournament games until you pay a full venue fee.\n\n\nAbout Keits\n\nUFGT Director\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.

Play NGU Idle and get the exciting rush of so many numbers going up!\n\nWith NGU Idle you\u2019ll get:\n\n* Weekly updates! Maybe even more! Probably less!\n* An RPG and inventory system!\n* Loot drops for days!\n* A really weird story if you\u2019re into that.\n* A mix of Idle and Active play to satisfy everyone except really grumpy people.\n* Progress Bars everywhere!\n* A snarky, very active dev who is extremely attractive and not biased at all.\n* Crappy Puns.\n\nYou can also find NGU's discord here:\n\n\nYou click a bunch of buttons and make the numbers go up. C'mon, it's an idle game, not rocket science!\n\nJuly 25, 2019\n\nHey guys, I have some sad news: I won't be updating NGU on Armor Games any more. The game's still gonna be here, don't worry! It just won't receive any new updates. Kongregate and Kartridge versions are still being updated, and saves should be able to migrate there without any issue. plz forgive me, 4G <3\n\nMay 31, 2019\n\nBuild .423 \"More Art, Kong Badges, and Improved Kartridge Saving!\" * Added Boss Art for Bosses 101-150! We're all caught up now! Thanks again to the wonderful Musluk for the weird and hilarious pics! * Two Badges have been added to the Kongregate and Kartridge versions! This should mainly appeal to new players or the super noobies, they're fairly easy badges after all. Enjoy! * Tweaked the automated backup save system for Kartridge. Instead of NGUBackup.txt being overwritten every 30 minutes, two files are now written instead, NGUBackup.txt and NGUBackup2.txt. TLDR: if you lose your autosave, you have two backups to try to load! If one fails, the other ought to work! * If you load a file from a future build of NGU into an older version of the game, you are now directed to check for updates instead of a stupid \" File not found!\" message. * Kartridge saves now use the 24-hour system in their file names. RIP Americans. * Tweaked the rarity of a secret special item because apparently it is THE LITERAL END OF THE WORLD for it to be as rare as it is, for some people. Yeah, i'm putting you guys on blast in the patch notes. Deal with it!\n\nMay 19, 2019\n\nBuild .422 \" New Zones, New Titan, Free Spins and Lots of Fancy Art!\" * Added 3 new zones and a new titan, extending the progression a good deal! * Added items 301-342. * You'll notice some items have a \"Wish Speed\" bonus. This currently does nothing but will have a major impact in a future patch! * Fixed a bug where Titan 8 dropped more often than the displayed odds. Big oops. * Fixed a bug where Titan 7 didn't drop loot sometimes. Also oops! * Fixed a bug with Titan 8's AI that made it more annoying to fight than it should have. Also slightly nerfed the explosion attack. * Added 19 new quirks that improve a lot of different stats! * Added BOSS PORTRAITS for Bosses 1-100 to the Fight Boss menu! The art was provided courtesy of the very handsome and talented Musluk. Blow plenty of kisses their way! * Gaudy, Mega Lands, and Beardverse gear has been slightly buffed. Again! * For those on Kartridge: The game now automatically creates a backup save in the same folder as the autosave, named NGUBackup.txt! If you ever have an issue with your autosave be sure to load this to recover your progress! * Sales have been swapped out! * Permanently reduced the price of beast butter by 50%. I can't offer refunds for stuff already bought, please understand and don't cram my inbox fuller than a can of sardines :C. * Added a SPECIAL PROMO if you check out the game on Kartridge! Head to the Info n Stuff menu and you'll be able to claim 7 free daily spins! You might also try playing the game on Kartridge but I'm a patch note, not a cop.\nCommenting Rules & Guidelines\n\nWe may use cookies to help customize your experience, including performing analytics and serving ads.\nLearn More",

This is a big boost to development of Resistance Force. BirthNight is audio\/music guy primarily but fell love into mapping, modelling and many other things. This allows me to focus more on the game core and together making assets faster and better.\n\nBuild #16 2012\/11\/13 (public alpha):\n- Added 3 new maps\n- Fixed reloading animation\n- Added dynamic weapon movement when moving mouse\n- Improved leaning\n- Added correct penumbra for dynamic shadows\n- Removed tips\n- Added server browser\n- Added ability to call vote (for map change)\n- Fixed head triangles that were popping into view sometimes\n- Fixed visible floating weapon at origin when player connects\n- Added 64bit binaries for Linux (also fixes problem with ATI drivers)\n\n\n1. blender (2012\/12\/03 09:33)\nI was a bit afraid that the project had gone to halt, so I'm very pleased to see this update. I'll try the Linux version in a few weeks, when I get the chance.\n\nIt's nice to see that you have basically the whole game running there. It looks graphically ok, but a bit dull. That's reasonable, as I realize that there's so much stuff to implement for this kind of a game. I would think that some sort of multitexturing could help to create variety.\n\nAdd comment\n\nConfirmation code:\n\u00a0 (type the letters shown in the picture)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2007-2012 ADVEL s.r.o. | Privacy Policy",
