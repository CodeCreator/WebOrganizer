That little boy could be so naughty at times, especially when he pulled your or Bella's tail and then run off.\n\nRemember when you were a pup, you jumped over the table beside my armchair, scattering everything on it and landing on my lap? I wondered what was happening, and there was you with such a pleased look on your face.\n\nI miss seeing you on my bed when I try and get in it and telling you to move over. Often you'd pretend to be asleep.\n\nMum got another car yesterday, I wish you were here to see it my boy, I'm sure you would want to ride in it. Its a Land Rover Discovery, not new but nice, it's that beautiful dark Land Rover green. I'm pretty sure you'd like it my boy.\n\nThe house feels so empty, even with Bella, Hobo and Spud. I miss you laying in front of my feet, and at times resting your beautiful proud head on them.\n\nIt's time to go play Merlin with all your puppy pals, enjoy my wonderful big boy.\n\nRemember, I love you Merlin\n\n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nEnter your comment information or log in if you have an account.\n\nFields marked with * are required\n\nAnti-spam Challenge:\n7 + 4 =\n\n\nMerlin (In loving memory)\n\n\nFamily Pets\n\nLady (In\nloving memory)\nMonty (In\nloving memory)\nBella (In\nLoving Memory)\n\n\n(What does RSS do?)",

They return, escorting Smudge, one on each side.\n\nDad: Smudge, Present yourself to your family and kin!\n\nBella and Chloe lead Smudge until he stands before Dad, and then they solemnly move two paces away.\n\nDad: Smudge, Do you know why your family and kin have brought you here tonight?\n\nSmudge: No.\n\nDad: They are here to bear witness and affirm what I as head of this household am about to bestow apon you.\n\nBaci, Dolce, Magoo, Bella and Chloe look at each other and then at Smudge.\n\nDad: Tonight, You stood at the backdoor and growled for no apparent reason.\n\nSmudge: I might have.\n\nDad: Good. So you admit the action which is the cause of all this ceremony tonight. Do you know what was discovered apon hearing your growl at the backdoor?\n\nSmudge: I think so, I was growling at it.\n\nDad: But was it in your yard?\n\nSmudge: No. It was past the fence over near the...\n\nDad: It was over near the road. Not a real busy road but a dangerous road nonetheless.\n\nSmudge: Yes, You always told us to stay away from the road because it was dangerous.\n\nDad: Do you know what I saw when I went to investigate what you were growling at?\n\nSmudge: The furry cat that sometimes comes to visit us.\n\nDad: Yes. The furry cat that comes to visit our yard from time to time. You have done a great and noble thing dear furriend.\n:: Dad speaks to the other Cats ::\nWhen I looked to see what was bothering dear Smudge, I saw our dear furry visitor attempting to cross the road at the end of our block. Now our road is not extremely busy but other stupid humans drive too fast and without care and attention to felines and puppies who might be out for an unsupervised stroll. I saw this poor feline soul starting to cross the road. I yelled at the feline. The cat surprisingly turned back and did not cross the road. Now if its home had laid across the road's expanse it would have ran faster across the road. But it did not. It came back to our side of the road. The side of the road where its home must surely be. By your actions, Smudge, I was able to prevent an unknown furriend from doing something that might endanger it own life. To do something for someone or some furriend that you do not even know that is the greatest act of honour and compassion known on this Earth.\n\nAs the bean of this household, it is my honour to bestow upon you the rank and privileges of the Holy and Ancient Order of the Catnip. Rise now, Sir Smudge, and accept your honours.\n\n\n\n  2. Oh dear Smudge, we are so proud of you! Oops, we meant to say Sir Smudge!\n\n    Purrrrrrrs, China Cat & Willow\n\n  3. Go, Sir Smudge!\n\n    I hope everycat is getting on better in the house whapping or hissing!\n\n  4. Way to go Smudge! We all need to look out for each other, and you are setting a great example.\n\n    Good luck to your Dad in his job hunt.\n\n  5. Yay Smudge! You did a good thing!",

Earlier I got lots of cherries, then a big crop of plums. Now it's time for pears and apples. First I'm going to tackle the pears. Lots of great pears are way up high -- of course!\nThese pears will make tasty eating!\nThe ladder couldn't get up under these branches, so I had to climb up to get to the apples. I'll be making a lot of applesauce this year.\nI think I've done enough fruit picking for now. It's time to supervise my minions. \"Get to work, minions!\"\nThe minions seem to be working well, so I can sneak in a little siesta.\n\nI have a lot of property to take care of. Some of it is set up for pasture, and some isn't. I'm taking a few minutes to look over a choice location for a new pasture (and prime grazing).\n[Molly's view]\n\nNow, I need to get the tractor out to mow this area down so I can get it ready to be a good pasture next year. I'll head to the barn to get out that old tractor...\n\nUh-oh. There seems to be a bit of a problem here!\nI think I've got it...\n\nOff we go!\n\nOne of the best times on the farm is relaxing on the porch after a hard day's work. Cool breezes, a great view, cold water from the well... ahh... a cow's life!",

And how much does the vet charge?\" she inquired thoughtfully.\n\n\"I think it's forty dollars.\"\n\n\"How nice of them to do that.\"\n\n\"I think they realize some people don't want to catch the cats to have them euthanized, so this at least keeps them from breeding.\"\n\n\"Yeah. \"\n\nHannah was having a little trouble with the whole deal herself. A conservationist and noter of all things native disappearing, she'd never been one to tolerate outdoor cats. It would not go away if they ignored it; rather, it would multiply. With a little help from strangers via the internet, Hannah was trying to prepare for action. Although she recognized her chosen\n\ncourse as the best available, she still stumbled over its lack of a happy ending. At best, the silver kitty would continue to live under the porch, frightened and uncomfortable, spooking the wildlife that visited Laura's bird feeders. The cat was so wild it could barely stand to be seen. Even if the animal shelters weren't already filled to bursting with pets surrendered under the economic collapse, this kitty would never have a home.\n\nIn the back of her mind while she was bicycling to and from work, while she cranked the computer and returned phone calls, Hannah was troubled by an overweight bride- to- be who now had her name and e-mail address-- sometimes seeming an opportunist just like the silver kitty, and being geared for survival in a life cycle that no longer made sense.\n\nwhich means they'll fix it for a reduced price, but then you put it back where you found it. They check it to make sure it's disease- free first. And they cut off the tip of one ear to mark it as having been fixed. But I have to trap it.\n\nIssue #1",
