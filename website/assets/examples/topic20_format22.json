        "text":"Is your Windows computer slow? It\u2019s probably deteriorating\n\nIs your Windows computer slow? It\u2019s probably deteriorating\n\nAren\u2019t computers fascinating? With one device, you can do so many amazing things \u2026\n\nYou probably recognize the feeling of coming home from the store and finally manage to unpack your new computer. For the first few months, everything works very fast, but after a period of time, you can feel it getting more and more complicated. The fact that your computer can start to deteriorate is due to many reasons. In this guide, you will find a series of suggested solutions for Windows computers.\n\n1. Your computer uses too many resources!\n\nSymptoms:\u00a0Your computer is slower when you have a few browser tabs open\n\nIt takes an infinitely long time to open programs\n\nSolution A: Try restarting your computer\n\nOne trick that works for almost all technical problems is to reboot the device. By restarting it we do not mean to put it in power saving mode, but to do a real restart.\n\nWhat happens is that all processes are shut down and reset, freeing up resources for the computer such as the hard drive and RAM.\n\nTo do this, restart your computer using the built-in function found by clicking the Windows icon at the bottom left of the screen. Then, select the on \/ off symbol and click restart. Alternatively, you can turn it off and restart it manually with the physical button.\n\nSolution B: Close unnecessary programs running in the background\n\nThe fastest way to do this is by opening the Task Manager. There are many ways to open this list of the \u201cmost common\u201d ways;\n\nRight-click on the taskbar (the bar at the bottom of the screen) and click on the task manager\n\nPress CTRL, ALT and DEL to access the security overview. Even there, you can click on the activity manager.\n\nIn our opinion, the fastest way is to press CTRL, Shift and ESC.\n\nMost likely, you will only be able to watch certain shows. To get a complete overview of the programs that are running, click on \u201cMore information\u201d at the bottom of the window.\n\nNow you can see all the running programs that can terminate redundant activities.\n\n2. You have too many programs in the startup list.\n\nSymptoms:\u00a0Turning on the computer takes too long\n\nMany programs start when you turn on the computer\n\nSolution: Settings in \u201cStart\u201d\n\nIn the activities manager, you will find a button relatively high up where it says \u201cStart\u201d.\n\nDuring the automatic startup, you will find all the programs that the computer opens automatically when you turn on the computer. You can go through the list and turn off unnecessary programs that you think should not start automatically, by right-clicking on the program and then selecting \u201cdisable\u201d. When you do this, your computer will generally start up a bit faster, and there will be fewer programs running in the background.\n\n3. Your hard drive is full.\n\nSymptoms:\u00a0You can no longer save files\n\nThe computer gets complicated in general\n\nYou cannot run certain programs\n\nSolution A: Clean the hard drive\n\nWhen the computer runs programs, temporary files are created and stored on the hard drive. Removing them can improve your computer\u2019s performance. The first step is to press \u201cWindows key + R\u201d. A window should appear asking you to type a command.\n\nType \u201ccleanmgr\u201d and then press OK or Enter. Next, select your device, usually Windows (C :). There you can choose the files you want to delete. You can select temporary Internet files, Downloads (in the Downloads folder) and Trash if you don\u2019t have to save any files in the Trash or Downloads folder (Save the files you want to prevent from being downloaded to another location).\n\nThen, confirm your selection with \u201cErase system files\u201d, and you can exit the program when this is ready.\n\nSolution B: Uninstall programs\n\nYou will find all your installed programs in the control panel. Press the window button and type \u201ccontrol panel.\u201d Open the panel and look for \u201cPrograms and Features.\u201d Then, select the program you want to remove and click \u201cuninstall\u201d just above the list.\n\n4. Your computer has a virus!\n\nSymptoms:\u00a0Pop-ups, slow computer, strange internet pages that open automatically, etc.\n\nSolution: Virus Protection\n\nUse Windows\u2019 own virus protection, and you will find it when you search for \u201cWindows Security\u201d or any other antivirus program. We suggest Avast or AVG as free alternatives. Search and remove any threats.\n\nMalware can only extract a lot of resources, and it can be good to check your computer from time to time.\n\n5. You have old or \u201cweak\u201d components.\n\nSymptoms:\u00a0Your computer is unable to access many browser tabs\n\n(You want to save multiple files)\n\nSolution: Update some components\n\nIt may also be that your computer cannot function at the levels that you require. There is always the option to update certain components. This is, in most cases, cheaper compared to buying a new computer and a bit more environmentally friendly. It would be best if you kept in mind that it is usually a bit more difficult to update a laptop than a desktop one.\n\nHard drive:\u00a0If you have low memory, you can buy hard drives. Today there are both; optical (HDD) which is a bit slower and digital (SSD) with generally higher speed.\n\nRAM:\u00a0Or also known as Random Access Memory is the working memory of your computer. There, the program files are temporarily saved so they \u201cfloat\u201d, and you don\u2019t have to wait forever when you want to do something. The more RAM you have, the better. Feel free to check what type of RAM you need for your particular computer. The most current for desktop computers is DDR4 DIMMs and for notebooks SO-DIMM DDR4. The oldest generation is called DDR3. It would be best if you kept in mind that you must have the correct socket on the motherboard for each RAM.\n\n\nTo sum up:\n\n\u2013 Do a proper reboot\n\n\u2013 Turn off programs running in the background\n\n\u2013 Adjust Windows startup list\n\n\u2013 Delete temporary files\n\n\u2013 Remove redundant programs\n\n\u2013 Update components\n\nWe hope that with this guide, you have managed to speed up your computer or at least you have learned something about temporary files and RAM.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"About Budak Ransomware virus\n\nThe ransomware known as Budak Ransomware is classified as a very damaging infection, due to the amount of damage it could cause. It is likely you\u2019ve never come across ransomware before, in which case, you may be particularly shocked. Ransomware can use powerful encryption algorithms for the encryption process, which prevents you from accessing them any longer. The reason this malware is thought to be a serious threat is because it is not always possible to decrypt files. You do have the choice of paying the ransom but that is not the wisest idea. Budak Ransomware\n\nThere are numerous cases where files were not decrypted even after victims comply with the demands. Think about what\u2019s preventing cyber criminals from just taking your money. You ought to also keep in mind that the money will be used for malicious software projects in the future. Data encoding malware is already costing a fortune to businesses, do you really want to be supporting that. And the more people comply with the demands, the more profitable ransomware gets, and that attracts many people to the industry. Consider investing that money into backup instead because you might end up in a situation where data loss is a possibility again. And you could just remove Budak Ransomware without worry. You may find details on how to safeguard your device from this threat in the below paragraph, if you\u2019re not sure about how the ransomware even got into your computer.\n\nHow did you acquire the ransomware\n\nA file encoding malicious program generally travels through methods like email attachments, malicious downloads and exploit kits. Seeing as these methods are still quite popular, that means that users are pretty negligent when they use email and download files. More sophisticated methods might be used as well, although not as frequently. Criminals write a pretty credible email, while pretending to be from some legitimate company or organization, attach the infected file to the email and send it off. Those emails commonly mention money because that is a delicate topic and users are more likely to be impulsive when opening money related emails. It is quite frequent that you\u2019ll see big company names like Amazon used, for example, if Amazon sent an email with a receipt for a purchase that the user did not make, he\/she wouldn\u2019t wait to open the file attached. Be on the lookout for certain signs before opening files attached to emails. Before opening the file attached, look into the sender of the email. And if you do know them, double-check the email address to make sure it matches the person\u2019s\/company\u2019s legitimate address. Also, look for mistakes in grammar, which usually tend to be quite evident. You should also take note of how you are addressed, if it\u2019s a sender who knows your name, they\u2019ll always greet you by your name, instead of a universal Customer or Member. Some file encoding malware could also use unpatched software on your device to enter. All software have vulnerabilities but when they\u2019re discovered, they\u2019re normally fixed by software creators so that malware cannot take advantage of it to infect. Unfortunately, as as could be seen by the widespread of WannaCry ransomware, not all people install updates, for various reasons. We recommend that you install a patch whenever it becomes available. Updates could install automatically, if you find those notifications annoying.\n\nHow does it behave\n\nSoon after the ransomware infects your system, it\u2019ll look for certain file types and once they\u2019ve been found, it\u2019ll lock them. Even if what happened was not clear from the beginning, you will definitely know something is wrong when you cannot open your files. All encoded files will have a file extension attached to them, which aids people in identifying which ransomware specifically has infected their computer. Unfortunately, files might be permanently encoded if a strong encryption algorithm was used. A ransom notification will alert you that your files have been encoded and what you need to do next. The proposed a decryption tool will not be for free, of course. Ransom amounts are generally specified in the note, but in some cases, victims are requested to email them to set the price, it might range from some tens of dollars to possibly a couple of hundred. Evidently, paying the ransom isn\u2019t suggested. Only consider complying with the demands when you have attempted everything else. Maybe you simply don\u2019t recall making copies. Or, if you\u2019re lucky, a free decryption software may be available. A decryptors could be available for free, if the file encoding malware was decryptable. Before you decide to pay, look for a decryptor. It would be wiser to purchase backup with some of that money. And if backup is an option, you may recover files from there after you uninstall Budak Ransomware virus, if it still remains on your device. If you familiarize yourself with data encoding malware is distributed, you should be able to avoid future infections of this type. At the very least, don\u2019t open email attachments left and right, keep your programs updated, and only download from sources you know you can trust.\n\nBudak Ransomware removal\n\nIf the file encrypting malicious program still remains, an anti-malware software will be required to get rid of it. When trying to manually fix Budak Ransomware virus you might bring about additional harm if you aren\u2019t the most computer-savvy person. Using a malware removal tool would be much less bothersome. These kinds of programs are made with the intention of detecting or even blocking these types of infections. Look into which anti-malware program would best match what you require, download it, and allow it to scan your device for the infection once you install it. The software won\u2019t help recover your files, however. If you are sure your system is clean, restore files from backup, if you have it.\n\n\nMore information about WiperSoft and Uninstall Instructions. Please review WiperSoft EULA and Privacy Policy.

However, imagine needing to access your work emails or your social media accounts \u2013 and your laptop\u2019s at home and your phone just died.\n\nEmily Green\n\nEmily Green\n\nJan 22, 2017 \u00b7 3 min read\n\nHow to use a public computer safely\n\nA public computer would be a reasonable choice, but it\u2019s risky. Did you know that it could put your private information at risk? Using a public computer presents similar threats as using public Wi-Fi (find out how to stay safe on public Wi-Fi). That\u2019s why we put together a few tips that will help you protect your data and use a public computer safely.\n\n1: Delete downloaded files\n\nIf you need to download anything to a public computer (i.e. your flight tickets or your booking confirmations), always make sure to delete these files and empty the Recycle Bin. It\u2019s even better to use memory stick for your files. Instead of saving downloads on the computer, just save them on your USB.\n\n2: Delete your browser history\n\nHow to use a public computer safely? Right after you\u2019ve finished browsing, delete all of your history, cookies, and temporary Internet files. Usually, you can do this by clicking \u2018History\u2019 or \u2018Privacy\u2019 tabs on your browser. If you\u2019re using Chrome, click on the three-dash icon on the upper right-hand corner and select \u2018History\u2019. From here, it\u2019s easy to clear your browsing data. For Firefox, go to \u2018Settings\u2019, click on \u2018Privacy & Security\u2019, and then choose \u2018Clear private data\u2019.\n\n3: Don\u2019t save passwords\n\nIf you need to access a website that requires your login details and\/or your password, never click \u2018remember me\u2019 or \u2018save password\u2019. This might seem obvious, but most people are so used to clicking these buttons that they automatically do so on public computers. If you do accidentally end up saving your password, don\u2019t panic. You can delete this information too.\n\n4: Don\u2019t enter highly sensitive information\n\nA public computer is not the best place to check your bank account or shop online, nor should you use it with your work network. Not only could hackers compromise your credentials, they could also get into your work network and access your company\u2019s information. The same goes for sensitive personal data, like bank account logins or anything that requires your government ID information.\n\n5: Restart the computer\n\nOne way to make sure that your private information is safe is to restart your computer when you\u2019re done with it.

How about security cameras? Someone might be snooping over you in the physical world and collecting your data.\n\n9: Use your common sense\n\nLastly, you should always use your common sense. Keep an eye out for things that might feel odd. For example, if your connection speed suddenly drops, that might mean that someone is leaking your data. If in doubt, it\u2019s better to disconnect the internet, or at least to avoid visiting websites that ask for your personal information. Use a public computer safely and you won't get into any trouble.\n\nOnline security starts with a click.\n\nStay safe with the world\u2019s leading VPN",
