No, really! Where was I? I had been somewhat rudely awakened by a sound resembling a trombone pressed to the lips of a four-year-old. What was a young child doing playing trombone in my bedroom? And at this hour! This hour? I prised open a sleepy eye - with some difficulty - and looked at my watch, from which the only information I could glean was that I still possessed a watch. The child ceased its cacophony momentarily; long enough for me to recognise the feeling of relief I get when Rex stops snoring. I looked across the room, and sure enough there was Rex, dead-to-world. So, if Rex was here, all I needed to work out was where \"here\" was. Slowly the jigsaw puzzle that was my fragmented mind on the morning of Saturday the third of May, began to piece itself together and recall the previous evening.\n\nWe had decided to eat at the hotel; primarily due to its proximity to our bedroom but also because we felt it was the proper thing to do. Mr Zographakis had been very hospitable and we wanted to show him that we appreciated it. We had eaten well that afternoon down in the lower village, so this evening's meal was not to be a huge feast, though somehow it managed to become one. I had meant to ask for a miso kilo (half litre) of \"village wine\", but had omitted the \"miso\" (I don't usually do things in halves, so my vocabulary refused to access the Greek word for \"half\" or at least I failed to enunciate it properly!). The arrival of a somewhat larger jug than I had expected, altered my choice of what to eat from \"just a starter\" (which I had already ordered), to a starter and a main course (pasta I believe; or at least it's a fair bet to assume so), as I felt I didn't want to be drinking too much and not eating at the same time (see I have my sensible moments too!). A fine meal was had before Mr Zographakis treated us to an extra litre of village wine and then proceeded to disappear and share a family meal, leaving us sitting there waiting to pay the bill. I have no idea why I felt it necessary to pay the bill that evening - we were, after all, staying in the rooms above - perhaps I had high-hopes of being up-and-away before the family Zographakis arose; fat-chance of that happening...ever! So, we sat and sipped and sipped and sat; I suffered an uncontrollable giggling fit, as we entered our third hour in this state of \"waiting for the waiter\". By way of apology for their prolonged absence, one of the Zographakis' (there are quite a number of them), brought us some melon and the obligatory tsikoudhia! Uh-oh! It would have been rude to refuse the wine or the raki, wouldn't it?\u00a0Rude, but wise! Tsikoudhia and its effects, I have briefly documented in chapter one, and \"village wine\" is also matter of taste. My taste will become accustomed rather quickly to most things containing alcohol - as I am sure you have already learned - with the exception of gin! Retsina is a case in point. My father - a red-head Scot, who'd worked in various distilleries of the Scottish highlands in his youth - once told me how he had hated Retsina until he\u00a0discovered how cheap it was and determined thenceforth to enjoy at least that aspect of it. Needless to say he also started to enjoy the taste very shortly afterwards. That's one of the great aspects of travel for me; sampling local produce quite often alters ones taste.\n\nWith my legs now out of bed I studied my feet and realised that they were demanding to be scratched. \"Itchy feet\". Not only is this a fine metaphor for the way I felt, but it is also a condition I suffer from when I am anxious - and I was anxious - though this itchiness may have been caused by one or more of the mosquitoes that had serenaded me that night! I headed to the bathroom and with rheumy eyes looked at the pasty-faced figure that had etched itself onto the mirror, mimicking my every move. I felt nauseous, both with anxiety and another feeling that I knew only too well; a hangover for which the \"guilty\" party had been the wine (not me for drinking copious amounts of it, note!) For the foreseeable future (two days as it turned out!), \"village wine\" would join gin on my list of \"leave well alone\".\n\nI had promised myself that the latest I would rise would be 7.30AM, so what the hell was the time? I tried to see if I could obtain any more information from my watch than I had a few moments ago; I couldn't. As my vision slowly improved however, I noticed a wall clock which suggested that it might be 8.43AM.\u00a0I stood up and decided to have a closer look at this clock, stumbling across the room as I did so, and stubbing my toe on one of the legs of the bed, what was far more painful though was that 8.43 had now become 8.44. Alarm! How could I have been so stupid? This was the day I had been planning for the past two years and now it had arrived I was nervous...no, terrified and to add injury to insult, stupefied from the excesses of the previous night\u00a0too!\n\nI have strange hangovers; not just headaches and bleariness for me, oh no...it's far worse than that. I suffer from panic attacks. These can be of such intensity that anybody with any sense would immediately take the vow and never let a drop pass their lips again; so no abstinence for me! My introspective anger didn't help either; it never does, but I deserved this fury from the better-part of my remaining\u00a0brain-cells. Over the past couple of years I had blagged and bragged; told everybody I knew - and others I didn't - at great length of my great plans to walk the \"great island\". In the warm light of this morning, what I feared most was that I had been lying to myself for all that time. Was I really capable! I certainly didn't look up for anything other than lying down. \"Ah come on man, easy-peasy this'll be\", a small voice told me; I hardly recognised that voice as mine and I am still not quite sure it was! Very shortly I would find out whether I could walk in a straight line - if at all - with a 15 Kg rucksack on my shoulders, though at least I had chosen a relatively easy first route. The direction would be pretty straightforward - Velonado to Rodakino, via Alones was mostly a southerly course with a soupcon of South-West thrown in for good measure - and I reckoned on six hours at the outside and a good chance for a swim at the end of it all. \"That's the stuff, feel better already\", I lied, as I stared at this shadow of my former-self and it stared back at me with red eyes, yellow skin, British teeth and no discernible upper-lip. Yep, my reflection looked better than I felt.\n\nHow he does it is beyond me, but the boy Rex had woken, dressed and was sitting on the balcony by the time I had showered and\u00a0brushed my teeth, when only a few minutes before, hadn't he been fast asleep? We headed downstairs to where Mr Zographakis and a hearty breakfast of misithra - a goats' cheese that packs as\u00a0powerful a punch as his village wine - and bread, greeted us. Mr Z is a man with many strings to his bow and a nephew who runs a hotel in Koraka - the beach resort a kilometre or so South of Kato Rodakino. Excellent, a place to stay. So with this information in our armoury, and bidding our host farewell - promising him that we would return in a month - off we set for Velonado. It was now past 9.30 and as much as I was looking forward to coming back to Argyroupolis, I hadn't meant as soon as we actually did! Ten minutes after setting-off we were back, Rex deciding that the needle of the petrol gauge pointing vaguely in the direction of \"empty\" was a bad portent. A look at the map, showed the nearest petrol station just East of where we had started, and like the prodigal son there I was, back, and grinning like an idiot, at the man whom I had just told I would \"see next month\". He confirmed that the petrol station was indeed a kilometre or so East of here and thanking him, we drove-off to find it. I liked Mr Zographakis, but knew that we would be seeing\u00a0him again once the car's thirst had been sated, as this road\u00a0 - with the hotel that he was sitting outside - was by far the most direct route to Velonado. I would have preferred to have driven back around Psiloritis rather than have to face the embarrassment of having to say \"farewell\" thrice, to anybody...even Mr Z, but Rex wasn't with me on this one, and neither was the clock. And so it was that we tooted our horn at our friend for the third and last time.\n\nBeware, I shall be proffering - in graphic detail - the short-comings of the way-marking of the E4 throughout the forthcoming chapters, but for now, let's just say that Rex and I (his navigator!) had tremendous problems re-finding Velonado - a place we had visited from the very point we were driving from, not 24 hours earlier. Two wrong turns and a possible correct one, had there been a road to drive on indicated with horrible prescience, the problems I was to encounter later that day, but we did eventually make Velonado at around 10.30 in the morning and sat down for the second time in less than a day, at the \"kafeneion\".\n\nThe word \"kafeneion\" conjures up images of old men, sitting around playing their umpteenth game of tavli (backgammon), of the morning, whilst eking-out their \"Elliniko cafe\" (Greek coffee) - wherever you go in the Eastern Mediterranean, these small \"silt-lined\" coffee cups go by the name of the country they are being drunk in. Of course it was originally \"Arabic coffee\", but try telling that to a Greek, a Turk or a Cypriot. In these places a single ... (truncated)",

        "text":"Story of Tam and Cam\n\nEvery country has its stories and if you are on aVietnam travel, there is one that resembles that of Cinderella, at least the first part and the happy ending. Vietnam travel packages reveal a very interesting country and plenty of legends to enjoy. Talk to a Vietnam travel agent and you will certainly find out more if you wish.\n\nstory of tam and cam\n\nMany years ago, a widower lived with his daughter, Tam, when he met and married again. He was not to know that the woman he married was truly wicked. They had a daughter together whom they named Cam. The wife adored Cam but treated Tam badly, not being one of her own. Tam\u2019s poor treatment began immediately her father remarried; she was not allowed to join a celebration banquet and was sent to bed early, and hungry. That was before Cam was born and then things got even worse. Tam\u2019s father believed the lies his wife told him about Tam who was banished to the kitchen and told to look after herself.\n\nShe was forced to work very hard getting many menial tasks around the house. Her hands became blistered and her hair dirty and matted. One day, she looked at her image and saw how she looked. Washing her face, she looked very pretty and her step-mother realised it too, wishing even more that an accident might befall her.\n\nTam was sent out fishing with her step-sister who spent the day playing while Tam worked hard, catching a basketful of fish. Cam\u2019s basket was empty but she stole Tam\u2019s fish as she bathed in the water. Tam knew she would be beaten when she returned with an empty basket. However, the Goddess of Mercy appeared in front of her and noticed she was crying. After hearing her story, the Goddess suggested she look again in her basket where she saw a red finned fish with golden eyes. The Goddess said Tam should put the fish in the well and feed it three times a day which she duly did.\n\nHer step-mother noticed strange behaviour in Tam but the fish never appeared when anyone else was there. However, the step-mother disguised herself in Tam\u2019s clothes, caught the fish, killed it and ate it. The Goddess reappeared and told Tam to find the bones, bury them then a wish would be granted. She couldn\u2019t find the bones by a chicken said she would show Tam where they were in exchange for some rice. She took the bones and buried them as instructed. Soon, she was to get jewellery, gold and dresses and was indeed a very happy girl.\n\nWhen the Autumn Festival came around, she was told to stay at home and finish her work while Cam and her mother went out in their best clothes. She prayed to the Goddess for help and she made sure that her work was finished quickly so she could go to the Festival. She dressed up and went. When Cam saw her, she said to her mother that the rich lady looked like Tam; indeed, it was. Tam ran, scared she had been recognised but in her haste left a silver slipper. Soldiers picked it up and gave it to the King. The King asked every lady to try it on but it was so small, no one could get it on. The King announced that when he found the person whose slipper it was, he would make her his wife.\n\nTam was the last woman to try it on; it fitted and she became Queen. Cam and her step-mother were very unhappy but could do nothing about it. Tam returned home on an anniversary and following custom had to climb a tree to get nuts when requested to by her step-mother. The tree began to sway violently when she was up there because her step-mother was trying to cut it down. It crashed to the ground and Tam was killed. As she had hoped, Cam then became Queen while Tam\u2019s spirit lived as a nightingale in the royal garden. The King was moved to tears by the nightingale\u2019s singing and he invited it on to his sleeve. The King got a golden cage which he put in his bedroom with the bird inside. Cam became jealous of the bird who received so much attention. She killed and cooked it, throwing the feathers into the garden. Cam told the King that the nightingale had probably become bored and flown away.\n\nTam\u2019s spirit however returned as a magnificent tree which bore a single golden fruit with a lovely smell. An old woman passed by and said she would keep the fruit for its smell and never eat it; the fruit dropped down into the old woman\u2019s bag. The next day, the old woman returned home to find a tidy house and a meal on the table; magic. The next day, the old woman hid and saw a young lady come out of the fruit to start work. The old lady rushed to tear up the peel of the fruit so that the young lady couldn\u2019t go back.\u00a0 She stayed in the forest and regarded the old lady as her mother.\n\nThe King got lost in the forest one day and came across the old woman\u2019s cottage as darkness drew in. He was offered shelter and food. He recognised it as food that Tam used to make him when she was Queen. When Tam was called the King recognised her immediately. She was restored to her position while Cam was largely ignored. When Cam sought advice about how to become whiter and more beautiful to attract the King\u2019s attention again, Tam said the answer was to immerse herself in boiling water which she did, and died as a result. Cam\u2019s mother wept until she was blind and died of a broken heart. Tam lived happily ever after.\n\nTalking of happy; you will fly home after travel in Vietnam with a smile on your face and plenty of happy memories.",

        "text":"Readers' Submissions\n\nFaces of Palau \u2013 Meet Mysty and Madonna\n\n  \u2022 Written by\u00a0Akulka\n  \u2022 August 13th, 2011\n  \u2022 6 min read\n\nMeet Mysty the Student:\n\nTravelling from Peleliu back to Palau\u2019s main island and its capital Koror I take the official state boat rather than the speed boat that had transferred me over a couple of days earlier. Even though it takes three times as long I enjoy the journey far more as one has a so much better chance to enjoy the stunning scenery along the way.\n\nSitting on the upper deck of the boat I share a bench with two young local girls. The chattier one of them keeps smiling at me curiously while her friend appears to be rather shy.\n\nSo what\u2019s your name?\u201d I ask her.\n\nI\u2019m Mysty, and her name is Madonna!\u201d she says, pointing a finger at her shy friend.\n\nMadonna like the mother of Jesus or like the pop star?\u201d I tease.\n\nMadonna first rolls and then averts her eyes.\n\nSo what are you going to Koror for?\u201d I address Mysty.\n\n\nAt first sight I believed Madonna and her friend are in their mid-teens, but as they already go to college I figure they must be at least 18 years or older already. Pretty Mysty is dressed in tight jeans and a t-shirt. Madonna wears a long skirt, a plain-colored blouse, and a flower behind her left ear. Both wear their black hair combed back, revealing attractive features.\n\nOver there, the big guy, that\u2019s our friend Fluffy Larry!\u201d\n\nFluffy Larry waves at me. His name is fitting. He\u2019s a big and chubby Palauan guy with curly black hair. He wears a loose black T-shirt with print that reads \u201cHot as Hades, Fort Hood 5k Run\u201d on the front. On the back there\u2019s a large print of an American Abrams tank and more letters that spell out: \u201cA moment in III Corps history, 2 Aug 90, Saudi Arabia, Desert Storm, Desert Shield\u201d.\n\n\n\nMysty and Madonna have boarded the ship with a bunch of provisions. There is a plastic box filled with some sort of fried rice and shredded spam, and a few plastic bags full of fruits. Soon after the boat had left the dock the girls started spooning rice into their mouths from the plastic boxes, and later opening the plastic bags and cutting fruits into little mouth-fitting bits and pieces. Some bits they throw over the railing and into the sea.\n\nFeeding the fish?\u201d I ask.\n\nMysty laughs. Madonna rolls her eyes again.\n\n\u201cThat piece no good!\u201d Mysty says and points at the spot where the piece of fruit hit the water and sunk. \u201cYou want Palauan apple?\u201d She hands me a small slice of the familiar looking fruit.\n\n\u201cIn Thailand they call this Chompoo!\u201d I tell her. \u201cThere people like to dip this fruit into a mix of sugar and chili before eating. It\u2019s quite good, perhaps you should try!\u201d\n\nMysty looks mystified. \u201cWith chili?\u201d she repeats after me incredulously. \u201cWe have this!\u201d\n\nShe shows me a plastic cup full of reddish paste that I hadn\u2019t noticed before. \u201cShould I put it on for you?\u201d\n\n\nI put the piece of fruit into my mouth. The flavor is a concoction of salty, sweet, strangely synthetic, and goes down with a fizzy aftertaste. It tastes weird in a funny yet not unpleasant way.\n\nWhat\u2019s in this?\u201d\n\nOh\u2026many things!\u201d\n\nDrawing out some of the vowels Mysty starts summing up the ingredients: \u201cSaaalt, Peppeeer, Vinegaaar, Sooooy Sauce\u201d.\n\nAny chili?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat else would make it turn so red in color?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Koooleeeh!\u201d Mysty informs me in a matter-of-fact voice.\n\nKooleh? Is that some kind of a plant?\u201d\n\nMysty and Madonna erupt in laughter.\n\nNo! No plant! Don\u2019t you know Kooleh?\u201d\n\nHow do you spell that?\u201d\n\nC O O L A I D!\u201d\n\nHence I learn that the secret ingredient to this traditional recipe is the powder of synthetic instant lemonade that doesn\u2019t only require water to get transformed into a barely potable substance, but also copious amounts of sugar. Now it\u2019s my turn to laugh.\n\nWhat flavor then?\u201d I want to know.\n\nWhy, tropical of course!\u201d\n\nOf course!\n\nAs the boat slowly maneuvers its way through the many shallow coral banks Peleliu becomes smaller and smaller in our wake. Sometimes the captain\u2019s arm comes shooting out of the window and points at a shadow under the surface of the water. Sharks! There are many around these islands. Some members of the crew have lowered fishing lines into the water, hoping that something will bite. And it does! After only twenty minutes a couple of sizeable fish are lying on deck, wriggling in their death throes.\n\nWhere you from?\u201d Mysty asks. \u201cIn your country do you have marijuana?\u201d\n\nYes we do, but it doesn\u2019t grow in the open. The climate doesn\u2019t allow for that.\u201d\n\nOn Peleliu, we have loooooots of it, and huuuuge! It grows everywhere!\u201d Mysty says proudly. \u201cYou want?\u201d\n\nA joint appears out of nowhere. I politely decline. Mysty looks at me funny, and lights up. The salty air in the lagoon mixes with the scent of weed. The boat sways gently in the waves as the joint gets passed around between Mysty, Madonna, and Fluffy Larry.\n\nWhat do you study?\u201d I ask.\n\nI study Tourism: Food and Drink!\u201d Mysty explains unenthusiastically. \u201cMadonna studies Criminal Justice\u201d.\n\nOh! Judge Madonna!\u201d I attempt another friendly tease.\n\nNo! Lawyer!\u201d Madonna sneers back. Mysty laughs and draws from the joint in her hand.\n\nSo why you came to Palau?\u201d they direct a question back at me.\n\nI heard it is beautiful, and I like Pacific island nations a lot. I\u2019ve been to quite a few. Also, many people, me included, enjoy seeing scenery different to the one they are familiar with!\u201d\n\nOh. But where is your wife, your kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo have!\u201d I reply. \u201cI like to be free!\u201d\n\nMysty nods and gives me two thumbs up. I\u2019m not sure if she means it. With her free hand she digs into her handbag and pulls out a small plastic bag.\n\nYou want Betel?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m running out of good excuses. Watching the otherworldly beautiful scenery slowly pass before my eyes I soak in the deliciously salty ocean air, listen to the monotonous hum of the diesel engine, and relax with the rhythm of the waves that rock the boat ever so gently. This is all the drugs I need to make me happy.\n\nShort before reaching the dock in Koror someone pinches my shoulder and I snap out of my hypnosis.\n\nHey! You want this?\u201d\n\nMysty drops some M+M\u2019s into my right hand. Now that\u2019s more like it!\n\n\nFor yet another story with lots of pictures from Palau check out this link:\n\nStickman's thoughts:\n\nA most interesting report!\n\nYou sure have a most interesting life and see some incredibly interesting places. There's few people who have a lifestyle that I am truly envious of \u2013 but you would be one of them!",

        "text":"Book Serialisation\n\n\u2018We cycle-travellers are rich beyond measure. Because we have all the time in the\u00a0world\u2019\n\nMidday in the Sahara. There\u2019s no-one to be seen. I push my bike amongst the outlying buildings. All is silence.\n\nA small boy darts from nowhere and makes a snatch at my trailer\u2019s tattered flag. I yell at him, he yells something back into the bright heat and darts away again \u2013\u00a0gone.\n\nI hear the squeal and clang of a metal door and follow the sound, emerging from between the low houses and courtyards and onto what I guess is the main street; a slightly wider piece of desert between the mud-walled compounds. So this is a Nubian village. It is hot and sunny; eerily quiet. Obviously. Who\u2019d be outside in this weather?\n\nPadding towards a doorway across the street, I almost walk into the young man who steps out as I approach. If he\u2019s surprised to bump into a grimy sunburned tramp wandering through his village, he hides it very well. More faces peer out from what I can now see is a little shop; men in purest white, women colourfully wrapped, stepping outside to meet me, all smiling broadly. This smile seems to be something of a permanent feature of the Nubians. With some exaggerated miming I explain that I am ill, desperate, and looking for a place to\u00a0rest.\n\nImmediate hilarity ensues and the entire village springs into life. Calls to action bounce down the street like squash balls: suddenly there are people everywhere. I\u2019m ushered through a gate into one of the nearby compounds. Enclosed by a thick high wall of Nile mud, robust as concrete in the heat of the desert, the house I find inside is big and spacious. Little distinction is made between indoors and out \u2013 windows, doorways and arches have been carved from the dry walls, some areas roofed with palm-branch lattices, and the entire structure is painted in white, yellow and blue, appealingly simple in appearance. The young man introduces his three colleagues: civil engineers from faraway Khartoum, working on the new road. They will be my hosts, he says, for as long as I remain in need of a place to\u00a0stay.\n\nI\u2019m shown to a spare bed, where I sit quietly and think, left for a moment to my own devices. I have been asked for no money in return for this hospitality. Yet the place is not a wealthy one; whatever my personal budget and notions of frugality, there\u2019s little doubt that I have come here bearing the riches of kings. Should I offer something by way of thanks? Or would doing so strip away that human altruism that has brought such joy to my journey? Before I can find an answer to that question, my hosts return, and I am whisked off on a tour of the\u00a0area.\n\nThe village sits beside a stripe of fertile land that reaches down to the banks of the Nile, criss-crossed with irrigation channels, dotted with stands of tall date palms and cultivated with wheat and beans. The little fields are fed by rusty diesel-powered pumps that are occasionally fired up to fill the channels with river water. Next come the house visits; I am a source of curiosity in Wawa, and I\u2019m passed from family to family for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nAt the end of the day I find myself sharing a communal hang-out in the village centre with a handful of men. The TV is on, beaming images of crisis from around the world into this tiny dwelling in the desert. The day after I\u2019d received my visa to enter Sudan from the country\u2019s embassy back in Cairo, the international community had issued an arrest warrant for Omar Al-Bashir, the President of Sudan, over the small issue of several hundred thousand deaths and the displacement of two-and-a-half million of his own people. This was merely the latest set of figures to give the illusion that Sudan\u2019s eternal conflicts were somehow quantifiable. The following day, all visas were off. I could call myself lucky to have got that green sticker, if it weren\u2019t grotesque to mention good fortune at all in the light of the events that led to such a decree.\n\nAnd I think of none of this, because I\u2019m sitting in the cool shade, drinking tea and laughing with strangers. And the sun sinks below the skyline in the ravaged, war-torn, peaceful and hospitable country of\u00a0Sudan.\n\n\nI wish.\n\nI wish \u2026 I could be doing this with Tenny. I have to say\u00a0it.\n\nThis is such a fantastic experience. But I really \u2026 I really wish I could be sharing it with her. It would be so good to be able to do this with,\u00a0er\u00a0\u2026\n\nYeah \u2013 with the woman who I\u00a0love.\n\nI know that right now it\u2019s not possible. I know that, but it doesn\u2019t make any difference: I\u2019m always thinking about it. Always. Always thinking about her, being with her \u2026 that moment when I see her\u00a0again.\u00a0\n\nAnd every time I have an experience, whether it\u2019s good or bad, I\u2019m always thinking: it would be so good \u2013 it would be so good to be sharing this, even if it\u2019s a bad experience, it would be so good to be sharing it with\u00a0Tenny.\n\nI don\u2019t regret doing\u00a0this.\u00a0\n\nBut it would make such a big difference to be doing it with\u00a0her.\u00a0\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I want to say, really.\u00a0\n\nPage Divider\n\n\u2018You look\u00a0tired!\u2019\n\n\u2018Huh? Ah. Yeah. We slept in a park last night. Just down there.\u2019 Mark pointed wearily down the lakeside promenade to a grassy, tree-studded park, where a group of Swiss youths were setting up a game of bowls, unaware that the green had until a few minutes ago been somebody\u2019s bedroom.\n\n\u2018Aha! You\u2019re going\u00a0far?\u2019\n\n\u2018Round the world!\u2019 we mumbled in chorus.\n\n\u2018Mmm. Well,\u2019 grinned the slender grey-haired lady, \u2018I\u2019ve also been on a kind of \u201cworld tour\u201d. So, if you\u2019re not in a rush, I\u2019d like to invite you to my place. We can chat. You can rest. You can spend the day there if you like? Stay the night, even. It\u2019s no trouble.\u2019\n\nInvitations like this had become a frequent feature of our journey across Western Europe. By far the most effective method of eliciting them had been to ask plainly for help \u2013 for a water-bottle refill, or, if we were feeling lucky, for a spot to pitch our tents. Mark had become the designated door-knocker after a brilliant early run in the Netherlands, where we\u2019d made this astonishing discovery. Putting on a happily clueless face, he would unveil his goatee, put on a cycling headband that looked to the untrained eye like a fluorescent-yellow sock, and amble vaguely towards his quarry. And the sight of this pitiful creature seemed to awaken the hospitality buried in every human\u00a0being.\n\nIt may also have been that he didn\u2019t take things this as seriously as I did. For me, stopping a passer-by or knocking on a door was a sign of weakness. The journey I\u2019d always imagined was supposed to be a demonstration of self-sufficiency, and my hesitant approaches seemed to put people off. But as far as Mark was concerned, he was just asking for help. And by doing so, he had become responsible for a staggering list of back gardens, garage floors, spare rooms and sofas on which we had spent our nights since we had vowed in that leaky Amsterdam hostel to abandon paid accommodation entirely. These encounters had been diverse; our hosts revealed a dazzling array of hobbies and professions and views on the world. And, in that way, farmers, plumbers, school teachers, conservationists, diplomats, judges, newspaper editors, blacksmiths, businessmen, translators, potters, water-polo coaches, vagrants and violinists had become part of the journey I\u2019d always imagined would be about sweat, strain, mountains, forests, wild camps, sunsets and the purest form of independence.\n\nMirella\u2019s unexpected invitation was unusual in that it had arrived unsolicited \u2013 and at seven-thirty in the morning. As we waited on the lakeside wall while she ran some errands, I wondered what kind of \u2018world tour\u2019 she\u2019d been on. It wasn\u2019t likely to compare to what we were doing, of course, but it would be fun to hear about it anyway. Soon we found ourselves cycling behind our unexpected host into the terraced suburbs of Montreux, where we weaved up the steep and crooked alleys to Mirella\u2019s home. We wheeled our bikes into the garage, paused briefly to admire the wizened old touring steeds that rested inside, and followed her into a house full of airy rooms and natural light; a monument to simplicity, overlooking Lake Geneva \u2013 the most beautiful bathroom on Earth, she\u00a0said.\n\nMirella unpacked her shopping in the kitchen and quietly explained that she\u2019d spent a total of twelve years on the road with her husband, over the course of three separate world tours. India, Australia, Tibet, China, Yemen, Oman \u2013 the roll-call went on, but without a hint that she was merely ticking off a list of countries. Her ride hadn\u2019t hinged upon big distances or impressive-sounding continental crossings, and she clearly didn\u2019t think herself superior as a result of her achievements. The Italian-born nurse was in her fifties and had only recently returned to Switzerland after eight continuous years of life on the world\u2019s back roads, finishing her ride back into Europe by following the River Danube as we were planning to do on our way towards Asia.\n\nHer husband Luc, she said, was in Taiwan on a photography assignment, and if the couple had children who\u2019d grown up and left home, Mirella didn\u2019t mention them. While we slumped half-asleep in the sitting-room, not quite knowing what to make of our chance encounter, she cooked us a lunch of spaghetti alla Bolognese and watched in amusement as we shovelled vast quantities of it down our throats. I couldn\u2019t comprehend what she\u2019d done, try as I might, my world already in a spin after only four weeks on the\u00a0road.\n\nTwelve years.\n\n\u2018So,\u2019 enquired Mirella as we finished off the last of the pasta, \u2018what kind of distances are you guys doing each\u00a0day?\u2019\n\nThe question came with a tilt of inquisitiveness. But there was something else beneath it. Was it suspicion? Amusement? The question was a test, designed to reveal something about the way we were conducting our journey \u2013 something that we thought was superficial, but that would tell her a great\u00a0deal.\n\n\u2018Hmm \u2026 about seventy or eighty kilometres on aver...

        "text":"Tuesday September 13\n\nParis is a full belly, the Metro subterranean blood vessels stretching beneath taut skin carrying sight-devouring tourists from attraction to attraction. Normally I\u2019m only in Paris for a couple of days and a sense of urgency keeps me underground on the Metro. But as this visit is longer time is affoded to walk. It\u2019s a surprise to find that Place de la Madelaine, Place Vendome and Place Concorde are just minutes apart on foot. Place Vendome, where Lady Di left the Ritz and then crashed. Place Concorde where Marie-Antoinette lost her head. Paris can be rough on royalty. When the history of violence is written, Paris will be good for a couple of chapters. Templar Knights burnt at the stake, bishops tortured on the grill, St Dennis carrying his martyred head through the streets of Montmartre, The Terror, The Commune, the Gestapo knocking on your door, Lady Di\u2019s car crash. The sun sets over Concorde.\n\nWednesday, September 14\n\nJacqueline\u2019s three-hour train journey from Nancy to Gare de l\u2019Est is delayed by one hour and fifteen minutes \u201cdu a un acte de malveillance.\u201d We buy a sandwich and wait. A young man asks customers at the bar for money. He is quietly agitated. A pigeon glides into the entry hall and lands on the floor. It is the same colour and pattern as the marble tiles. The pigeon has been painted by Rene Magritte. Jacqueline\u2019s train arrives. She looks frail.\n\nThursday, September 15\u00a0\n\nColette takes us to La Taroudant II, a Tunisian restaurant in rue Capucine. Colette had worked in Tunisia and knows the food.\n\nCouscous au mechoui avec merguez\nVin marocain rose (guerrouane)\nDesert \u2013 le mystere (ice cream)\n\nWe sit amongst flashing fairy lights, tiles like Byzantine mosaics, brass teapots, stained glass lampshades, long barrelled rifles and daggers. Joelle, Jacqueline and Colette dip sugar cubes into fig liquor. La Tarouant II is named after an oasis.\n\nThe bell rings at the cemetery, its 5.45 pm, time for visitors to leave. The sun will be setting in 2 hours. 7.30 pm sitting on a bench on the corner of rue Des Saules and rue Cortot with the Nikon on my lap, I\u2019m asked if I know where Vincent Van Gogh lived.\n\nAround the corner at 54 rue Lepic.\nI\u2019m asked what I\u2019m doing?\nI\u2019m waiting for the streetlights to come on.\nI\u2019m told last night they came on at 8.15 pm.\n\nFriday, September 16\n\nThe sky is grey it\u2019s raining. The walk long to rue du Quatre Septembre and the Bourse. The rain is steady so into the Monoprix to buy an umbrella. A scrawny young man talks to the matronly cash register operator. He is quietly spoken and repeats his request a couple of times. She finally understands. He wants sex she says. The French flag on the roof of the Bourse spoils the Greek temple look and the drizzling rain continues all the way back to avenue Rachel.\n\nLunch is with Bertrand at well worn and authentic Restaurant Tifinagh. High school students hand rolling cigaretttes occupy one table and a couple occupies another. The woman is from Brassai\u2019s book, The Secret Paris of the 30s. She has peroxide green hair, smokes tailor made cigarettes from a red packet and is wearing an over designed pink leather jacket. She never smiles as she talks. Her male companion nods between bites of cake off a fork. She is probably a local. I see her up at rue Lepic a few days later.\n\nA huge full moon rises over Sacre \u2013 Coeur.",
