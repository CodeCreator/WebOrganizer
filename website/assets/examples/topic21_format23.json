        "text":"SkiPulk Fat-Bike Pulk Kit Review by -JP Syverud-\n\n\nLast January we introduced you to the SkiPulk FatBike Pulk Kit.\u00a0 The version we received in the test lab came with the original orange Paris pulk, a black Paris duffle bag, a mountable seat post hitch, and 2 fiberglass poles. Here is the link to the product spotlight for all the specs and initial thoughts.\n\n\n\nAfter 3 months of pulking fun, we\u2019re going to take a look at how the\u00a0SkiPulk Fat Bike Pulk Kit has held up over the long haul. No pun intended! I\u2019ve not only used the pulk kit for play but for bike-packing and actual work up North at my cabin. The SkiPulk has delivered 3 months of solid work performance in various conditions. My favorite use was off-road adventuring. It was an integral part of my Bivy Challenges in the winter months to help haul wood and gear to my campsites.\n\n\n\nI won\u2019t lie; I will shed a few tears when I turn this kit in.\u00a0 But, I will definitely purchase one of these for myself in the near future.\u00a0 I will start saving my pennies for a few other items to add to it.\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to the Fat Bike Pulk kit, I would buy 2 additional accessories. The first accessory to purchase is the Removable Fin Kit. The removable fins are made of heavy-duty aluminum.\u00a0 They help keep the sled on track in deep powder conditions and hilly terrain.\u00a0 They can be mounted on the pulk and moved inside the sled when not needed. \u00a0The second accessory I would purchase is the Expedition Harness.\u00a0 \u00a0The harness comes in handy if the snow gets too deep. \u00a0It could be used to strap the bike to the top by attaching the poles to the harness.\u00a0 You can trudge on foot to your destination. \u00a0Being stranded with this setup is really not possible.\n\n\n\nI have used this pulk in numerous winter conditions. Icy lakes, deep powder fields, single track, double track, gravel roads, and even some groomed snowmobile tracks. \u00a0It handled exceptionally well in every environment. I was a little hesitant using it on my carbon seat posts at first, but, Grant from SkiPulk assured me that others have used their carbon seat posts with no issues.\u00a0 He was correct. \u00a0I made sure to tighten the bolts slowly to so I didn\u2019t cause any damage to the seat post.\u00a0 No issues at all.\n\n\n\nI really liked using this pulk setup ice fishing on the lakes.\u00a0 Not only can you haul all of your gear, but you get some very strange looks.\u00a0 Be prepared, you will get asked lots of questions by the locals.\u00a0 Nothing is more fun than pulling up to a flannel-clad Wisconsin ice-fisherman and asking if you can poach one of his holes.\u00a0 I have done this in the past but now with a setup like this, you can actually haul out your own auger.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to be a hole poacher any longer!\u00a0 I recommend studded tires when gallivanting around on the ice to avoid sliding out of control.\n\n\n\nAnother great use for this pulk was grooming some of the local single- track trails for my local biking group.\u00a0 The weight distribution felt really good and the pulk was stable and tracked really well.\u00a0 It glided effortlessly with a full cooler and 2 cases of beer for ballast.\n\n\nRacer \u2013 Alan Myers taking advantage of my mobile Bloody Mary Bar at the Sweaty Yeti\n\n\nThe durability of the poles was outstanding, despite carrying a heavy load and falling on a tricky technical section of trail.\u00a0 The poles did not snap.\u00a0 Instead, the poles bent and held up beautifully. I did find by crossing the poles it made the Pulk track better behind the bike in single-track conditions.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t seem to sway off course at all. The most entertaining thing I did with the SkiPulk was to use it as a mobile Bloody Mary Station at the Sweaty Yeti Fat Bike Race at Levis Mounds, in Neillsville WI.\u00a0 I loaded up all the fixings and pulled it around the course and convenient stops for \u201cracer aid and support.\u201d It was a hit.\n\n\n\nThe only drawback that I could find to this entire system is the weight of the hitch.\u00a0 The hitch weighs in at 2.5 pounds of stainless steel.\u00a0 But that is not necessarily a bad thing.\u00a0 It is bombproof.\u00a0 It is definitely what I would want if I were crossing Antarctica.\u00a0 \u00a0If you are being a weight weenie with a thirty-pound fat bike hauling 100 pounds of gear, then you have other issues you may want to address with a professional. I wish the plastic sleeve around the hitch was a bit longer so it covered the entire contact point, but that\u2019s all just cosmetic.\u00a0 This will not affect the system in any way.\u00a0 The thickness of the plastic sleeve makes sure the metal hitch portion will not scratch the finish on your seatposts. Big thanks to Grant and Ashley from SkiPulk, and Uncle Gomez for setting me up with 3 months of pulling goodness.\u00a0 This fat-bike pulk kit has performed admirably and held up to a lot of abuse.\u00a0 I give it a healthy 4.5 \/5 flaming gnome rating!\n\nTo learn more about this and other ski-pulk products visit them on the interwebs at www.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, , , , , , , ,\n\nNo comments yet.\n\nLeave a Reply",

Started climbing at 06:40, topped out at 10am. 3.5hrs on route. Moved together all the way. Probably 12-15 teams behind us! Walked down to Gianetti hut for pasta and coffee lunch then walked down to Bagni del Masino for 16:00.\nchapmand - AltLd O\/S - 03\/Aug\/15 with Ian Stewart\n\nSir Stefan - AltLd - 17\/Jul\/15 with Niels Riegels\n\nkrispy_fish2000 - AltLd O\/S - 14\/Jul\/15\n\nRichard Goodey - Jul\/15\n\nGot about a third of the way up before a storm rolled in and we had to bail. Great climbing up to there and pretty straightforward on the whole - easy slab climbing with regular ring bolts to clip for runners while moving together. The snow patches were just about passable in trainers, without crampons or axe but an axe between two to chop steps might have been a bit more pleasant. Will definitely be back for this one and the Cassin.\nRob84 - Lead dnf - 08\/Aug\/14 with Mel\n\nAb back down took longer.

I do not recommend that walk, horrible!! Loose choss on sloping ledges. If I'm up there again, staying in the bivi hut on the summit and descending the ridge the following day would be a much better option. Ridge was fantastic though! Moved together for all of it, though rope drag shortened a few sections significantly. Don't think it was much faster than pitching it efficiently, but possibly more fun :)\nmaria85 - AltLd O\/S - 05\/Sep\/13 with Jules\n\nUisdean hawthorn - 01\/Sep\/13\n\nI was a bit too tired to appreciate the views from the top.\nKirill - AltLd - 21\/Aug\/13 with Stevo\n\nUp the north ridge (7 ish hours) and down the same side (6 ish hours). For descent mixture of down climbing and abseiling to the top of Another Day in Paradise, you can't simply ab down the north ridge on brass ring bolts, the shape of the ridge doesn't allow this and I think some of the ring bolts are more than 50 metres apart and not in the logical place for repeated abseiling, despite what the Chris Mellor guide says). Then 14 abseils down Another Day In Paradise which I guess was quite risky given we can't climb F6c! However we did have another party behind and in front of us that could! A long tiring but very satisfying day with very good weather and views. We started scrambling up to the start from our bivi at dawn and came back to the same spot at dusk and walked back out getting to the campsite at around midnight, having got up at 5 am! We only moved together for the first 2 pitches, and around 4 higher up as well as for most of the scrambling to the summit after the last pitch.\nCurlyStevo - AltLd - Aug\/13 with Kirill S\n\nWe decided to climb as much as we could setting a limited of reaching as high as possible by 1pm. By 2:18pm we reached the exit area for another day in paradise, We weren't quite sure where we were, thinking we were at the top of the technical climbing we decided to ab back down as my partner wanted to be back in Bondo that night. Not seeing this as dnf but not perhaps the start of something new in my climbing. Still amazing climbing up to this point nothing difficult just bold.\nmatthomas79 - 30\/Jul\/13 with Paul Lee\n\nlong, abseil descent not so bad if you stick to the ridge\/rings. advise twin 60s, lots of stations could be skipped on way up and down.\nGuyVG - AltLd O\/S - 26\/Jul\/13 with oli\n\nAbseil retreat around halfway up after rain and hail made further progress problematic to say the least. Still lots of snow on the approach - crampons and ice axe necessary\nAJH - 18\/Jul\/13 with Keith\n\nwherewelf - Jul\/13\n\nTdavy01 - Jul\/13\n\nRickrick - Jul\/13\n\nnking100 - 2013\n\nin descent\nalasdair19 - 2013\n\nAwesome Climb. 4 and a bit hour ascent.

Feet were like hambergers at the bottom. Nice beer in the hut, back at the car by 5.15 and just in time for a pizza from the Stone Bar back in Argentiere before 10.\nCham32 - Aug\/11\n\nbenclimbing - AltLd O\/S - Aug\/11 with Dave Latimer\n\nTried to do this route earlier in the trip but we were caught in a thunderstorm during the walk in the night before. After getting soaked and sleeping in very wet tents we woke up to bad weather so had to head down the mountain without trying the route. On second attempt we Bivviied the night before the climb and then got about 3\/4 up before the weather closed in. Having no wish to be caught in a second storm on the Badille we started descent at 11am via abseil. The descent took 4+ hours not including the 3 or 4 hour walk down the mountain.\nlibby.southgate - AltLd - 12\/Jul\/11 with Emily Roo\n\nHidden - AltLd O\/S - 12\/Jul\/11\n\nhad been hoping to do the cassin but conditions didnt allow, moved together, then abbed the ridge, not nearly as bad as some make out, abbing on one rope helps stop faff, 10 hours up and down.\nGinger McGrath - AltLd O\/S - 11\/Jul\/11 with phil emerson\n\njonnie3430 - Lead O\/S - 11\/Jul\/11 with Marie\n\nHidden - AltLd - Jul\/11\n\nHidden - AltLd rpt - Jun\/11\n\nIt's easy to underestimate the climbing on this route. Most pitches seemed to have a hard move or two, so we pitched the whole thing. 12 hours from col to summit (for competent VS climbers). Bivied on way down. Longest and best thing I've ever led for sure.\nPero - Lead - 04\/Sep\/10\n\nFantastic, but took about 10 hours, finishing about 5pm. Not enough time for Swiss descent, so attempted to get to Rif.

Straight away I was impress by their quality of the manufacturing. The UltrAspire are in a class of their own when it comes to the make of the belts. They are really beautifully designed. The UltrAspire Running Belts are the best running belt that I have seen on the market so far. I\u2019ve worn the UltrAspire packs before and I love them. I was keen to try their running belts and see how they stand up to the riggers of trail running. Continue Reading",

We did the first two hours as a easy ride we got past the damn and stopped for lunch at the Birmingham road bridge. Then it got tough as the water level was very low and there were a lot of trees down that we normally go right over with good water. We cut some of them out of the way but there are many left. Then with about an hour left in the trip one of the Pungos seat straps broke so we had to rig that back up. Then we went back to work on the trip and more clearing. The whole trip took about four hours of paddling but when I got home and everything put away it was more like eight hours as per the Wife. If any one wants to do the trip now I would say go for it but there are some spots that a big or long boats would have problems because of fallen trees. Have Fun.\n\n\nWe met at the Vincetown Dinner at the corner of Route 38 and 206 and 530 then went west on route 206 to the first street on the right (it say Smithville). Go up that road until you see a bridge turn left just before and the take out is there. Then go back towards the Dinner stay on 206 it turns into 530 follow that about a mile the road turns to the left just before a bridge and there will be a small drive way that goes to the left take that to the ramp.\n\n\nCanoeing the Jersey Pine Barrens\n\nShow All NJ Reports - Submit Your Report\n\n\u00a0Great Products from the Buyers' Guide:\n\nKindle \/ iPad Cases\n\nKayak Seats\n\nRescue \/ Throw Bags\n\nThe Kayak Wing\n\nKayak Motor Kit\n\nFollow us on:\nFree Newsletter | About Us | Site Map | Advertising Info | Contact Us\n\n\u00a92014 Inc.\nSweepstakes Banjo Shirt",

        "text":"Mondraker Foxy \u00a31699\n\nSpanish trail tamer\n\nBikeRadar score 2.5\/5\n\nThe new-for-2010 Mondraker Foxy features the Spanish company's Zero short-link suspension system delivering 140mm of travel. This is the base bike \u2013 higher-specced (and more expensive) Foxy R and RR models round out the range.\n\nThe Foxy feels like a pocket downhill bike, with a low-slung top tube, relaxed front end and suspension with rather more recommended sag than most. However, the RockShox Ario shock is no match for the Fox units on most other bikes at this price.\n\nRide and handling: Low-slung and chuckable but needs plenty of rocks and roots to really shine\n\nMondraker's shallow-fronted geometry and low-slung frame encourages the kind of attacking style that pretty much ensures you're hitting things hard and fast. That's a good thing, because the RockShox Ario shock is something of liability, lending the back end a rather wooden and stunted feeling. It put one of our testers in mind of one of Proflex's uninspired lumps of urethane from days of yore.\n\nThe RockShox Recon fork isn't too bad \u2013 it lacks fluidity, but a more supple fork wouldn't do the back end any favours. The regular quick-release axle looks out of place compared to the bolt-through options on most other bikes at this price, though.\n\nIt's a shame, because the frame and suspension design are fundamentally sound \u2013 with a more capable shock in there we suspect that the Foxy would be very good indeed, making the most of the \u201cpocket downhill bike\u201d feel. There's an upside to the slightly unyielding shock, though \u2013 the bike is impressively stable under power.\n\nBuild the steepness, speed and scale of rocks and the Foxy starts to come alive. The consensus was that there's a lot of potential in the Mondraker, but that you'd do best to look further up the range to realise it.\n\nFrame: Effective steep rear\/slack front geometry makes for a fun ride\n\nThere's a strong family resemblance between the different models in the Mondraker line, with the Foxy sharing the humpbacked top tube and angular back end of the Summum downhill race bike. Although the tubes are a little smaller, there's still an air of robustness thanks to the big flared 1.125\/1.5in headtube and girthsome square-section down tube.\n\nAt the bottom bracket the tube gives way to a four-legged forged section that accommodates Mondraker's short-link rear end. The floating shock sits inside and is attached to both links, while a direct-mount front mech is bolted to the trailing edge of one of the legs.\n\nSizing is slightly curious, with the Foxy available in M, L and XL. That makes it appear that shorter riders are out of luck, but given that the M test bike measured under 17in centre-to-top with a 22.8in top tube, it\u2019s probably worth trying one even if your usual ride is described as \u201csmall\u201d.\n\nEquipment: Budget suspension parts hinder performance\n\nWith the entry-level Foxy sharing a frame with the spendier R and RR models, Mondraker have had to make a few compromises to hit the attractive \u00a31,750 price point. The most obvious is the Recon fork and Ario shock. Elsewhere you'll find a SRAM X-5\/X-7 transmission and Truvativ Firex cranks.\n\nThe compact yet effective Formula K18 brakes are a highlight. There's plenty of Mondraker's own-brand Onoff kit, including the wheels, but it's all dependable enough. Kenda Blue Groove tyres are a popular choice, but the 2.1 size is a little undernourished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\nBack to top",

Was this review helpful?\n\nQuality How is the quality? Does it have every feature you need? Seems well built and should last several seasons. Features What do you like or dislike about the features? I like the idea of a quick break instead of wringing necks, but I tried several times squeezing hard on a Canada goose and it wouldn't break it's neck. Cost Do you think this item is a good value? It was $2. As long as it breaks duck necks, it is for me. Flyway Which flyway do you hunt in? Central Overall Please give your general opinion of this product. I wouldn't recommend on big geese, but should do the trick for smaller geese, ducks, and upland game.",
