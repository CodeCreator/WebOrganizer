        "text":"2019 Caravaglio Infatata Malvasia Secca Salina\n\n$ 22.99\n\nWe currently have 12 in stock.\n\nThis fascinating wine hails from the Aeolian island of Salina near Sicily in southern Italy. Grown on volcanic soils, this is made of 100% Malvasia Bianco and is vinified completely dry. Exotic and intensely perfumed, this wine opens with vibrant lychee, pineapple and honeysuckle notes on the nose and leads to a salty, lean, mineral palate that speaks of its island origins.\n\nFew places in the world embody the philosophy of natural winemaking as effortlessly as does Salina, where Antonino Caravaglio crafts his peerless wines by hand. Part of the Aeolian Island chain off the coast of Sicily, Salina is a slice of paradise, created by volcanoes and carved by the Mediterranean winds. Caravaglio makes what he calls \u201cisland\u201d wines, choosing to ferment on indigenous yeasts and limit the addition of sulfur, all so that Salina\u2019s natural character\u2014its volcanic soils, its sea-salty air, its wild herbs\u2014is exactly what you taste and savor in each rare bottle.\n\nVINEYARDS: On the island of Salina, the single-vineyard \u2018Tricoli\u2019 is shaped like a triangle and stretches up a steep slope, from the Mediterranean coast into the clouds, facing northwest. It is located in the Malfa district (the highest quality vine-growing area on the island). Soils are a combination of volcanic sand and rock.\n\nAGE OF VINES: 10 to 20 years\n\nWINEMAKING: Hand-harvested and sorted in the fields. Gentle, full-cluster press; fermented on indigenous yeasts in temperature-controlled, stainless steel tanks. Aged in tank on fine lees for three months.\n\nTASTING IMPRESSIONS: Aromas of cardamom-spiced pears, white peach, preserved lemon; plush, complex yet balanced\n\nItaly, Sicily, Salina Bianco\n100% Malvasia delle Lipari\n\nAn adult signature is required upon delivery, so please keep that in mind when shipping this gift to friends, family and peers.\nThere is no minimum.\nBottles are in perfect condition.",
