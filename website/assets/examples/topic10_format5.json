        "text":"Frequently-asked questions:\n\n  \u2022 How do you say \u201cph\u1edf\/b\u00fan\/b\u00e1nh m\u00ec\/etc.\u201d?\n    The short answer is, however you like. While we are owned by a Vietnamese family, we are neither purists nor snobs when it comes to pronunciation. We encourage you to use whatever pronunciation you feel comfortable with, or to keep it simple and use the numbers provided on our menu.\n\n    Of course, if you\u2019re interested in learning for learning\u2019s sake, there are many online references that you can use. Click here for a short video (51 sec, YouTube) that demonstrates how to say the names of some common Vietnamese meal items (some, but not all, of which we offer).\n\n  \u2022 Are you part of Pho (insert number here)?\/Are all you Pho restaurants a chain?\n    We are an independent enterprise (see our \u201cAbout Us\u201d page for more details on our story). We are family-owned and family-operated and are not, nor have we ever been, associated with any pho restaurant chain. \u201cPh\u1edf\u201d is the Vietnamese name for our noodle soup in beef broth, and many ph\u1edf restaurants have names ending in numbers (see our page on ph\u1edf restaurant numbers for more information!).\n\n    On dietary restrictions:\n\n  \u2022 What are your vegetarian\/vegan-friendly items?\n    Our A7 (Cucumber Salad) and S8 (B\u00e1nh M\u00ec Chay) are inherently vegetarian (S8 is vegan if ordered without Vietnamese mayo). Items that can be adjusted to be vegetarian\/vegan are the A6 (Papaya Salad), B4 (B\u00fan Chay\u2014vegetarian dry rice noodles), and C4 (C\u01a1m Chay\u2014vegetarian rice plate) if ordered without the n\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea5m sauce. If you adhere to a strict meat-free diet or lifestyle, please inform our servers and the kitchen will triple-check your ingredients for you.\n\n    We regret that none of our soups are currently being made with a vegetarian broth. For more information, please see our answer below about why we do not serve any soups with vegetable broth.\n\n  \u2022 What menu items are good for gluten-sensitive\/gluten-free eaters?\n    Fortunately, all of our ph\u1edf, b\u00fan, and rice (c\u01a1m) dishes come gluten-free by default. Our housemade chili paste, chili oil, and n\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea5m sauce, as well as the Sriracha we carry, is also gluten-free. Unfortunately, our hoisin sauce (the dark sauce at the tables) is not gluten-free, nor is the peanut dipping sauce for our summer rolls (A2). Our sandwich baguettes are made with wheat and rice flour and are not gluten-free. Please inform your server of any dietary restrictions, and we will gladly triple-check any ingredients that go into your food to ensure that you can safely enjoy it.\n\n  \u2022 I\u2019m on a low-carb\/carb-free diet. What can I eat at Ph\u1edf 83?\n    Depending on the amount of carbs allowed in your diet, you may still be able to indulge in the occasional treat of one of our regular menu items. However, we do have some low-carb options, and some of our menu items can be adjusted to be lower in carbohydrates. For example, our Vietnamese-style chicken wings, chicken salad, papaya salad, and cucumber salad are relatively (not completely) lower-carb.\n\n    We can also do any of our soups over steamed bean sprouts instead of rice or egg noodles for a lower-carb alternative, if requested. Instead of rice noodles or rice for our b\u00fan and c\u01a1m dishes, we can serve your protein of choice over a light mix of fresh vegetables on request as well. We encourage you to ask your server about alternatives, and our kitchen will always go the extra mile to try and work with you.\n\n  \u2022 I\u2019m lactose-intolerant\/dairy-free. Is Ph\u1edf 83 good for me?\n    Yes. Our only menu items with dairy are our Vietnamese coffee (with sweetened condensed milk only) and bubble milk tea.\n\n  \u2022 Why don\u2019t you serve vegetarian ph\u1edf?\n    While we have nothing against our vegetarian or vegan friends and do offer several vegetarian\/vegan options (see our menu for more details), we have not yet been able to create a vegetarian ph\u1edf broth that meets our very high culinary expectations. We have too much respect for our meat-free customers to take advantage of their dietary restrictions by selling them a substandard product and will not offer a \u201cveggie broth\u201d option until we can make something that tastes just as good as (or even better than!) our beef, chicken, or pork broths. If we ever do perfect a veggie ph\u1edf broth recipe, rest assured, we will let you know.\n\n    For now, please take note of menu items marked \u201cnon-vegetarian\u201d or \u201cvegetarian without ____\u201d and always inform your servers (even when making take-out orders) of any dietary restrictions so that we can accommodate you accordingly. We are always happy to take care of special requests!",

        "text":"Brave New World Grubhub.com.\n\nHi. We changed some things. Made some things different. Made a lot of things better. And now we\u2019re going to tell you about those things. And answer questions.\n\nSome content\n\nIs this Grubhub\u2019s new site?\n\nSort of. It\u2019s an upgraded version of the Grubhub you\u2019re used to. So, while the core functionality is nothing new, there are more than enough tweaks and new features built into to justify calling it \u201call new\u201d or \u201csparkling\u201d or whatever you want to call it.Also, it looks better. A lot better. Like our CEO after a haircut.\n\nWhat happened to the old site?\n\nUh\u2026 we replaced it with the new one? Why else would we have made a new one? It\u2019s like what people do with iPhones or Corollas, you know? Upgrade and never look back.\n\nIs the new Grubhub better? Or does it just look better?\n\nWe\u2019re upgrading plenty of things, and more features are coming soon. But, for now, yeah, it\u2019s better \u2013 filters are improved, search got an overhaul, and we\u2019re finally recommending things based on what people near you are in to.And, hey, thanks for saying it looks better. We thought so, too.\n\nI\u2019m not logged in automatically. What gives?\n\nWe upgraded our login, so you\u2019ll have to re-sign in the first time you use the new site.If you forget any of your details, the \u201cForgot your password\u201d button will get you all sorted out.\n\nWhat happened to [feature \u2018X\u2019]?\n\nTo be honest, we couldn\u2019t do a redesign without moving a few things around and tweaking some features. Each change we made was based on user feedback and expectations, but if you have any questions or concerns about various features, please send them in Red Feedback widget on the right side of your screen.\n\nWhat is Grubhub?\n\nMaybe we should have answered this question first? Anyway, we let you order food online from a lot of restaurants in a lot of cities around America. Like, 900+ cities and tens of thousands of restaurants.In short: if you want to order delivery or pickup, this is an easier way for you to do that from a huge variety of restaurants.\n\nHow do I order?\n\nYou enter your address and click \u201cSearch.\u201d You\u2019ll see a list of restaurants delivering to you, along with nearby pickup options. Click the one you\u2019re into, do the same for anything you\u2019re feeling on its menu and hit \u201cProceed to Checkout.\u201dDo that whole \u201cordering something on the Internet\u201d checkout thing and we\u2019ll notify the restaurant to begin prepping your food. Done.\n\nWhat happens after I submit an order?\n\nWe send your order to the restaurant as soon as you hit the button. The restaurant tells us they\u2019re working on the order, we email you a receipt and text you a confirmation.\n\nCan you stop the texting?\n\nYes, of course! Just reply to a confirmation with the word STOP. Heads up: if you use Google Voice, you\u2019ll need to reply directly through their site and\/or app.\n\nWhat if I don\u2019t receive an order confirmation email?\n\nCheck your spam folder, make sure your email account isn\u2019t acting weird, and, if all else fails, reach us on our Contact Us Page.\n\nHow do I change or cancel an order after I\u2019ve placed it?\n\nYou\u2019ll want to check our Contact Us Page.\n\nWho do I call to check on the status of my order?\n\nYou\u2019ll want to call the restaurant. Check your order confirmation email for their phone number. Or, if you\u2019d like, you can reach out to Grubhub\u2019s Customer Care team on our Contact Us Page.\n\nI have a confirmation email, but the restaurant says they don\u2019t have my order. What gives, Dr. Grub?\n\nIf you\u2019re hearing that they\u2019ve not received your order, reach us immediately on our Contact Us Page and we\u2019ll get things sorted out.\n\nSomething is wrong with my food. What do I do?\n\nIf there\u2019s a problem with your order, please call the restaurant and let them know. You can find that phone number in your order confirmation email.Of course, you can reach out to our Customer Care Team on our Contact Us Page.\n\nWe\u2019re around 24\/7 to fix these things.\n\nHow do I browse restaurants near me?\n\nThe best way is to make sure you enter your address as specifically as possible. The search results will be tailored to restaurants that deliver to that address or restaurants that are within a reasonable distance offering pickup.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with \u201cOrder History\u201d?\n\nHere\u2019s where you can see everything you\u2019ve ordered in the past. Which is helpful for a few reasons. One, you can reorder anything you loved in just a few clicks. Of course, you\u2019ll get the chance to edit the order to add anything else you\u2019d want or remove anything you don\u2019t need this time around. The second, of course, is to view and print receipts. If you\u2019re into that sort of thing, anyway.\n\nSo, what\u2019s it cost to use Grubhub?\n\nGrubhub is free to use. You\u2019ll have to pay for the food and, if you opt for delivery, you may notice that the restaurant charges a fee for delivery. In that case, the fee is set by the restaurant or the delivery service the restaurant utilizes and would apply even if you placed your order by phone.\n\nHow are the menu prices determined?\n\nThe restaurants we work with are contractually obligated to match the prices they have set on their menus. If you see any discrepancies, reach us on our Contact Us page and we\u2019ll talk to the restaurant.\n\nIs there a minimum amount I have to spend to order?\n\nIn some cases, yes. Restaurants often require a minimum order size to deliver an order.\n\nCan I save my payment information?\n\nYep. During checkout, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to save a credit card, add a credit card or remove a credit card.\n\nHow do I change my credit card information?\n\nTo change your credit card info, click \u201cyour name\u201d in the top right corner of the page. Options to edit your saved payment details are hiding in there.\n\nWhen is my credit card charged?\n\nYour card is charged as soon as you place your order, just as it would be when ordering over the phone.\n\nIs my payment info secure?\n\nYep. We never share any of these details with restaurants, and we encrypt everything the second you hit that \u201corder\u201d button. We use Verisign, which is the leader in SSL encryption, to make sure no one (including us) can see those details.\n\nDoes Grubhub offer gift cards?\n\nYes, we do. You can purchase Grubhub eGift Cards in a variety of amounts at www.grubhub.com\/giftcards. They can be customized, paired with personalized messages, and sent by email or printed out. And, eGift Cards can be redeemed right away or saved for later, since they never expire.\n\nHow do I redeem my Grubhub eGift Card?\n\nFollow these simple steps:\n\n  1. Decide what you want to eat and add it to your bag.\n  2. When you arrive at Checkout, redeem your Grubhub eGift Card by clicking the \u201cAdd gift cards and promo codes\u201d link.\n  3. Enter your eGift Card code in the field and click \"Apply.\"\n  4. We\u2019ll deduct your eGift Card balance from your order total, and you\u2019ll be able to use multiple eGift Cards per order.\n\nHow do I redeem a promo code?\n\nIf you have a promo code, you\u2019ll be able to enter it during checkout and we\u2019ll adjust your order total to factor in the discount. It\u2019s important to note here that you can only use one discount per order.\n\nI forgot my username. Or my password. Or both. What now?\n\nYour username is often the email address you would have used to register your account. As for the password, you can click the \u201cForgot My Password\u201d link and we\u2019ll get you sorted out.And if you still need a reminder of that username, the \u201cForgot Username\u201d button and the fields that pop up when you click it will trigger an email reminder of that name.\n\nCan I have two Grubhub accounts with the same email address?\n\nUnfortunately, no. Because that email is tied to your username, you can only have one account per email address.\n\nCan I save multiple addresses? Like \u201chome,\u201d \u201cwork,\u201d and \u201cfuture husband\u2019s\u201d?\n\nYep. Any address you use to place an order will be saved to your account. You can even label each one to make things easier.And if things don\u2019t work out with \u201cfuture husband,\u201d you can delete any stored addresses by clicking your name in the top right corner of the page (make sure you\u2019re logged in, of course!).\n\nCan I save special delivery instructions to my address?\n\nYou can, yeah. When checking out, you\u2019ll have the option to save any delivery instructions to that address.\n\nWhy does it tell me that a restaurant doesn\u2019t deliver to me?\n\nOur restaurants determine their own delivery ranges, so it\u2019s possible \u2013 if you\u2019re browsing by neighborhood, city or landmark rather than a specific address \u2013 that a specific restaurant listed won\u2019t deliver to you. To be sure right from the start, we recommend you search using a specific address. If you\u2019re not 100% sure of the address, it\u2019s best to be as specific as you possibly can.\n\nWhere did these restaurant ratings and reviews come from?\n\nThey\u2019re from Grubhub users just like you. In fact, you can review any restaurant you\u2019ve ordered from on our website.\n\nHow do I share my opinion about a particular restaurant?\n\nAny time you see a restaurant\u2019s rating displayed, you can click that section to add your own two cents. If you need real-time support, reach us on our Contact Us Page.\n\nHow does ordering for pickup work?\n\nIt\u2019s exactly the same as ordering for delivery, minus the \u201cdelivery\u201d part. Instead, the restaurant will let you know when to expect the food to be ready, and you\u2019ll shuffle over to grab it and go.Oh, and please remember to have an ID handy when picking your food up. Restaurants like to make sure that their food is heading off with the proper person.\n\nHow does Grubhub make ordering delivery more eco-friendly?\n\nWe offer the option to decline things like napkins, plastic-ware and other unnecessary items during checkout. Hey, it\u2019s a start.\n\nWhat about those plastic Grubhub bags?\n\nAny bags we give to our restaurants for packaging purposes are \u201cgreener\u201d than your average bag. As in, they\u2019re 100% biodegradable. That said, please recycle them if possible in your area. We\u2019re over that whole \u201cbag in the wind\u201d scene from American Beauty, and we hope you are, too.\n\nWhat browsers does Grubhub suppor... (truncated)",

Thanks in advance.\n\n\nYes, in most instances you can use butter or margarine in place of vegetable shortening. However, be aware that butter and margarine both contain a small amount of liquid and shortening does not, which adds some moisture to the recipe, but in most cases not enough to make a noticeable difference. For example, when adding a small amount of fat to thin out chocolate for use as a coating, it is best to use the vegetable shortening so that water is not introduced into the chocolate that could cause it to not firm up properly, or worse, seize up.\n\nButter (and margarine) are equivalent in measurement to vegetable shortening. For instance, 3\/4 cup shortening = 3\/4 cup butter (which is 1 1\/2 sticks of butter).\n\nHave a question? Submit it here.\n\nFAQ Archive Index",

        "text":"Q. What is the Tetrapak technology and how does it help keep food fresh?\n\nA. Tetrapak uses a special packaging technology that seals the food to eliminate bacteria growth. The food remains fresh without added preservatives till the packet is opened and comes in contact with the atmosphere.\n\nQ. Do we get the same nutrition from packaged foods as from fresh foods?\n\nA. Packaged food from Dansa Foods retain their original nutritional value because of the superior quality of processing. Foods like \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. also come reinforced with essential nutrients like minerals and vitamins to add extra nourishment.\n\nQ. How does Dansa Foods ensure hygiene in its food products?\n\nA. Dansa Foods has state-of-the-art food processing plants that are completely mechanized and sterilized. They eliminate manual contact to maintain hygiene and retain the natural goodness of the foods.\n\nQ. How should I store food from Tetrapaks after opening the packet?\n\nA. Once opened, the contents from a Tetrapak should be refrigerated. The life varies from one product to the other. See the instructions on the packaging to make sure you do not keep the food beyond its prescribed life.\n\nQ. How do I maintain a balanced diet?\n\nA. To maintain a balanced diet, make sure you eat a good variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, fiber, carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Grains, vegetables and fruits provide the largest amount of carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals that are essential for good health and to fight disease.
