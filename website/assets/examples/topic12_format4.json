        "text":"Anyone else with Meniere's Disease on top of fm\/cfs?\n\nDiscussion in 'Fibromyalgia Main Forum' started by emttoni, Aug 27, 2003.\n\n  1. emttoni\n\n    emttoni New Member\n\n    This dizziness has got to go! Had this about 3 years ago and now it is back with a vengeance. No one ever told me that you dont get rid of this tho. Just found that out on the puter. Also found out that the \"fullness\" in my ear is from this too. Been complaining to dr for 2 years that it felt like I had water in my ear all the time. They checked and checked and no fluid in ear. Guess I will be back in their office this week for anti dizzy meds. What is one more pill to the handful I take already? Gentle hugs to all ~ Toni\n  2. Cactuslil\n\n    Cactuslil New Member\n\n    Hi there. I have Meniere's and in retrospect I know that was also a part of why I was falling down every whip-stitch when I first got this stuff. And yes, I am always having vertigo.\n\n    Before the \"chair\" I used a cane. When without the cane I would pinch the side of my clothing to keep oriented. My mother had Meniere's and it progressed to where she had to have neurosurgery to sever a nerve on one side. She has taken Klonapin for years for the dizziness. Lil'\n  3. FM58\n\n    FM58 New Member\n\n    I had meneires (dx by ENT) before I was dx w\/ fibro. Several months later, I was having some episodes of fainting and my PCP wanted me to stop taking the meds for meneires - was so afraid all those horrid symptoms would come back again! She finally convinced me fo \"wean\" off, I was OK. Just occassional dizzy spells now.\n\n    However, I am sure that my fibro was going on for many years before it was diagnosed, so the menieres was during the fibro. I dread the day for it to strike again.\n\n    Good luck coming to the root of your dizziness! Hope you feel better soon!\n\n  4. simple\n\n    simple New Member\n\n    I was diagnosed with an inn-ear infection before I got diagnosed with CFS. I did not have full blown Meniere's Disease but the inner-ear infection did cause havoc with my balance for several months. After I was able to get the vertigo in check, by going to physical therapy, terrible fatigue began to show its ugly face. I eventually got that diagnosed as CFS. Now... the question I've yet to get an answer for is... was CFS there before my inner-ear infection... or did the inner-ear thing cause CFS. No one knows. Plus, I had root-canal problems that began two weeks prior to inner-ear infection... so it complicates things a bit.\n  5. libra55\n\n    libra55 New Member\n\n    I have vertigo from time to time but I have never been diagnosed with full-blown Meniere's disease. The vertigo is thought to be a component of the fibro syndrome.\n\n    Good wishes,\n  6. Seagull\n\n    Seagull New Member\n\n    along with FMS and CMP and bilateral CTS. FMS can co-exist with many other health problems. I was fortunate to finally find a couple of pcps who understood the differences in symptoms among all these conditions (after 8 years of going from doctor to doctor!) and referred me to the proper specialists for confirmation of the diagnoses. A rheumy diagnosed my CMP and FMS, an ortho diagnosed me with the bilateral CTS, and, eventually, a neuro diagnosed me with the Meniere's.\n\n    While it is true that viruses can be the cause of a lot of these problems, including Meniere's, there can be other possible causes, too. For me, the doctors felt it was the severe conconssion, whiplash, and upper spinal injuries received in a car crash that brought on my conditions. I know how frustrating all the testing and guessing can be -- and I mean from the doctors!\n\n    The ENT I was first sent to by my former pcp ran all the usual tests -- MRI (w\/dye contrast), the test where they force you into vertigo (I think it's called ENG?), hearing tests (I have it in the right ear). He thought it was BPPV, but he ignored the other symptoms I described of having constant loud tinnitus in my right ear, along with the nausea and violent vomitting. He also ignored how long I told him the attacks lasted, being for hours and sometimes days. BPPV symptoms do not usually have the tinnitus, nausea\/vomitting, and those attacks usually subside within a few minutes. He simply said I would have to live with it and to take 75 mgs of Dipyridamole 2x daily.\n\n    Interestingly, the symptoms did subside for the next 3 yrs. But, in December of last year, they returned with a vengence. So, I finally got a second opinion from my new pcp. Thankfully, he immediately recognized the difference in symptoms and diagnosed me with the Meniere's. To help control the intensity and frequency of the attacks, he put me on Diazepam (Valium) 2 mgs, up to 3x a day, Lasix 40 mgs, 1x a day, Dipyridamole 75 mgs, 1x a day. He also put me on a low salt\/sodium diet. Now when I have the attacks, they are usually very mild and the nausea is mild and vomitting often does not even occur. I am still exhausted for hours, afterwards and my muscles ache from head to tos.\n\n    I was referred to a neuro for further treatment options, and was seen by him. He did confirm the Meniere's diagnosis, saying that the ENT was incorrect in thinking it was BPPV. He also said that while there are many surgical and other types of treatment options, he did not think that I was a candidate for them at this time -- which I was glad to hear. He said that the treatment plan my pcp put me on is the first one he would have suggested trying, so I go for a follow-up in about 6 months to see the progress.\n\n    I am happy with the reduction in symptoms, so far, and hope to never need any invasive procedures or stronger meds.\n\n    One of the boards I frequent is the Menieres dot org. You will find a lot of help and great suggestions on that board, as well as, a lot of helpful links to even more resources. There are several on there who use various meds with good results. I wish I knew more about them, but, my doctors felt the ones I am on are sufficient for now. Plus, I did not have any viruses that contributed to my conditions.\n\n    I hope all goes well for you and that you find an acceptable treatment plan that helps. :)\n\n  7. Kim\n\n    Kim New Member\n\n    My mother had Meniere's. I've had constant off balance and dizziness (not much true spinning) since October. Have neck injury from accident. I also have fullness and popping in ear. Had inner ear surgery in March because they thought I had a hole in my inner ear but I didn't. I don't know if this is the beginning of Meniere's but I can tell you dizziness is the worst symptom I've ever had....and I've had lots of them. Valium helps a bit. Stress makes it much worse. All the meds I take don't help but I have to take them.\n  8. emttoni\n\n    emttoni New Member\n\n    Went into the clinic and could get right in! Will wonders never cease?!? lol\n    I heard when the nurse was telling the dr that I needed to be seen for Menier's and he said he didnt even know I had that. When I went in to see him I told him I thought it had gone away from the first attack but that I had found out on the puter that it doesnt go away. He said unfortunately its there to stay.\n    He put me on Meclizine 4 x's a day. That worked last time so hopefully it will this time too.\n    Gentle hugs ~ Toni",

        "text":"Tuesday, February 10, 2009\n\nHi everyone! I thought I'd post an update. Aidan is doing really well. Last Thursday he was in a really good mood all day long. He was smiling and cooing and \"talking\". He even rolled some from his back to his side when I went to give him his midnight meds. He's been moving his arms more and this morning when he did his usual stretch he raised his arms over his head instead of just stretching straight out.\n\nWe got a call from his neurologist Saturday afternoon, and we're going to start trying Ambien. We took him a few studies that talked about Ambien being used in patients with brain injuries. The drug is used to help people sleep, but in patients with brain injuries, it can actually \"wake up\" areas of the brain. People have reported more movement and talking in patients who normally didn't move or talk. We're starting out at a very small dose (1\/4th a regular adult dose). We'll see how he does, but I'm hoping for some good results.\n\nWe have an MRI scheduled on the 1 year anniversary of his accident. He's also got a SPECT scan scheduled... I'm not sure if it's supposed to be the same day or a different day since he has to be put under anesthesia for imaging.\n\nI can't believe it's been almost a year. Aidan has made a lot of progress and he has changed so much! He's grown a lot. I look at his pictures from last spring and he still looked so much like a baby to me. Now he looks like a big boy.\n\nWe got a new wheelchair today. I got a few pictures of Aidan in it. It fits him and his needs so much better than the other chair he had.\n\nI've included a few pictures of Evan and one of the progress on the afghan. I'm almost done with it. I have to sew the squares together and do the border on it. My goal was to have it finished in time for Valentine's day. I'm still hoping to have it finished then. I'll probably list it on eBay as an auction and post the link to it here so those interested can bid on it. I think that's probably the easiest way. I didn't really think the whole thing through.\n\nI hope you enjoy the pictures. I'll post more updates soon. :)\n\n\nLeslie said...\n\nWOW! That's AMAZING progress!!! We're praying the progress gets even faster for all of your sakes, but he is AMAZING! What a little TOUGH GUY!!! And your afghan is beautiful, I think ebay is a great idea. Post the link here, and you'll certainly have bids! The photos are excellent, thank you so much for taking the time to do these things (updates, photos) - I'm sure you're exhausted most of the time, but we all appreciate it SO much.\n\nWhitneyBooze said...\n\nErin -\nI was wondering if you could PLEASE email me, and let me know your phone number. I would like to call you! I am TOTALLY intrigued by the Ambien. After reading you post yesterday, I spent some time searching the internet for other info. I saw some good reports abouto the ambien being used with brain injury. I would like to know what dose they are going to give Aidan. Are you using 1\/4 of a 10 mlg tablet, or of a 6.5 mg tablet? I really want to try it with Suzy. I have some Ambien. Suzy is not in a semi-vegatiative state (which it appeared that the cases I read were in). She is still VERY LOW cognitive function, though. I guess a lot like Aidan.?\nHow often are you going to give it to him, and for how many days are you going to try it?\nI would LOVE to see Suzy move some more, or even start some VERBALIZATION!!! That would be HUGE!!\nAnyway, if you could please write me back, or let me know your number and I could call you, or you could just tell me the answers in an email.\nMy email - boozes@cox.net\nMy number - 757-471-9434\nMy website - www.suzybooze.com\n\nThank you.\nWhitney Booze\n\nWhitneyBooze said...\n\nHi Erin,\nI was wondering if you had a chance to see my post.?\nI'm not sure how often you check in, but maybe you have an email that I could write to you?\nI was going to start giving Suzy an ambien today (sunday), but I was waiting to hear from you.\nI guess i just wanted to know if the dose was 1\/4 of a 10 mg tablet?\nAnd I wanted to know when your neurologist thought you should try it, and what time of the day?\nThank you so much for taking the time to answer.",

I was very upset and worried as you know. She saw GP this morning. He said he suspects it is a vitamin deficiency. He has prescribed antibiotic cream and a product to replace her usual Johnsons baby bath. He said more red meat in her diet. He will assess her again in a couple of months. He said the tests on a small child for vitamin deficiency are a bit traumatic, so won't go that route unless she does not improve or the sores and hair loss get worse.\n\nMy son also discovered that the HV 'was' alerted by the NHS after the Calpol incident and a HV 'did' visit!

        "text":"Sunday, October 25, 2009\n\nA Bright Sunny Day.\n\n\nThe clock went back last night, so we are now living in winter time, not my favourite time.\n\nNot much that I can do about it so this year I will not bore everyone plus myself with going on about how much I hate winter daylight saving time.\n\nIn the past I would not change the time on my watch preferring to work out each time what the time really was.\n\nPerhaps finally I am coming to terms with the idea that things that I can not change will not get my attention.\n\nCould be good for me if I have learned this, as I do use up valuable energy on things I can do nothing to change.\n\nThink that someone like Dorthe would have her card well marked these days, she was an example of a friend who one ends up tolerating because of a vague memory of friendship.\n\nWhen I first knew her my self confidence had taken a nose dive, this did leave me open to peoples abuse\n\nMy self esteem has taken quite a bashing from the MS but I have managed to get to grips with that and really have understood that MS does not define me.\n\nI am alright; I am still quite a woman even if my body won\u2019t cooperate these days, it is not easy to be so handicapped.\n\nAs soon as I wake up in the mornings I am confronted with my bodies inability to move and the first spasms happen and my arms clamp shut as I yawn, and again I am aware of the pain.\n\nI do my arm exercises, when I get my arm straightened out, which does seem to help, am sure that the exercises have helped me retain the use of my arms and hands.\n\nToday has been a bright and sunny day, nice to look out of the window on sunshine and birds hopping about on the bird feeder.\n\nHave to relearn to love this time of year again and I will once I am back outside and able to feel the wind and smell the outdoor scents.\n\nLooking forward to the prospect of being liberated from my bed and tasting the delights of the outside world once again.\n\n\nHave Myelin? said...\n\nI remember my daughter and I hated losing an hour in the fall. Going dark earlier never made sense to us. We too prefer the \"other time\".\n\nI didn't know it was time to change tho. Blah.\n\nHerrad said...\n\nHi Sherry,\nThanks for coming by, it is 7.30 and it is very dark.\nYour time does not change until next week I think.\nKeep warm.\n\nGareth said...\n\nWatcha H@R, Ahh yes the clocks going back -forward- nerver quite understood it But look at it this way from the 21st Dec the days get longer. Glad the Sun been shining there hope it Shines when we come to visit really looking forward to seeing you folks. Stay snuggly GX\n\nWebster said...\n\nOn the North West coast of the U.S., Where Tacoma is, it is getting dark at 6:15 PM. We push the clocks back an hour next weekend so it will be dark at 5:15, followed by another 7 1\/2 weeks of continued darkness until the Winter Solstice, When oh so very slowly it starts to brighten again. No, I love the Fall, Winter, not so much anymore. I used to when I could go out and build a snowman or even shovel the walk, but those days are gone. I have no decent balance left.\n\nStill I like looking out the window at the bird feeder, and keeping cozy with the fireplace stoked - which my hibby is taking his sweet time to sweep the chimney, etc. Hopefully that will happen on the next dry day - when ever that may be. Actually, it wasn't too bad today, but I had to go in for a treatment. Ah, patience. Isn't that our buzzword for living with MS?\n\nJen said...\n\nI tend to beat myself up because of what the MS has done to my (now gone) outside career. Always thought I'd be out there working and running around. I guess maybe what I'm learning is to find other, slower ways to feel productive. And to know that that's okay.\n\nI totally get that feeling about the self-esteem, though.\n\nI think it'll be amazing for you to get out in that crisp air, Herrad. I'm always rooting for ya!\n\n\n\nHerrad said...\n\nHi Gareth,\nLovely to see your comment.\nSomehow not so sad the clocks went back as I have been in the past years.\nKnow that it will not be long and the light will be back and then more sun.\nTwo months is not too long.\nAnd first the extra sunshine of your visit.\n\nHi Webster,\nLovely to see your comment, thanks for coming by.\nVery noticeable tonight that it was alot darker.\nStill as Gareth reminded me it is only two months and the days will slowly start to get longer again.\nI too used to enjoy the autumn and winter more when I could go for a walk or throw a snowball.\nPatience I never ever had any before how about you?\nAnd now it is practically our middle names.\n\nHi Jen,\nThanks for coming by, lovely to see your comment.\nMe too I thought I would still be at work and able to get out and about.\nIt has been difficult for me to rebuild my self esteem, guess it is the same for us all.\nWe all have to do so in order to be able to live at ease with ourselves,\n\nThanks dear friends for coming by, listening to Smokey Robinson on the Electric Proms on BBC 2 at the same time.\nHe is an amazing singer.\nHope you all have a good start to the week.\n\nLucy said...\n\nWe have daylight saving also and it drives me nuts. Ours will change next week. Herrad I think of you so often. You and Mort and some of Mort's friends. I can relate so well to the awful things that take over your body. I do remember it well, everything from the spasms and losing up plus he lost the and his strength and just folding. It Is really tough to deal with that loss and liker you he tried everything to get better I has my son for 42 years.\n\nRain said...\n\nHi Herrad! Our daylight savings starts next weekend on Halloween night. I don't mind this time of year actually, but then again, I'm used to winters up North and it's a nice change for me to have the 4 seasons! I'm noticing lately that the mornings are dark when I wake up! That's a little freaky!\nYou have only 4 days before you can sit in your wheelchair! Any plans to go outside this weekend?\n\nsteve said...\n\nA lady with horrible behavior handled well by a lady with great grace.\n\nHerrad said...\n\nHi Lucy,\nThanks for coming by and sharing your feelings about your son.\nDaylight saving drives most of us nuts, think it puts too many kids in danger going home in the dark.\n\nHi Rain,\nThanks for your visit and comment, I shall do my best to like this time of year again.\nOne thing I have not liked is I can't go and do Christmas shopping on my own anymore.\nSo can't surprise Richie these days.\nBack to the drawing board.\n\nHi Steve,\nThanks for coming by and for your supportive comment.\nSad story, shame after 12 years of knowing her,but could not tolerate her behavior, certainly not after she read the diaries.\nWhat a betrayal of trust.\n\nThanks for coming by all of you and leaving a comment. Hope today is a good day for you.",
