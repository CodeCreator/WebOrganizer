If you missed a chance to hear any of our distinguished speakers in person, please visit our website to find links to the videos online. We will update as new videos become available.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the hidden treasures of the Clements Library is our collection of historical American newspapers, spanning from colonial times to the end of the 19th century. Unlike the rest of the printed materials in the Book Division, these volumes are largely uncatalogued in Mirlyn. For now, the best way to search them is through the good old-fashioned card catalog, which lists them by title.\u00a0\n\nAmong our colonial American newspapers can be found many interesting traces of life in the colonies, from news articles to advertisements for goods and services. Some of the papers even contain early printings of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution, two important documents to be shared with the American public. \u00a0\n\nCherokee Phoenix\nCherokee Phoenix (1828).\n\nThe Clements holds a run of the Cherokee Phoenix, the first Native American newspaper, with articles printed in both Cherokee and English. It was published in New Echota, Georgia, from 1828 to 1834. Many of the issues are inscribed \"Miss Sarah Kimball, Concord, N.H.\" in the upper\nleft corner, offering a clue to a former owner, perhaps the subscriber who first collected the papers. The Library purchased the collection in 1997.\u00a0\n\nAmong our Civil War newspapers, a noteworthy curiosity is the small sampling of Confederate wallpaper newspapers. These unusual items were the result of a paper shortage in the Confederacy, which forced several Confederate papers to print on sheets of wallpaper instead. Perhaps the most famous of these is the Daily Citizen of Vicksburg, Miss., dated July 2, 1863. On July 4, when Vicksburg surrendered to Union forces, the publisher fled and Union soldiers found the type standing on the press. They added a note and printed a new edition, using the remaining stock of wallpaper. The note concludes, \"This is the last wall-paper edition, and is, excepting this note, from the types as we found them. It will be valuable hereafter as a curiosity.\" As the note predicted, original copies of this wallpaper issue became a valuable souvenir item, with as many as 30 later reproductions made. The Clements holds several of the original copies, as well as a number of the reproductions for comparison. \u00a0\n\n\nwallpaper newspaper1wallpaper newspaper2\nFront and back of a copy of the Daily Citizen of Vicksburg, Miss., printed on wallpaper.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Library holds several other Civil War-era newspapers, including the\u00a0Southern Illustrated News. This newspaper, published in Richmond, Virginia, ran from 1862 to 1864. It was the first pictorial news weekly of the Confederacy, similar in format to popular Northern illustrated newspapers such as Harper's and Frank Leslie's. Most illustrations were portraits of Southern generals rather than the vivid scenes of war printed in other papers.\u00a0\nThe Southern Illustrated News (1863).\u00a0\n\nThe newspaper collection at the Clements Library offers many rich possibilities for research into topics of early American history. Curator of Books Emiko Hastings would be pleased to answer queries by email if you have any questions about the library's newspaper holdings or would like to visit the collection.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Clements Library's outstanding collection of pre-1900 cartography is most often consulted by our readers for its depictions of geography, topography, and urban and military architecture.\u00a0 Many researchers use our maps in conjunction with the written and printed source material they have come to study at the Library.\u00a0 Many use our maps as illustrations for the books that result from their research. \u00a0The breadth and depth of the cartographic collection ensures that there is something for almost any line of research dealing with the Americas.\u00a0\n\n\nCartographic compositions have another element that can have applications for both research and illustration.\u00a0 Often overlooked, border illustrations and cartouches adorn many maps, particularly those of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\u00a0 Cartouches are decorative enclosures on maps containing title blocks, scale bars, publishing information, and dedications.\u00a0 Many are fine examples of the engraver's art.\u00a0 Indeed, some engravers specialized in cartouches and frequently signed their work.\u00a0 The beginning of the nineteenth century marked the end of the particularly decorative cartouche as maps became increasingly \"scientific\" and less ornate in appearance.\n\nThomas Hutchins's cartouche scene of an Indian encampment depicts hunting, cooking, and child-rearing.\u00a0 It was probably based on observations by Hutchinson himself.\nCartouches from the century prior to 1800 are most often allegorical, incorporating human figures, animals, or plants symbolic of the subject of the map-distinctive female figures for America or Britannia; an alligator for South Carolina or Jamaica; examples of crops such as corn or sugar cane.\u00a0 Others are more realistically illustrative of life in the time and place being depicted.\u00a0 The title cartouche of Guillaume de Lisle's 1703\u00a0Carte du Canada, for example, incorporates two scenes of missionaries ministering to the Indians and two representing fur trading and wilderness warfare.\u00a0 John Gerar William De Brahm's South Carolina and a Part of Georgia (London, 1757) encloses its title amidst a particularly realistic depiction of slaves processing and packing indigo, an important crop in both provinces.\u00a0 Thomas Hutchins's 1764 map of the Ohio Indian country includes a pair of cartouche scenes, one giving a look into an Indian encampment and the other showing a council between Colonel Henry Bouquet and the Indians.\nTurtle spearing is shown on Nicolos de Fer's 1723 map of St. Domingue (Haiti).\n\nSuch \"realistic\" scenes in map cartouches vary wildly from accurate, first-hand views to compositions of the engraver's imagination or interpretation of others' descriptions.\u00a0 Many contain useful visual information, however, revealing what European observers saw or expected to see.\u00a0 A considerable number of the more realistic cartouches have been identified and described in Mirlyn records for the maps.\u00a0 Searching the Clements Mirlyn setting for the subject heading \"cartouches\" will reveal a wealth of graphic information well beyond the subject of the map.\n\nThe title cartouche of John Wallis's map of the brand-new United States combines allegorical elements with realistic portraits of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, the two best-known Americans of the time.\u00a0 It also includes a fine, early rendering of the U.S. flag.\n\n\n\n\nThe Clements Library's Manuscripts Division reached another milestone in its efforts to create finding aids for the division's uncataloged collections.\u00a0 Over 2,000 finding aids are now available on the Library's EAD web site, thanks to a generous grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC).\n\n\nNHPRC-funded Project Archivist Megan Hixon is nearing the completion of her monumental task of writing and encoding over 1,600 finding aids, according to minimal processing techniques.\u00a0 Her descriptions will help bring researchers together with primary source materials on a wide variety of subjects, including gender studies, race and ethnicity, education, law, politics, social reform, military history, public policy, religion, health and medicine, travel, business and commerce, naval and maritime history, theater and the arts, handwriting and grammar, and other topics.\u00a0 Among the recently available NHPRC-funded finding aids are:\n\n\nFisher Ames Collection, in the E. L. Diedrich Collection, 1783-1805.\u00a0 Letters written by United States politician Fisher Ames. He discussed political topics such as the first United States Congress, Congressional disagreements, sectarianism in Congress, the United States presidential election of 1796, and multiple prominent politicians.\n\n\nJohn Hooker Manuscript, 1874-1875.\u00a0 A 42-page manuscript copy of a letter that John Hooker wrote to Mrs. J. T. Howard on August 26, 1874, with addendums written in January 1875 (20 pages).

        "text":"The Caucasus: Land of Diverse Cultures\n\nThe title chosen for this mini-exhibit reflects one exceptional aspect of the Caucasus\u2013the diversity of its peoples (more than 40 ethnic groups), languages (50+ languages from both small indigenous language families and from the wider Indo-European, Mongolic, Semitic and Turkic language families), religions (Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism), geography (mountains, glaciers, lowlands, seashore), history and culture. \u00a0The exhibit could just have easily been entitled \u201cSmall Nations and Great Powers\u201d, \u201cCrossroads and Conflict\u201d, \u201cShattering Empires\u201d, all titles of recent books on the Caucasus. It is a small region of great contrasts and from time immemorial, of geopolitical significance to those larger nations which surround it\u2014Russia to the north and Turkey and Iran to the south. For centuries the North Caucasus region, forming the borderland of European Russia, has represented the literal and symbolic frontier between Europe and Asia. But it is the South Caucasus region, comprised of the now independent countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia,that is the primary focus of this exhibit. The Caucasus has captured the imagination of travelers throughout the ages, as well as being of current strategic importance to the world\u2019s powers. As one can see from even the briefest of historical chronologies, these have been countries involved in almost continuous conflict, war, forced migrations, massacres, ethnic cleansing, invasion, conquest and re-conquest, with borders that have shifted in response to each cataclysmic event. Nevertheless, each country has been able to nourish its language, literature, folklore and art, preserving its sense of ethnic and national identity (to paraphrase a local proverb\u2013\u201cThere are more poets than mountains\u201d).\n\nGeorgievskii Street in the town of Artvin, on the border between Georgia and Turkey. Over the last 1,000 years it was ceded to and recovered by Georgia, Turkey and Russia numerous times; since 1921, it has been a part of Turkey. From the Library of Congress Prokudin-Gorskii Photograph Collection.\n\nAs a true crossroads, the Caucasus plays an integral role in the emerging field of borderland studies (see journals such as Eurasia Border Review, The Journal of Borderland Studies), as well as Silk Road Studies (see the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute\u2019s Silk Road Studies Program at Johns Hopkins). Likewise, in the last decade or so, the addition of the word Eurasian to many of our long-standing academic Slavic and East European organizations and institutions documents this new emphasis on the regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia; perhaps the most notable example of this is the official change in name of The American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies to The Association for Slavic, East European and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES).\n\nThis exhibit has been prepared to coincide with the University\u2019s Center for East European, Russian and Eurasian Studies (CEERES) 2012-2013 lecture series \u201cConnecting with the Caucasus\u201c, which has brought together scholars from a variety of fields (Linguistics, History, Politics, Anthropology and Sociology, Literature\/Music\/Art) to revisit the histories, analyze the contemporary situations, encouraging the creation of new knowledge with regard to this area of considerable humanistic, social scientific, and strategic significance. The speaker series will set the stage for a 2014 CEERES conference on the Caucasus\u2013a follow-up to its 2007 conference (The Caucasus: Directions and Disciplines).\n\nThe next lecture in the program will be:\n\nGeorgi Derluguian (NYU Abu Dhabi), speaking on \u201cGuns, Maize, and Foreign Trade: The Origins of Democratic Polis in the Eighteenth-Century Caucasus\u201d.

Kinnick, Jr. was a University of Iowa student in 1939. The war began in Europe the same fall season when Kinnick and the UI \u201cIron Men\u201d once again put Iowa on the nation\u2019s sports map with their football victories. By the end of November, the team stood at 6-1-1, and Kinnick had won most major football\u00a0awards in the country. Kinnick traveled to New York City, where on December 6, 1939 he accepted the Heisman Memorial Trophy Award at the Downtown Athletic Club.\n\nAlready before his acceptance speech, Kinnick had earned the high praise of sports writers\u00a0and journalists across the country, some of who had called him \u201cThe Cornbelt Comet.\u201d\u00a0Yet even as he was achieving unprecedented fame at such a young age, Kinnick was aware of the terrible conflict\u00a0unfolding in Europe, and the challenge it posed to Americans. In his brief acceptance speech, he devoted the last 3 sentences to taking a position on World War Two.\n\n\nKinnick Heisman acceptance speech\n\nNile Kinnick's Heisman Trophy acceptance speech, December 6, 1939, New York City Downtown Athletic Club.\n\n\nKinnick\u2019s thoughtful words show an appreciation of football as a physical tournament, peaceful conflict resolution through a contact sport. In preferring the Heisman to the famous French war decoration, he echoed an independent-minded version of U.S. isolationism, and an appreciation of the values of his American society.\n\nKinnick graduated from the University of Iowa in 1940 with a BA in Commerce, and turned down some NFL offers to go to law school. As the global conflict unfolded, Kinnick\u2019s view of U.S. involvement in the war also changed. In 1941 he enlisted in the Navy Air Corps Reserve. He was called to active duty just three days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor \u2013 on December 10, 1941. Nile Clarke Kinnick, Jr. died on June 2, 1943, after his plane developed mechanical difficulties and was ditched in the Gulf of Paria.\n\nThe Papers of Nile C. Kinnick, Jr. are one of the most treasured collections of The University of Iowa Special Collections. Please see the online description of their contents here:",

        "text":"Skip to Content\n\nThe Authors Forum Presents: \"Elephants and Kings: An Environmental History,\" A Conversation with Thomas Trautmann and Andrew Shryock\n\nThursday, January 28, 2016\n12:00 AM\nHarlan Hatcher Graduate Library - Gallery #100\n\nBook signing and sale courtesy of Nicola's Books.\n\nBecause of their enormous size, elephants have long been irresistible for kings as symbols of their eminence. In early civilizations\u2014such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Indus Civilization, and China\u2014kings used elephants for royal sacrifice, spectacular hunts, public display of live captives, or the conspicuous consumption of ivory\u2014all of them tending toward the elephant\u2019s extinction. The kings of India, however, as Thomas R. Trautmann shows in this study, found a use for elephants that actually helped preserve their habitat and numbers in the wild: war.\n\nTrautmann traces the history of the war elephant in India and the spread of the institution to the west\u2014where elephants took part in some of the greatest wars of antiquity\u2014and Southeast Asia (but not China, significantly), a history that spans 3,000 years and a considerable part of the globe, from Spain to Java. He shows that because elephants eat such massive quantities of food, it was uneconomic to raise them from birth. Rather, in a unique form of domestication, Indian kings captured wild adults and trained them, one by one, through millennia. Kings were thus compelled to protect wild elephants from hunters and elephant forests from being cut down. By taking a wide-angle view of human-elephant relations, Trautmann throws into relief the structure of India\u2019s environmental history and the reasons for the persistence of wild elephants in its forests.\n\nThomas R. Trautmann is professor emeritus of history and anthropology at the University of Michigan. He is the author of many books, including Dravidian Kinship, Lewis Henry Morgan and the Invention of Kinship, Aryans and British India, and India: Brief History of a Civilization.\n\nAndrew Shryock is a cultural anthropologist. He has done ethnographic fieldwork in Yemen, Jordan, and among Arab and Muslim communities in Detroit. The author of several books, including Islamophobia\/Islamophilia: Beyond the Politics of Enemy and Friend, he is Chair and Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of Anthropology at the University of Michigan.\n\nThe Author's Forum is a collaboration between the U-M Institute for the Humanities, University Library, & Ann Arbor Book Festival.\n\nAdditional support for this event provided by the departments of Anthropology, History, and the Center for South Asian Studies.",
