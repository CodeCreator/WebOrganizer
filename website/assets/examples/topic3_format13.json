Brown today.\n\nBrian Bradley Beers, 47, of Beers, Texas; Kevin Wayne Guess, 45, of Annona, Texas; James Wayne Johnson, 30, of Kemp, Texas; and Billy Carl Webb, Jr., 51, of Clarksville, Texas, were named in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury on Nov. 14, 2018. Beers, Guess, and Webb were arrested on Nov. 30, 2018, in Red River County. Johnson was taken into federal custody on Nov. 19, 2018.\n\nAccording to the indictment, in June and July of 2018, Beers, Guess, Webb, and Johnson conspired to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine. Additionally, the indictment alleges that during that time, Johnson possessed 50 grams or more of methamphetamine with intent to distribute and that Beers, Guess, and Webb used communication facilities in facilitating the conspiracy.\n\nIf convicted, Beers, Guess, Johnson, and Webb face a minimum of ten years and as much as life in federal prison.\nThis case is being investigated by the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Red River County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the Mt. Pleasant Police Department. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan R. Hornok.\n\n\nPost a comment\nEmail Address: (must be a valid address)\n(will not be published or shared)\nComments: (plain text only)\nPrinter Friendly Format\u00a0 Printer Friendly Format\u00a0 \u00a0 Send to a Friend\u00a0 Send to a Friend\u00a0 \u00a0 RSS Feed\u00a0 RSS Feed\n\u00a9 1999-2019\u00a0The Police News.

        "text":"Nursing Home Neglect Can Lead to Even a Healthy Resident\u2019s Death\n\nWhen a Maryland nursing home accepts a resident into their care, the nursing home assumes an affirmative duty to provide an acceptable level of care to the resident. This entails ensuring that all physical needs are met, including the administration of medication, allowing residents to use the restroom as often as needed, and ensuring that residents get the appropriate level of nutrition.\n\nLegal News GavelGiven the tasks involved, running a nursing home is not an easy business, and many nursing homes operate on thin margins. Thus, nursing home management often are in a position in which they are trying to staff the home with the fewest number of employees possible. While this saves money, it also can prevent residents from obtaining the care necessary to live in a safe and secure environment.\n\nWhen a nursing home fails to provide sufficient coverage to care for the needs of its residents, and a resident suffers harm as a result of this failure, that resident or their family may be able to obtain financial compensation for any injuries caused by the home\u2019s negligence. Of course, a Maryland nursing home neglect plaintiff must be able to establish each element of their claim by introducing admissible evidence. Often, this consists of direct evidence, such as video recordings or witness testimony. However, nursing home neglect cases can also proceed on circumstantial evidence of abuse or neglect. This would include otherwise unexplainable bruises or bedsores.\n\nSon Believes Nursing Home\u2019s Negligence Responsible for Mother\u2019s Death\n\nRecently, the son of a woman who died shortly after she was admitted into a nursing home filed a wrongful death case against the nursing home, claiming that the home\u2019s negligence resulted in his mother\u2019s death. According to a local news report, the elderly woman suffered from arthritis and was wheelchair-bound.\n\nThe man\u2019s complaint alleges that while at the facility, his mother contracted a urinary infection shortly after her admission into the facility. Not long after the diagnosis, the man\u2019s mother passed away. As it turns out, the very same nursing home was cited after a government probe into the level of care it was providing residents. The case has only recently been filed, and no resolution has been reached at this point.\n\nIs Your Loved One at Risk?\n\nIf you have a loved one in a Maryland nursing home, and you believe that they may be at risk due to being neglected or abused, you should consult with a dedicated personal injury attorney. The skilled personal injury lawyers at the law firm of Lebowitz & Mzhen Personal Injury Lawyers have extensive experience representing victims of nursing home abuse and neglect, as well as their family members.

The cost to each existing member is \u00a3250 plus VAT for an initial 2 hour case review. If, during the review, issues are identified that may have wider implications for the GMB membership as a whole or opportunities to establish precedents and case law are identified then GMB may consider further financial assistance. Otherwise, members are then responsible for their own costs after having received advice.\n\nThe procedure for accessing the legal assistance package is for members to contact me as below asap and you will be sent a questionnaire to complete and return. I will then forward the paperwork to Andrews Angel Solicitors who will contact you direct.\n\nRegarding Brulines issues, we have an information pack and questionnaire available on request to members and issues will be reviewed on a case by basis by our in-house legal team at National Office.\n\nI trust this information is useful.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nSue Boyd\n\n.(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address)",

According to a report in the New York Daily News, the driver of a late-model four-door silver sedan was southbound on Central Avenue in Bushwick when he struck the bicyclist who was eastbound on George Street. The driver failed to stop and render aid to the victim. The injured victim was then rushed to a local hospital where he remains in critical condition. Police are still attempting to locate the hit-and-run driver. The victim was apparently a construction worker, who was well known for the bicycles he built on the side.\n\nHit-and-Run Collisions\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) reports that one out of every 10 crashes (about 11 percent) reported to the police involves a hit-and-run driver. Also, most hit-and-run crashes result in catastrophic injuries or even fatalities. Between the years 1994 and 2003, 14,914 people were killed in hit-and-run collisions, the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety reported.\n\nNew York Hit-and-Run Law\n\nUnder New York Statute 600.2: \u201cAny person operating a motor vehicle who, knowing or having cause to know that personal injury has been caused to another person, due to an incident involving the motor vehicle operated by such person shall, before leaving the place where the said personal injury occurred, stop, exchange information and contact the authorities.\u201d\n\nCompensation for Hit-and-Run Victims\n\nInjured victims of hit-and-run accidents are often left struggling to pay their medical bills and other expenses associated with their losses. When the hit-and-run driver is not found, victims can seek compensation through the uninsured motorist clause of their auto insurance policies or through a quasi-state agency if there is no motor vehicle in the victim\u2019s household. This applies even to cases where the at-fault driver is uninsured or underinsured. In some incidents, bicyclists or pedestrians may be able to file a claim against the city or governmental agency, if a dangerous or defective roadway is found to have caused or contributed to their injuries.\n\nIf you or a loved one has been injured or if you have lost a loved one in a hit-and-run accident, the experienced New York personal injury attorneys at the Law Offices of Kenneth A. Wilhelm can help you better understand your legal rights and options. We obtained $2,000,000 for a 6-year-old girl who was injured by a hit-and-run driver. The case was originally dismissed by the judge, but we aggressively appealed the judge\u2019s decision and had it overturned. Our client received a $2,000,000 settlement when the case was retried.
