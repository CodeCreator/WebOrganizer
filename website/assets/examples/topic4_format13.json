        "text":"NCCAS is awarded National Endowment for the Arts grant\n\nJuly 3, 2013\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Acting Chairman Joan Shigekawa has announced that the State Education Agency Directors of Arts Education, on behalf of the National Coalition for Core Arts Standards (NCCAS), is one of 817 nonprofit organizations nationwide to receive an NEA Art Works grant. NCCAS has been awarded a $30,000 grant to support the convening of a national Artist Advisory Council at the August 1-5 meeting of the NCCAS writing teams and leadership.\n\nThe recommended NEA grants total $26.3 million and span thirteen artistic disciplines and fields. Applications were reviewed by panels of outside experts convened by NEA staff, and each project was judged on its artistic merit.\n\nActing Chairman Shigekawa said, \u201cThe National Endowment for the Arts is proud to support these exciting and diverse arts projects that will take place throughout the United States. Whether it is through a focus on education, engagement, or innovation, these projects all contribute to vibrant communities and memorable opportunities for the public to engage with the arts.\u201d\n\nNCCAS, a coalition of eight national arts and education organizations and media arts representatives, is writing the new, voluntary arts standards in dance, media arts, music, theatre, and visual arts scheduled for release in 2014. The theatre standards are being created by representatives from the Educational Theatre Association and the American Alliance for Theatre and Education. Artists representing each of the five arts disciplines will attend the August meeting, serving in an advisory capacity for the writing teams.\n\nEdTA Executive Director Julie Woffington called the NEA grant a strong affirmation of the new arts education standards\u2019 value. \u201cAs an NCCAS leadership organization, EdTA has worked hard to reach out to our members and others in the theatre education community to ensure there is buy-in to these new standards. Funding from a public granting agency like the Endowment validates their worth in a broader national arts and education context.\u201d\n\nWoffington also said she is proud that EdTA has secured a commitment from playwright Jim Leonard, Jr. to serve as theatre\u2019s representative on the project\u2019s Arts Advisory Council. \u201cLeonard is a well-respected playwright and screenwriter whose work is widely produced by schools throughout the country. We\u2019re grateful and thrilled that he has agreed to serve in this capacity.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s plays include Anatomy of Gray, The Diviners, And They Dance Real Slow in Jackson, and Crow and Weasel. He has been awarded three NEA Fellowships, a New York Villager Award, the Midland Writers Award, the Samuel French Best New Play Award, and the Dramatists Guild Award. He co-wrote the screenplay for Mira Nair\u2019s award-winning film My Own Country. Leonard has created and produced several television series including Close to Home (CBS), Skin (Fox), and Thieves (ABC); and he wrote and produced Dexter (Showtime) and The Closer (TNT). He is currently a writer-producer for Major Crimes (TNT). Leonard also serves on the boards of the New Harmony Project and Circle X Theatre.\n\nFor the most up-to-date information about the standards project, visit the NCCAS website.",

        "text":"School Options Made Easier for Students\u00a0\n\nDistrict empowers families to make informed choices\n\nSeptember 30, 2013\n\nCPS prides itself on offering students a variety of academic programs to meet their specific needs. To help families identify which schools might be a good fit for their children, and to help them more easily navigate the application process, the District has created a host of new tools to supplement its existing slate of resources.\n\n\nThe application process for the 2014-15 school year begins on October 1. This process encompasses elementary magnet and selective enrollment schools, as well as several high school options, including magnet, selective enrollment, international baccalaureate (IB), military academies and career and technical education programs.\n\n\n\u201cOur goal as a District is to empower families to make informed decisions about their children\u2019s unique academic needs and to help them easily navigate this process,\u201d said CPS CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett. \u201cI strongly encourage families to take advantage of our helpful resources as they begin to explore our high-quality school and academic program offerings.\u201d\n\n\nStudents applying to 9th-grade can now log on to to schedule their own selective enrollment exams and magnet school auditions. They can also use this system to arrange the information sessions that are required by STEM and IB schools and military academies. Students interested in selective enrollment high schools are encouraged to schedule their exams early, as it may help them make informed choices about where to apply.\n\n\n\u201cSelecting early test dates can be beneficial for families,\u201d said Katie Ellis, Executive Director of CPS\u2019 Office of Access & Enrollment. \u201cStudents who schedule test dates in November and December will receive their results prior to the application deadline, which will help them narrow down their options for next year.\u201d\n\n\nThis self-scheduling system is a departure from previous years when test dates were assigned to students at random. The new system will permit students to choose times and locations that work in their calendars, even allowing for the changing of appointments when necessary.\n\n\nIn order to access this system, students MUST have a previously assigned Personal Identification Number (PIN). These were assigned by CPS to all eighth graders in a letter that also listed the programs to which each student is eligible to apply for the 2014-15 school year. This list was based on final grades and standardized test scores from each student\u2019s seventh grade year. All eighth graders are also being provided with a physical copy of the CPS High School Guide, which provides detailed information about all high school options that are available within the District.\n\n\nTo view the Self-Schedule Information Video, which provides a step-by-step guide to accessing the new system, click\n\n\nOther Helpful Resources\n\n  \u2022 The Office of Access & Enrollment (OAE) Website \u2013 Visit for general information about CPS schools and programs. For specific information on the application process, as well as selection and notification guidelines, click on the tab marked Resources.\n  \u2022 Up-to-Date Tier Data \u2013 Families applying to selective enrollment or magnet schools may want to use their home address to determine their respective tiers. This information is available at\n  \u2022 Option Guides \u2013 The District offers families comprehensive information on the academic programs available throughout CPS. Both the Options for Knowledge elementary school guide and the searchable high school directory are available in English and Spanish, and can be accessed by visiting Print copies can be obtained at any school, or by visiting CPS Central Office at 125 S. Clark Street.\n\n\nFamilies with additional questions are encouraged to call the CPS Office of Access & Enrollment at (773) 553-2060.\n\n\nPage Last Modified on Monday, September 30, 2013",
