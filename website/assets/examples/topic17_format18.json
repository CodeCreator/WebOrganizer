Renewing the Organization\u2019s call on warring parties for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Sana\u2019a, he added: \u201cWe cannot overemphasize that there is no military solution to the Yemen conflict. [We] stand ready to facilitate a negotiated political settlement that is inclusive, fair and sustainable.\u201d Earlier today, Jamie McGoldrick, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, highlighted the severity of the crisis and called for an urgent humanitarian pause to allow civilians to seek assistance, aid workers to reach them, and for the wounded to be evacuated.",

Palin could really feel the ethics violation was much ado about nothing, but you can\u2019t just say with a straight face that the report cleared her of all unethical activity. It specifically didn\u2019t do this; it found she abused her power and violated the Ethics Act. It\u2019s possible you\u2019ll think that is not an enormous deal.

Gov. Palin is just not lying about the findings. And, neither is the \u201cpressuring Monegan to fireside Wooten\u201d allegation was not a \u201cseparate charge of misconduct\u201d (because it was specifically included within the Report, saying EVEN WHEN SHE PRESSURED MONEGAN, it was not the only real cause he was fired and, due to this fact, correct and lawful).",
