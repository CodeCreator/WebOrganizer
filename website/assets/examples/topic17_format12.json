Quentin Young and Claudia Fegan advocate for HB 311, Rep. Mary Flowers 'Health Care for All' Illinois Act'\n\nPaying For Universal Health Care - And Not Getting It\n\nOriginal Research from HCAI\n\nHB 311, the Health Care for All Illinois Act, could save nough to provide health care for all. Comprehensive, universal health care for all Illinoisans doesn't need to mean higher taxes and more spending.\n\nThis study from HCAI shows that nearly $18 billion of Illinois current health spending is diverted to useless administrative tasks inherent in a for-profit private insurance-based health system.\n\nIllinois can recover that $18 billion and use it to provide universal care - but only if we're willing to cut out the parasitic private insurance industry.\n\nRead the full study here\n\nHow Can We Afford Universal Health Care?\n\nWith a looming $2 billion deficit in the state budget, how in the world can Illinois afford a single payer universal health care system?\n\nThe answer - confirmed by the state's own independent financial consulting firm - is that the system pays for itself. By removing $17 billion in wasteful private insurance paperwork, Illinois' single payer system would provide comprehensive, universal coverage without raising Illinoisans health spending. In fact, for the majority of Illinois families and businesses, the single-payer program would be a tax cut.\n\nThis HCAI financing paper explains the program in detail.\n\nSingle Payer in Illinois\n\nFor more information on single-payer organizing in IL, check out the web site of the Illinois Single-Payer Coalition.\n\nClick here for upcoming single-payer events in Illinois.\n\nPNHP Illinois supports Occupy Wall Street and all Illinois Occupy movements.\n\nIn November 2011 the leadership of PNHP IL adopted the following statement of support for Occupy Wall Street and all Occupy movements in IL.\n\nClick here to read the statement\n\nIllinoisans already pay enough for comprehensive universal health insurance - we just don't get it. This is becasue private insurers and the administrative waste they generate consumes nearly a third of our health spending. Replacing insurance companies with a single public payer would save Illinois more than $17 billion per year, enough to cover everyone. Single payer bill HB 942 (\"The Illinois Universal Health Care Act,\" formerly \"The Health Care for All Illinois Act\") would do this.\n\nRead a Summary of the Single-Payer Plan\n\nAnswers to Frequently Asked Questions\n\nClick here to Learn More\n\nHB 311 'Health Care for All Illinois Act' co-sponsors Rep.

These fileds are facing a wide array of new challenges including the spread of radicalisation and terrorism, hybrid and asymmetric warfare, cyber security, and the impact of climate change on conflict and mass migration.\n\nWomen are normally excluded from the male-dominated political groups that make critical decisions during conflicts and in peace processes. However, women are increasingly taking leadership roles not only in securing defence, but in matters that strive to avoid war and to create peace.

        "text":"In Their Own Words\n\nRaz ParnafesOne of our former CITs, who is a Jewish Israeli, gave a speech in which she discussed an act as simple as walking down the street.\u00a0 An act complicated, however, by the fact that she walked with her Arab friend and by the fact that they were among Israeli soldiers. Raz, a young Jewish woman, sees these soldiers and feels protected.\u00a0 Yasmeen, one of her best friends, a young Arab woman, sees them and feels fear creeping up, feels uncomfortable and scared. In the same moment in which Raz and Yasmeen display their friendship, their differences are made very clear.\u00a0 Yet they make it work: through their mutual determination to understand the other, a once far-off perspective is now fathomable to each of the young women. In the video above, Yasmeen speaks of the changes she and her peers in Ultimate Peace have experienced.\u00a0 Prior to her time with Ultimate Peace, peace in the Middle East had always seemed unfathomable to her; however, her experience in Ultimate Peace has given her hope that change is possible. She knows that it is up to her generation to not only embrace but to facilitate change, and she and her peers take every opportunity to push for it.\n\nAli AwwadAli has been a member of Ultimate Peace since the beginning.\u00a0 He showed up to camp in 2010 as a young boy eager to learn a new sport, get some energy out, and as he\u2019s said many times and which we\u2019ll never let him forget, \u201cfor the girls.\u201d\u00a0 Now, in 2015, Ali has turned into a national team Ultimate player, and a strong advocate for cross cultural friendships and peace-building in the Middle East.\u00a0 In his journey to becoming the well-spoken young man we see in this video, he has met and become close with many others \u2013 those who identify as Arab-Israeli as he does, as well as those who identify as Israeli Jews or Palestinians.\u00a0 Through Ultimate Peace, he has formed relationships that rely on the common interests of sport, peace, or (of course) girls rather than culture and religion.\u00a0 As you\u2019ll see in this video, Ali recognizes that the conflict of the Middle East is more than fact: each individual on each side has a story, which cannot be invalidated. His wisdom and eloquence come from his recognition and understanding of these stories, and they are reflected in so many other young leaders of Ultimate Peace.\n\nYonatan Ben HaimThe transformation we have seen in Yonatan, better known by his nickname Yabi, reflects the ideals of Ultimate Peace: he has changed from a boy simply interested in summer camp to an eloquent, ambitious, independent young man with visions for a more peaceful future.\u00a0 Visions, I might add, that he knows how to accomplish.\u00a0 As he says in this video, when he first came to camp it was simply a camp, but now Ultimate Peace has become a part of his identity.\u00a0 Last year, the remarkable young man who had begun as a shy yet spirited player, single-handedly added the community of Herzliya to Ultimate Peace. He saw that more communities were needed and he acted.\u00a0 This kind of leadership is what we hope to see in the CIT program, and now a graduate, Yabi has shown nothing but growth, confidence, desire for improvement, and an undying commitment to the bettering of the organization and the region.\n\n\u201dYou know, I think UP is going to be known all around the world in the next few years for doing something that no one else is doing, because it really, really works.\u201d\n\u2013 Amir Barkan, Age 13",
