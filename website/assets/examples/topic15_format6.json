The electrolyzer\u00a0can respond to grid conditions within 30 seconds and is operated by partner E.ON's virtual power plant network. The installation is part of a larger project, Carbon2Chem, which captures the flue gas from a steel plant in Duisburg to synthesize methanol and ammonia. Clients should consider this a crucial strategy in building the economic case for sector coupling, as grid service revenues can comprise up to 33% of total revenues\u00a0for electrolyzers and tip the balance for power-to-chemicals.\n\nFor the original news article, click here .\n\nFurther Reading\n\nGreen Mountain Power launches frequency regulation pilot program\n\nNews Commentary | May 27, 2021\n\nThis initiative builds upon GMP's early efforts to use residential batteries for demand response, a strategy that favors its utility business while reducing the economical hurdle faced by owners of distributed storage units.
