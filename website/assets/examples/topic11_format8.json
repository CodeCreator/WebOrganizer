        "text":"Team Fortress Wiki:Policies\n\nFrom Team Fortress Wiki\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThis page documents accepted policies and guidelines in use on the Team Fortress Wiki.\n\nTerms of Use\n\nMain article: Team Fortress Wiki:Terms of Use\n\n\nUnreleased content\n\n\"Unreleased content\" here refers to content for which there is some expectation of pending Valve release, but has not been patched into the game and has not been made public in Community servers; examples being content Valve claims to be developing or content mentioned in an ongoing Update ARG. For Community Mod policy, see Mod notability.\n\n  \u2022 Generally, images or articles relating to expected but unreleased weapons, items, or other game content are not permitted until they are officially released. This is because until that point, what the content is, does, or looks like cannot be confirmed.\n  \u2022 The main purpose of this is to reduce unverified speculation or other ridiculous conjecture appearing as 'fact' on article pages.\n  \u2022 You are, however, free to start creating the article in your user space and have it moved back into the article space upon official release. Note: main space categories are generally not permitted on articles in user space.\n\nImages and media\n\nFor image licensing policy, see Team Fortress Wiki:Licensing images.\nFor guidelines on image quality, see Team Fortress Wiki:Images.\nFor placing images in articles, see Help:Images.\n\nLanguages and localization\n\nSee Help:Language translation for help and specific guidelines related to article translation.\n\nThe content on Team Fortress Wiki is multilingual, and every effort should be made to ensure that readers of other languages can access the same content in their own native language.\n\n  \u2022 Articles should have multiple language translations. Content related to the organisation of the project (i.e. pages in the Team Fortress Wiki and Help namespaces) should normally not be translated.\n  \u2022 Many articles are kept translated via translation switching templates. This allows consistent formatting across pages, and ensures that localized text and template code are kept in one single template.\n\nCommunity websites\n\nThe community website pages on this wiki have always been prone to abuse, and as time went on, concerns of bias and the usage of the wiki as a vehicle for product advertising became more pronounced. A lack of guidelines acceptable to all parties has also always been an issue, so as of 2014-05-12 the wiki is enacting a concrete policy of no site pages whatsoever in favor of more helpful and informative basic guides that document the features more generally. This should solve the concerns of advertising and bias, as well as giving a more concrete starting point for newcomers. The new guides are: Basic Market guide, Basic trading guide, and Basic inventory guide.\n\nMod notability\n\nBecause the Team Fortress Wiki is treated as a reliable source of information by players, all new page additions are reviewed by staff to ensure that they meet minimum quality standards. In the case of community content, certain notability requirements also have to be met, in order to maintain this standard of quality. Before creating a new page for a community mod, please ensure that it meets these requirements, and be prepared to show them to staff should the need arise (either via IRC prior to creating the page, or on the talk page for the mod after it has been created). Beware that if a mod is not deemed as notable, it may be summarily removed.\n\n  \u2022 Running on multiple servers: The mod in question must be shown to be in use on multiple servers, run by different entities (meaning that if there are a half-dozen servers being run by one group or person, it doesn't count). These servers also have to show a reasonable amount of player activity, and not simply be empty all the time. If a mod truly is notable in the community, then players will request that server admins run the mod and\/or plugin, and it will see reasonable activity in those servers.\n  \u2022 Discussion among the community: Discussion of the mod must extend beyond the thread announcing its creation and development. It must be shown that the mod is actively discussed by multiple users over multiple communities, in order to illustrate its popularity among players.\n  \u2022 Exposure via YouTube: A very good marker of popularity is if a prominent YouTuber uploads a video of gameplay of the mod, or a popular Twitch streamer plays it (with or without fans\/subscribers is acceptable). Simply showcasing the mod over the course of a few videos and a few personalities is proof enough of trending popularity, it does not have to be multiple videos over a consistent time period.\n\n\nFor basic help with wiki editing, see Help:Editing\nFor tips on style, see Help:Style guide\nFor a complete list of help pages, see Help:Contents\n\n\nUser content\n\n  \u2022 Images\n    Some images are permitted to be uploaded for personal use on user pages. However, users who abuse the right to upload decorative images may have them removed.\n    User images should follow these rules:\n    \u2022 They should have the user's name in the file name (e.g. File:User MyName Steam avatar.png)\n    \u2022 They should be placed in the category User images (place the code [[Category:User images]] into the upload box)\n    \u2022 User images should not be used in articles, or share categories with article images.\n  \u2022 Signatures\n    Custom signatures are allowed. However, we would prefer that more attention is paid to improving articles rather than your own signature. As with user images, misuse of signatures may result in you losing the right to have one.\n  \u2022 Pages\n    User pages should not be placed in any article category.\n\nElevated privileges\n\nSee Help:Group rights.\n\n\n\nSee also:\u00a0Wikipedia:Protection policy\n\nGenerally most pages are not protected to encourage new edits and additions to content. However, some pages and articles are deliberately locked against editing, mostly for the following reasons:\n\n  \u2022 If an edit war breaks out and involved parties refuse to stop;\n  \u2022 If the page is high-risk: this can include templates like {{lang}} that are transcluded heavily, or pages that are heavily trafficked like Main Page.\n    If a template needs protection and translation switching, consider making use of the Dictionary to allow translators to update strings.\n\n\n  \u2022 Users are only blocked from editing if they prove to be consistently disruptive to the wiki. Vandalism, ignoring your talk page, or spam are all good ways to get blocked.",
