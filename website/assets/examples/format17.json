        "text":"I want to implement a nomination process. Users should be able to\n\n  1. Nominate existing Nodes of type 'course'.\n  2. Nominate new content that should later be of type 'course'.\n\nAll nominations should be listed somewhere.\n\nWhat's the best way to do this?\n\nFor 1. I thought about using the Flag module and then just make a view where all nodes with nomination flag are listed.\n\nFor 2. I'm not sure, maybe I use webforms and the admin has to transfer it into a node of type 'course'. But how do I get a list of new AND existing nominated content?\n\n\nHow about using modules Node_convert, and Flag (which is obviously a must have for what you're looking for)? About Node convert (from it's project page):\n\nadds a menu tab \"Convert\" on the node view page, i.e. node\/1\/convert, which gives the ability to convert the node from its current node type to another node type. The module provides the means to transfer all the field values of the current node type into fields on the destination node type, or discard them.\n\nI'm using Node_convert already for long time, works great. It allows for implementing a lifecycle (or workflow?) to start from a node that is only just something like an idea (or suggestion, question, issue, abstract, etc). Those ideas that get the highest votings, are the ones that seem to make sense to handle with highest priority. Compare it to a 'Question' with a lot of votes, but with hardly any (or no) answers.\n\nWhen the node's content evolves (read: the more effort\/details added to it), I convert its content type to finished products like (eg) a recipe, a redbook (already from my Drupal 6 days a few years ago).\n\nBy combining it with some type of access module (related to either taxonomy or content type) I can make it more restrictive to give access to it. E.g. public to start from, then \"authenticated\", and in the end only for roles such as \"subscribers\", \"students\", etc.\n\nMaybe you also want to consider Fivestar and\/or Voting API (I have the impression that \"Voting\" is a kind of synomym of what you mean with \"Nominate\").\n\nAnd of course: use Views as you are considering already. To continue my samples above: using some basics Views reports, you can easily massage it all in a todo list also.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n  \u2022 thanks for your input, sadly node_convert does not support all of the field types I need (e.g. paragraphs) but I keep this one in mind for another project. \u2013\u00a0scar May 18 '15 at 14:45\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

        "text":"Can testosterone jump-start female libido?\n\nThe People's Pharmacy\n\nPosted: Tuesday, July 31, 2001\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Q. I'm 43, and over the past few years I have noticed that my libido has really dropped off. I used to enjoy and even initiate making love, but now I'm just not interested most of the time. I thought this problem might be due to the Prozac I was taking, but my doctor switched me to Celexa, and I haven't noticed any improvement. Would testosterone be of any help? I've heard that it can \"jump-start\" libido in women, but I don't know where to find it. Is it available in ointments, gels, creams or lozenges? And what side effects might it have? I'd appreciate any information you can send.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A. Antidepressants such as Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil are notorious for interfering with sexual fulfillment. The maker of Celexa (citalopram) admits, \"There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with citalopram treatment.\" Nevertheless, lowered libido and inability to achieve orgasm have been reported in women taking this drug. Testosterone has been shown to increase libido in women as well as men. Gels, creams and lozenges are available from compounding pharmacies, but the Food and Drug Administration has not approved their use by women. Side effects such as acne, deepened voice, enlarged clitoris, weight gain, increased cholesterol and facial hair are possible if doses are too high or the hormone is taken for too long.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are sending you our Guides to Female Sexuality, Treating Sexual Dysfunction and Antidepressant Pros and Cons for more details on testosterone and other approaches. Anyone who would like copies, please send $3 in check or money order with a long (No. 10), stamped (57 cents), self-addressed envelope to: Graedons' People's Pharmacy, No. PZX, P.O. Box 52027, Durham, NC 27717-2027. Wellbutrin (bupropion) is an antidepressant that might offer an alternative to Prozac or Celexa. Instead of dampening desire, this drug actually appears to enhance libido.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Q. Is there any over-the-counter product that can help get rid of ear-wax buildup?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A. A solution of 6.5 percent carbamide peroxide with glycerin is sold under several brand names, such as Auro Ear Drops, Debrox or E-R-O Ear.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Q. My husband has had tinnitus for years. He has a constant buzz in his ears and also hears a sound he likens to a dishwasher running. The doctor says other people have this problem and doesn't think it is serious. This particular sound occurs mostly when he goes to bed or wakes during the night. If he is at work or at lunch it rarely bothers him. My husband does very little exercise and is the most stressed-out person I know. He's terrified of any symptom that could signal a terminal illness. He is focused on this ear noise, and it really has him on the ropes. Can you reassure him?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A. A thorough tinnitus work-up would rule out any serious condition such as high blood pressure, hypothyroidism or an acoustic nerve problem. If tests come back negative, he can focus on ways to cope with this terribly annoying but not life-threatening problem. Tinnitus can be caused by many things, including drugs (too much aspirin or other over-the-counter pain relievers) and prolonged exposure to loud noises (gunshots, explosions). At bedtime, a white-noise generator or a radio playing softly might mask the sound he hears.\n\n\nThis article published in the Athens Banner-Herald on Tuesday, July 31, 2001.\n\nTrending this week:\n\n\nAthens, GA ?
