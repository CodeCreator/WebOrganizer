        "text":"\n\nHe Said - She Said Christian Dating Advice\n\nIs it Inappropriate to Date My Youth Pastor?\n\n  \u2022 Cliff Young & Laura MacCorkle Contributing Writer & Senior Editor\n  \u2022 2012 10 May\nIs it Inappropriate to Date My Youth Pastor?\n\nEDITOR'S NOTEHe Said-She Said\u00a0is a biweekly advice column for singles featuring a question from a reader with responses from a male and female point of view. If you've got a question about anything related to singleness or living the single life, please submit it to He Said-She Said\u00a0(selected questions will be posted anonymously).\n\nQUESTION: I'm seventeen (eighteen in a month) and about to graduate high school. I just started going to my church's youth group a year ago and am basically the oldest kid there. A couple of months ago, I started to really like my youth pastor. I don't think that is that surprising, because he's an older guy and probably the most godly man I know. But here's the thing: I think he might like me, too. He is only a couple of years older than me, so honestly, if he wasn't my youth pastor, it wouldn't be that weird. Would it be inappropriate if after I graduate high school and leave the group we were to pursue a relationship?\n\nHE SAID: I appreciate you seeking counsel as you may sense the seriousness of the ramifications of the relationship you desire.\n\nAs a \u201cperennial\u201d high school youth leader, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t share some of the astute guidance I received under the tutelage of some very wise pastors and mentors. Please receive this word of caution out of concern not condemnation.\n\nBefore you venture down this road too quickly (even in your mind), please respect the ministry your youth pastor has been called to and the role he plays within the church. What may seem like an innocent attraction at this point, can jeopardize and derail what God has planned for him and the lives of those surrounding the both of you.\u00a0\n\nSEE ALSO: Answering the \"Do You Have a Family?\" Question\n\nAs a youth pastor, he is accountable to his youth and pastoral staff, all of your parents and the congregation, and to God. He is being held to a much higher standard than another young man who is only a couple of years older. He is called to live a life above reproach with no \u201cappearance of immorality.\u201d\n\nBecause of his position and your age, any contact between the two of you outside of sanctioned youth and church activities (or in private) may be construed as improper conduct.\n\nI caution you about sharing your feelings with anyone except for a much older, mature, female confidant who is well acquainted with each of you. Discussing it, even with a friend you \u201ctrust,\u201d may lead to envy, jealousy, gossip, hearsay or rumors, all of which will be detrimental to his ministry and the group.\n\nI strongly suggest you don\u2019t proceed, encourage, manipulate or promote a relationship or contact with your youth pastor beyond the bounds of \u201cofficial\u201d youth group activities. If a relationship with your youth pastor is truly called by God, it will wait a couple of months (or years), as in the case of those I have worked under in youth ministry.\n\nSEE ALSO: Should Parents Encourage Adult Children to Date?\n\nOnce you turn eighteen, graduate and are no longer a part of his ministry, if there is mutual interest he should be the one to take the initiative to pursue a relationship with you. What often gets us into trouble is following the tug of our heart rather than prayerfully seeking an answer and waiting for God\u2019s timing.\n\nSHE SAID: Inappropriate? No. It would not be inappropriate to date someone a couple of years older than you, since you are both (or you soon will be) of legal age. But in this case, could it appear to be inappropriate? Yes.\n\nI think what gives me the most reason for pause in your situation is this: your younger brothers and sisters in Christ in your church youth group. What will they think if they see a very recent former group member in a dating relationship with their current youth pastor? Will they continue to learn from his teaching uninterrupted and glean understanding from their Bible studies with him? Or will their focus be diverted to your relationship and will they start seeing the youth pastor in more of a predatory-possibly-creepy light (even though you are of legal age, I understand) instead of as a trusted mentor and shepherd?\n\nDo you see the point I\u2019m trying to make? Let\u2019s also see what Scripture has to say:\n\nSEE ALSO: How Should I Spend My Money?\n\nAvoid every kind of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22).That means if the \u201cappearance\u201d of what you are doing (even if it is on the up and up) would lead someone to think there is something \u201cevil\u201d going on and could be offensive to them, then you need to do your best to steer clear of it.\n\nDo not cause anyone to stumble (1 Corinthians 10:32). If your primary desire is to be someone who is adding\u00a0to the Kingdom and not detracting from it, being conscientious of your actions and how they can influence others will be a priority for you in your faith journey.\n\nAs believers in Christ, our primary mission here on earth is to represent our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and to spread the Good News about what he has done for us on the Cross (Matthew 28:16-20). I know you are young, but whether you know it or not you truly are more of an \u201celder\u201d in your youth group, and the younger members are looking to you as an example for holy living. That means you are charged with living above reproach.\n\nNow, if you start dating your youth pastor after you graduate high school and have exited the church youth group will that cause a \u201clittle one\u201d to sin (Mark 9:42)? Maybe and maybe not. But could it cause confusion and cause impressionable teens to doubt what they are hearing being taught from the Word by their youth pastor? Absolutely!\n\nSEE ALSO: If You're Not Involved in a Singles Ministry\n\nAnd so my advice to you is to do what might seem like a very drastic measure: do nothing and wait. You have your whole life ahead of you. I can\u2019t give you a timeframe, but I know that if you are prayerfully seeking God\u2019s will in this matter that he will show you when or\u00a0even if you are to act on your feelings for your youth pastor. In the meantime, \u201chave salt\u201d in yourself (Mark 9:50) as you seek to be a witness for the Lord and let your life point to him wherever you go and in whatever you do.\n\nHE is \u2026\u00a0Cliff Young, a\u00a0contributing writer\u00a0and a veteran single of many decades.\u00a0He has traveled the world in search of fresh experiences, serving opportunities, and the perfect woman (for him) and has found that his investments in God, career and youth ministry have paid off in priceless dividends.\n\nLaura MacCorkleSHE is \u2026\u00a0\nLaura MacCorkle, Senior Editor at\u00a0She loves God, her family and her friends.\u00a0Singleness has taught her patience, deepened her walk with the Lord and afforded her countless (who's counting anyway?) opportunities to whip up an amazing three-course meal for one.\u00a0\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0We are not trained psychologists or licensed professionals.\u00a0We're just average folk who\u00a0understand what it's like to live the solo life in the twenty-first century.\u00a0We believe that the Bible is our go-to\u00a0guide for answers to all of life's questions, and it's where we'll go for guidance when responding to your questions.\u00a0Also, it's\u00a0important to\u00a0note that we write our answers\u00a0separately (we think they sound eerily similar sometimes, too!).\u00a0\n\nGOT A QUESTION?\u00a0If you've got a question about anything related to singleness or living the single life,\u00a0please submit it to\u00a0He Said-She Said\u00a0(selected questions will be posted anonymously).\u00a0While we are unable to answer every inquiry, we do hope that\u00a0this column\u00a0will be an encouragement to you.

How do you make your own hair\n\n~ Holly\n\nA: Your very welcome, and...\n\nI developed my own recipes from researching into herbology and basic\n'homemade' body care product recipes. From looking at the results of the\nrecipes and tweaked it to my own standards.\n\n\nA basic shampoo recipe is:\n\n~1\/2 cup of organic castile soap\n~ 10 drops of essential oils (your choice)\n~ 1 cup of water.\n\nI looked at that recipe and realized that it wouldn't have enough base\nor body for my kind of hair. So I researched into different types of\nplants that would give my hair nutrients, body, and keep it\n\nA great research starting point is...\n\n\"Beauty By Nature\" by Brigitte Mars\n\nShe teaches you details about how your body works and techniques on how\nto care for it. She also analyzes different herbs that are good for herbalist beginners (like, general herbs that you can find in grocery stores, local herb shops, etc). And shares some basic recipes.\n\nThe best hair care products that you could ever use, are ones that you make yourself from your own sun-infusing kitchen. Everyone has their own expectations on what a hair or body care product should do.\n\nBut here is another basic recipe:\n\n* Hair food:\n3\/4 cup shea butter\n10 drops of your choice of essential oils\nadd a cup of herbs (of your choice) to infuse into the oil mix. (then drain them before placing mixture in a container.\n\n(Melt butter on the lowest heat, until butter is liquefied. Add in\nessential oil. Then place mix in a container, put in fridge to harden)\n\nAt this time, I am not going to post up my recipes that I have been developing. But if you ever have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\n** Another tip, is to keep your products vegan and chemical-free for better results.\n\nOn a slightly other note...\n\nIf you are in the Seattle Area, in September. There's a Natural Hair Meet Up Group getting together\non the 20th. I'll be there and I will be giving a\npresentation on things that I found out... if you want to come along, you can\nholla at me\n\nMy AOL name is:\nPinky White01\n\n\nand another good book is \" the herbal spa\" by Breedlove\n\nHope that I helped.\n\n\nNatural and Nappy\n\nNo comments:",

This new\ndatabase server will have a new name for SharePoint to reference. How do I go\nabout pointing SharePoint 2007 from the old database server name to the new\n\nIt seems like there should be a simple solution, but I have yet to find a solid\n\n\n\n7 Answers Found\n\nAnswer #1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: .net Guru \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nThe simplest solution would be if you had built your original system using\nan SQL alias. Then all you would need to do is move the physical databases\nand change which server the alias was pointing to. That's why its normally\na best practice to always use SQL aliases when doing a SharePoint install.\nSince it appears that you didn't use aliases, it's a little more difficult.\nMoving your content databases is fairly easy. You can just detach them,\nback them up, restore them to the new server and then re-attach them using\nthe new location. But you can't do that with the configuration database.\nTake a look at the following blog post for more info.\n\n\nAnswer #2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Renata Burt \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nUnfortunately when this farm was originally configured the db alias option was\noverlooked or not literally recommended at the time 3 years ago. I'm the one\nwho set up this farm originally, I reviewed MS documentation available at the\ntime and do not see a reference to using a db alias during installation. Oh\nwell, that is water under the bridge.\n\nI will review the link you sent. I also was referred to this link:\n\n\nIt's a newer procedure, but still does not give an example that is like my\nrequirement. I may have to create a hybrid solution.\n\nHopefully I can come up with a solution that includes a db alias.\n\nAnswer #3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Lazaro Rutledge \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nIt is a newer link, but you'll notice that step 11 requires creation of a\nSQL alias that uses the same name as the existing SQL server. This will\nonly work if you are deactivating the existing server when moving the\ndatabase. So you will be physically moving the databases, but all the\nnaming will remain exactly the same as it is now.\n\nAnswer #4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Karin Kerr \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nI noticed that as well. Since in this solution I will not be changing the db\nserver name configuration in SharePoint, I have other concerns.\n\nThe current database server configuration is \"ds1prodmoss\\moss,1437\". Will this\nformat convert to an alias name. My concern is whether I can use a '\\'\ncharacter in the alias name and also indicate the port number as part of the\nalias name? Does the alias point directly to the instance or does the instance\nget appended to the alias name? And the same with the port number. Will an\nalias name such as this be invalid?\n\nAnswer #5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Vinod Kumar \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nYou'll have to try it. I normally use an alias so that I don't have to\ninclude the instance name, since that can cause some issues in SharePoint\n2010. Whichever way you go I don't think you would use the port number as\npart of the alias.\n\nAnswer #6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Jeffery Hayes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nI've successfully aliased a named instance before. I've also been on a\nnon-standard port. Should work. Give it a try\n\nAnswer #7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Mohini Tiwari \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nI've successfully created an alias for a named SQL instance before too. In\nfact I consider that a Best Practice when working with SharePoint. But what\nI wasn't sure you could do was name an alias as though it were a named",

        "text":"My Crush Is Being Mean To Me \u2013 Does That Mean He Likes Me?\n\nHi Heather,\n\nI went on a few dates with this guy I really like and we\u2019ve hooked up a few times. But now I\u2019m scared that he might be using me just to hook up. He\u2019s also been trying to get with my best friend! Whenever we hang out, he won\u2019t stop talking to me about how she is better at me in swimming and how she is a runner and I just bench warm for the volleyball team. I know that people say that when a guy is mean to you, that means he likes you\u2026 well, is that true? He compliments me sometimes but he also says nicer things about my friend. I just don\u2019t know what to think. Help!\n\nTwo words: run away. Seriously. This guy sounds like a jerk and you deserve to be treated waaaayyy better than this.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised that you\u2019ve heard that when guys are mean to you, that means they like you. I think we were all told this when we were little kids \u2013 whenever a boy was picking on you at school and you complained about it to an adult, he\/she probably said something along those lines. Here\u2019s the thing, though: while this is sometimes true for very young, immature boys with a little crush, it\u2019s not true for older dudes who really do have feelings for you.\u00a0\n\nYes, your average teen boy full of hormones who doesn\u2019t know how to deal with feelings may tease you or bully you a little bit if he likes you. But he most likely wouldn\u2019t take it this far, especially if he\u2019s already hung out with you and hooked up with you. This isn\u2019t harmless and annoying teasing to try to get your attention \u2013 this is being genuinely mean, rude and insensitive and it\u2019s not cool.\n\nIt sounds like this guy is way too immature to handle any sort of relationship right now. He\u2019s into hooking up with you, but it doesn\u2019t seem like he wants anything more than that. It also sounds like he has a crush on your best friend and it\u2019s totally not okay for him to keep rubbing this in your face. If he likes your BFF, he never should have hooked up with you in the first place. Also, he shouldn\u2019t be telling you about it and he definitely shouldn\u2019t be comparing you two! That is NOT okay. He\u2019s acting like a jerk and not a jerk who just doesn\u2019t know how to tell you he likes you \u2013 he\u2019s a jerk who thinks he can treat you however he wants.\n\nSo, here\u2019s what I think you should do: stop talking to and hanging out with this guy ASAP. You don\u2019t deserve to be compared to your best friend by a dude who knows you have feelings for him. When a guy likes you, he\u2019s not going to purposely make you feel bad about yourself (unless he\u2019s 12-years-old). He\u2019s going to go out of his way to talk to you, hang out with you and make you feel good all the time. If a guy is into you, he\u2019s not going to tell you he thinks your best friend is hot. Plain and simple. Let this dude go and find someone who will give you the respect you deserve.\n\ntake care,\n\nWhat\u2019s on your mind? Heather can help! Send her your question at\n\n\nScared to have sex? Read this now!\n\nDon\u2019t forget to follow us on Twitter\n\nPosted in: Love Advice\nTags: , ,",

Hi Felicia, The gazebo porch is not part of the original design, but you can make this modification. We have several builders listed on our website that have built The Hollyhock. I don\u2019t see anyone located in North Carolina but there are a few in Tennessee and Virginia that may be close enough for you to travel, if interested.

Hi Julio, We have a lot more details and photos of The Birchwood on our website! This plan is not designed with a basement but you can order a basement foundation and modify it to be a walkout.

Unfortunately, we haven\u2019t added new plans to this category in years but we can modify any of our designs to incorporate wider doorways and walkways, well planned bathrooms, etc.\n\n      For retirement homes, those are typically smaller and simpler designs on one story.

Looking for a single dining room plan with a garage in the back of the house. ( I really like the Peyton, but want the garage in back of house and home around 2300 sq feet) Do you have anything like that? Thank you\u2026 and I love this blog\/website!\n\n  11. Hi,\n\n    Do you have any photos of the Arcadia yet? We want to build this soon but can\u2019t get a real feel for it from the design sketch. Thanks.\n\n  12. This may be a long shot but the gray exterior color on the Birchwood shown \u2013 do you happen to have that color listed ?\n\n    1. Hi Lisa, I\u2019m sorry but we are not involved in the building process and the customer that provided the photos did not give us a list of products and colors used. You may be able to show the photo to a local supplier and they can match the color.\n\n    1. Hi Jodi, The Harper has been purchased but we have not received any photos yet, nor have any builders volunteered their contact information. We are not involved in the building process so we depend on customers to send us photos and builders to add their contact information on our website after they build one of our designs.\n\n  13. Is a walkout basement possible with plan 1351 Simon? Where would the stair be located? I do not want to lose any features of the home, especially the closet space and the panty (which is a must have for me)\n\n    1. Hi Tonya, The Simon has not been designed with a basement floor plan yet, but a basement can be added to any of our designs. We can make them fully underground through our regular ordering process or you can modify the basement to be a walkout through our custom modifications. The designer will determine the best location for the staircase, it is common for us to move the garage forward a few feet without disruption any of the other features of the design.\n\n  14. I\u2019ve been combing through floor plans for months now, and I really like the Carmichael plan layout \u2013 it is about 90% what we really want and the right size too \u2013 BUT I do not like the facade at all! How complicated is it to put a facade similar to (for example) Redding\/Henderson\/Cassady with the Carmichael plan? Got to have those two closets in the master bedroom, and a good sized utility room space. Thanks.\n\n    1. Hello, we often get request from customers to change the exterior facade of a plan. A designer would need to look at your request to determine the difficulty of your request and what changes are possible. Complete our modification request form to start your consultation and get a quote.\n\n  15. Do you have any study sets with elevations for the Stonemason? Trying to lose some square footage from the plan. Maybe the bedroom and closet behind the kitchen. Trying to see what the roof line looks like. Thanks\n\n  16. We want to build your Cedar Court plan, but we prefer the\n    Master BR\/ study of the Hollow Crest. We also want the basement in the Cedar Court. How can we combine our preferences and get the home we want?\n\n  17. Do you have any interior pics of the meadow creek house plan? We are looking for something this size that\u2019s one story and has a 3 car garage with bonus room. We also like the birchwood and clarkson plans. Any other suggestions??\n\n\n  18. Looking for a plan with a side facing family\/great room and 3 car garage with entry on the opposite side. Large kitchen and master bath.\n\n  19. On your plans, the \u201cBonus Space\u201d stairs are included. What becomes of this square footage if you do not choose to construct the Bonus Space?\n\n  20. We are looking for a plan that will work on our lot that slopes uphill from the street and has forward facing ... (truncated)",
