AnswerParty!\n\nMore Info:\n\ngay Television\n\nWill & Grace is an American television sitcom, originally based on the relationship between William Truman and Grace Adler, and is set in New York City. It was broadcast on NBC from September 21, 1998 to May 18, 2006 for a total of eight seasons. Will & Grace was, during its original run, the most successful television series with gay principal characters. It still enjoys success in syndication.\n\nDespite initial criticism for its particular portrayal of homosexual characters, it went on to become a staple of NBC's Must See TV Thursday night lineup. It was ensconced in the Nielsen top 20 for half of its network run. The show was the highest-rated sitcom among adults 18\u201349, from 2001 and 2005. Throughout its eight-year run, Will & Grace earned 16 Emmy Awards and 83 nominations.\n\nSean Hayes Jack\n\n\"A Chorus Lie\" is the sixteenth episode of the American television series Will & Grace's fourth season. It was written by Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally and directed by series producer James Burrows. The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 7, 2002. Guest stars in \"A Chorus Lie\" include Matt Damon, Leslie Jordan, and Patrick Kerr.\n\nIn the episode, Jack (Sean Hayes) begins a rivalry with a fellow named Owen (Matt Damon). They are competing to be the final entrant in a gay men's chorus, and after learning that Owen is straight, Jack tries to \"in\" him with help from Grace (Debra Messing). Meanwhile, Karen (Megan Mullally) tries to pass off Will (Eric McCormack) as her lover and not her lawyer when she discovers that she is the object of pity for being single at her own Valentine's Day party.\n\n\nEntertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.\n\nThe experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.\n\nIn journalism, a human interest story is a feature story that discusses a person or people in an emotional way. It presents people and their problems, concerns, or achievements in a way that brings about interest, sympathy or motivation in the reader or viewer.\n\nHuman interest stories may be \"the story behind the story\" about an event, organization, or otherwise faceless historical happening, such as about the life of an individual soldier during wartime, an interview with a survivor of a natural disaster, a random act of kindness or profile of someone known for a career achievement.\n\nA social issue (also called a social problem or a social situation) is an issue that relates to society's perception of a person's personal lives. Different cultures have different perceptions and what may be \"normal\" behavior in one society may be a significant social issue in another society. Social issues are distinguished from economic issues. Some issues have both social and economic aspects, such as immigration. There are also issues that don't fall into either category, such as wars.\n\nThomas Paine, in Rights of Man and Common Sense, addresses man's duty to \"allow the same rights to others as we allow ourselves\". The failure to do so causes the birth of a social issue.\n\n\nRelated Websites:\n\nTerms of service | About",

However, for this sort of situation on a UNIX system, generally all you would have to do is restore the filesystem backup and boot ASE. On Windows, to restore registry entries, I'd guess that you might have to reinstall the ASE software. You can presumably download from SAP the same patch you were running on before this event and run the installer after restoring the file system and tell it to install in the same place. This would likely restore all the registry entries created by an initial install.\n\nTry that and see if you can at least get ASE booted, we can then try working out what needs to be done to resolve any finer-detailed issues.\n\n\n10 |10000 characters needed characters left characters exceeded\nTilman Model-Bosch\nMar 09 at 08:06 AM\n\nI think you can install a completely new SAP system using SAPINST.

I am from India and work in a college as a lecturer. Two weeks ago, two of my students who are of 16 years of age each, asked me a doubt in the subject which I teach them. In order to answer their question on the note book (book is already there on the table) I asked a pen from them and then one of the girl gave me her Pen taking straight from her mouth and I accidently put(kept) her Pen immediately in my mouth where I have bleeding wound. Before solving\/answering their question on the book I had to think for some time and during that time I kept her pen in my mouth where I have bleeding wound. The girl who gave her pen has a habit of always keeping her pen in mouth and biting. Do I get HIV through that Pen if she is HIV positive and her blood poured on the pen before she gave me. Really I am worrying a lot. Kindly give your advice at the earliest possible. Thank you.\n\nResponse from Mr. Glenn\n\nThe answer sounds like NO.\n\nYou'd need blood to go from her mouth and go just about immediately\/directly into your mouth and into an open wound. All of that would need to happen. You're missing the directly part. You're also probably missing the part where there was blood in her mouth and on the pen.\n\nGenerally speaking, the mouth is not a good way to get or give HIV.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\nhiv transmission\ntoo scared,,,requesting your feedback\n\n  \u2022 Email\u00a0Email\n  \u2022 Glossary\u00a0Glossary\n\n\u00a0Get Email Notifications When This Forum Updates or Subscribe With RSS\n\n\n\nThis forum is designed for educational purposes only, and experts are not rendering medical, mental health, legal or other professional advice or services.

When I used Flame blast, the box was yellow and it said \u201c3\u201d damage.\n\nasked by\n- Do you mean Flame Burst or Fire Blast?\n- Was this in a double battle?\nCONQUEST, that's the game.\n\n1 Answer\n\n4 votes\n\nAll things considered, Fire Blast should do x2 damage against a Cubchoo, since it doesn't have Thick Fat.\n\nIt might have been holding an Occa Berry, in which case the berry would reduce the damage done by a super effective fire move once, and then the rest of the fire moves will do x2 damage.\n\nEDIT: I just saw what Mew wrote, and that's right.\n\nFlame Burst deals damage. All Pok\u00e9mon (including allies and the user if applicable) adjacent to a Pok\u00e9mon hit by Flame Burst in Double and Triple Battles will lose 1\/16 of their maximum HP in typeless effect damage. This secondary effect will not occur if the target absorbs the primary attack with Flash Fire or the attack misses.\n\nIf it's Flame Burst, it does typeless damage, despite being a fire type move. If it's Flame Burst you're referring to (and not Fire Blast), then that was why it wasn't super-effective against a Cubchoo.\n\n\nanswered by\nedited by\nFlame Burst\nThen it's as Mew suggested; Flame Burst does typeless damage, making Pokemon lose 1\/16 of its health regardless of its type. It would have the same effect on a water Pokemon as it would on an ice Pokemon.",

The graph below works well in showing how many are eligible for a survey (green) vs. how many were actually mailed a survey (orange).\n\n\nThe customer would like me to add a bar to this graph to show the number of people who were eligible for a survey but were not mailed one (thus, I\u2019d be adding a bar to show the difference between the green and the orange bars already present).\n\nGreen bar: COUNT ({Eligible})\n\nOrange bar: This is simply a sum of the column containing either a 0 (no survery mailed) or 1 (survey mailed) : SUM ({MAILED})\n\nThe report has parameters for Country, Date, City (in that order) and is set for all countries.\n\nOK, so the basic core logic is very simple since I just need a formula to show : COUNT ({Eligible}) - SUM ({MAILED}). The trick is to getting this formula to group on the graph in a way that corresponds to each month.\n\nAs a 1st step in this process, I made a formula in an attempt to show just the Count of customers that are Eligible for that month. Since I already have a green bar showing the count of customers each month, I was hoping in my experiment here that my formula would also show the exact same count of eligible customers for each month. Here is the formula\n\nCOUNT({Command.ELIGIBLE},{Command.EVENTDATE}, \"monthly\")\n\nI get results on my graph as shown below but the count of customers only includes the count from the 1st city for each month (instead of the entire country for that month). I am not sure what to do since the formula does not appear to accept multiple groupings.\n\n\nAnyway\u2026 I hope I am making sense and that you might have some suggestions for me. What I want to do seems so simple (calculate the difference between the green and orange bars) so that I can add a bar to the graph showing the customers who were eligible for a survey but did not receive one (seems simple but struggling to achieve) Many Thanks!\n\na1.jpg (161.7 kB)\na2.jpg (181.7 kB)\n10 |10000 characters needed characters left characters exceeded\n* Please Login or Register to Answer, Follow or Comment.\n\n1 Answer\n\nBest Answer\navatar image\nFormer Member Oct 24, 2017 at 02:34 PM\n\nNever mind....I was able to figure it out.\n\n10 |10000 characters needed characters left characters exceeded",
