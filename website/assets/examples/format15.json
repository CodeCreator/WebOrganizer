        "text":"Brunching at Lindey\u2019s\n\n{by alexis}\u2013The best part about hosting out-of-towners is that I get to play tour guide, and usher them to see (and eat!) the best Columbus has to offer. You may remember my good friends Suzanne and Nick from my first blog post ever. This time, they jetted in from Boston to catch the Virginia Tech game (Suze is a dedicated hokie), and after all that football (and maybe a few tears), we were ready for an extravagant brunch the next day. Lindey\u2019s was really the only choice.\n\nWe rolled ourselves out of bed late \u2014 even Indiana Bones slept in! \u2014 and headed out the door. I love surprising guests: they are always shocked to learn we\u2019re walking to the fancy brunch place! Yes, we in Ohio have walking neighborhoods, too!\n\n\nTheir building is the picture of charm, don\u2019t you think? The windows, the awning \u2014 it all works together. I love the design so much, that I actually used their font as inspiration for our wedding invitations! True story!\n\nI love Lindey\u2019s, but know they cater to a particular crowd. We were hustled out of the waiting area so the host could cheerily sit some of his regulars. Just be aware.\n\nAs hungry and tired as we were, we opted to skip the wait and eat in the dining room. The patio is beautiful, but after being exposed to the elements for most of the previous day, I was happy to soak in a little a\/c and get out of the sun. We started where you should always start at brunch: Carpaccio. capraccioI\u2019ve had it before here, and I\u2019d be happy to make this a meal on its own. Everything about this dish is a win: the portabella strips are an earthy pairing, the chipotle aioli has an unexpected kick, and the arugula is the perfect crunch and bitter balance. Honestly, I\u2019d like to wrap all this up like a burrito and eat it, but I have a feeling that might be frowned upon.\n\nSuzanne and Nick chose an heirloom tomato flatbread, which was magnificent in its dollops of cheese and delicate vegetable slices. The flatbread is crispy, light, and makes a perfect appetizer. lindey'sOur main dishes were next up, and they did not disappoint. Suzanne went for this beautiful salmon salad, and reported back that the fish was cooked well, with lots of flavor. lindey'sWe all had a bit of a fight over who got to order the huevos rancheros, but lucky Nick won. He loved the pork belly, citing its crispy texture. I love pork belly, but have had more than a few super fatty pieces, but not here! Nick assured me that this was not one of those incidents.\n\nlindey'sJoe went for the classic benedict. Honestly, the man is a sucker for hollandaise, and can you blame him? Hot butter and egg? I mean. Don\u2019t fight it. lindey'sI ordered the crab & eggs, and it arrived in its own charming, little skillet. The potatoes were perfection: not too salty, and not bland, and the egg was cooked to perfection. And the crab was delightful. It\u2019s rich and sweet and why don\u2019t we always have this at breakfast? Mine came with its own generous helping of hollandaise which took the decadence up an extra notch or two. lindey'sFull and happy, we rolled ourselves home. I\u2019m pretty sure I convinced Suzanne and Nick that fine dining exists outside of the East coast, and so do tree-lined cobblestone streets. Lindey\u2019s is a reliable and beautiful neighborhood gem. Just don\u2019t miss the carpaccio.\n\nLindey\u2019s is located at 169 E. Beck Street. Sun-Thurs, 11am-10pm; Fri-Sat 11am-11pm.\n\n\n2 thoughts on \u201cBrunching at Lindey\u2019s\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

Our strength of schedule is relatively good and should only get better with the match-up with Cincinnati (and I guess Rutgers and UConn). Mississippi State has the chance to be a good game as well.

LSU is the obvious #1, Cal #2, USF #5, Missouri #6, Oklahoma #12, and USC way down at #13. Being ahead of media darlings Oklahoma and USC should give WVU fans a little excitement.

        "text":"Wednesday, September 10, 2008\n\nZombies Eat Brains And Clay\n\nHorror's reach is absolutely never ending, it's tentacles have slithered their way into every medium and it's been made into so many sub-genres. For example, I watched \"Fringe\" last night, which I thought was great, by the way... and it had horror elements, mixed with Sci-Fi, and it's a big network TV show. Some would say that horror's made it's way into music, with guys like Necro, Cradle of Filth and, especially, Rob Zombie, who embody horror elements. Of course, there's film, where you get psycho-thrillers, gore-fests, slasher flicks, you name it... it's almost rare to see a film that doesn't have some element of horror involved. So, as horrors reach continues, sometimes I think we're near a saturation point... I mean, where else could people take it? But, when I saw \"Zombies Eat Brains And Clay\", I realized that we may still be on the tip of the iceberg here.\n\nWhat's \"Zombies Eat Brains And Clay\", you ask? Well, eventually, it's going to be a feature length claymation film. Currently, it's a short film on Youtube, which you'll find embedded below, plus it's a Myspace page, which you'll find here.\n\nAfter watching it and going through their Myspace page, I feel like I've learned a couple things here. One, I love blood and guts that are made out of clay... who knew? Secondly, it just made me think about how there's so much more that can be done in horror. Every time I think I've seen it all, I see something new... on some new medium or in some new form. Whether you think out of the box on how you distribute your idea or content OR you think outside the box on what your idea or content is... the fact remains that there's endless new routes to take out there. We shouldn't get stuck in thinking that you have to make a 90 minute film that conforms to what Hollywood considers standard or acceptable. Get busy making something that isn't standard (or acceptable) and then go find an audience any way you can.\n\nUntil then, enjoy some zombies that, as the title states, eat brains and clay...\n\nNo comments:",

        "text":"Sunday, 25 June 2017\n\nThoughts on two new papers from vulnerability and adaptation research\n\nI read two very interesting papers from adaptation and vulnerability research last week.\n\nIn\u00a0Operationalizing longitudinal approaches to climate change vulnerability assessment, Fawcett et al. (2017) make a case for longitudinal methodological approaches when studying vulnerability and adaptation. The lack of attention paid to temporality has been a long-held peeve of mine (it's gotten so bad that in team meetings, colleagues crack jokes about it). Fawcett et al. use three illustrative cases from Arctic communities to highlight how longitudinal approaches, two in particular \u2014\u00a0cohort studies (following a group of individuals over time) and trend studies (repeated data collected at a community level to reveal patterns of change) \u2014 can strengthen the methodological toolbox of vulnerability research.\n\nI particularly liked how they tease out the benefits of using a longitudinal approach. It helps\n  1. build a more nuanced understanding of adaptation processes and 'causal chains' of vulnerability (something Jesse Ribot has written a lot about, see his work from 1995, 2010, and 2014),\u00a0\n  2. construct a more robust portrayal of what has worked and hasn't, and why, which is crucial for anyone interesting in strengthening, investing in, and implementing adaptation, and\u00a0\n  3. diagnose maladaptive behaviour by looking into past pathways. This last approach is similar to what colleagues and I have taken in a recent project where we use cases from rural and urban India to argue that tracing historical trajectories of development and adaptation actions can help understand how development choices can narrow adaptation option spaces, often leading to potential maladaptation.\nComing back to Fawcett et al. (2017), I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and wholly support their key argument of expanding vulnerability research to involve more longitudinal approaches that begin to capture temporality. While the authors discuss the challenges in doing such research (notably, potential attrition of respondents from original cohorts, the need for sustained funding), I have two questions probing the practice of longitudinal vulnerability assessment approaches:\n  1. The political economy of vulnerability\u00a0assessments: Currently, many NGOs, donors, and governments conduct VAs. How do the authors imagine such actors to undertake longitudinal studies given the budgets, project cycle-time frames, and capacity constraints they work under? This is especially true in government departments in India (we did a review of 120 VAs in India\u00a0found 35% use static, indicator-based approaches). Moreover, in many cases, governments undertake VAs under tight deadlines (for e.g. assessments after a disaster event to inform humanitarian action). The underlying question is how can we build processes and demand for longitudinal vulnerability assessment approaches that feed into shorter-term cycles but also contribute to the larger narratives of vulnerability?\u00a0\n  2. The place of researchers:\u00a0Researchers are a possible 'actor group' that don't face all the challenges noted above, or at least not to a similar extent. However, researchers are increasingly being squeezed into shorter project cycles, insecure employment arrangements, tighter funding structures, and greater calls for impact \u2014\u00a0all of which, may not necessarily be conducive to longitudinal research \u00a0design which needs 1) sustained financial backing, 2) strong, clear and continual leadership, 3) an underlying recognition of the importance of such work, 4) acceptance of delayed gratification.\n\nIn\u00a0Adaptive capacity: exploring the research frontier, Mortreux and Barnett (2017) discuss the emphasis that adaptation research has on quantified assessments of adaptive capacity (predominantly through Sustainable Livelihoods Framework-based (SLF) approaches) without an equal emphasis on how and to what extent adaptive capacity translates in adaptation outcomes. They highlight valuable gaps in adaptation research, most notably, the lack of focus on the process of adaptive capacity (a potential to adapt) being translated into an adaptation outcome (with concrete implications for peoples' vulnerability). The paper reviews emerging literature on risk perception and adaptation decision-making, cognitive barriers to adaptive behaviour, and place attachment, to discuss how these gaps can be addressed.\n\nTo add to their review of literature from disaster risk management and behavioural sciences, I wanted to highlight a few empirical studies exploring the drivers of adaptation behaviour and adaptation outcomes:\n  1. Burnham and Ma (2017) examine farmer adaptation decisions in Loess Plateau, China and find that self efficacy, i.e. one's perception of one's own efficacy to adapt, shapes adaptation behaviour and outcomes significantly. They crucially highlight that in addition to household assets and entitlements, state-society dependencies may reduce farmer perceived self-efficacy. \u00a0\n  2. Drawing on data examining household and intra-household risk perceptions and decisions in rainfed farming families in north-west India, I have argued that different households perceive risk differently and this shapes the adaptation pathways they take. Moreover, I found that adaptation outcomes (measured through environmental, social and economic lenses) change over time based on changing household assets but also changing social structures, policy regimes, and cultural beliefs.\n  3. In a completely different context, Evans et al. (2016) examine social limits to adaptation int he Great Barrier Reef region.They argue that social limits affect adaptation outcomes by dissuading people to take up adaptive action in the first place! Also interactions between psycho-social (or what I call socio-cognitive) and structural factors can adaptation ineffective.\u00a0\nConceptually, it's exciting times for adaptation research. Practically, I feel that while there is a growing body of work around understanding the need for longitudinal vulnerability assessments and factoring in socio-cognitive barriers to adaptation, it hasn't begun to filter into mainstream adaptation implementation and negligibly in policy circles (especially in India, the context I am most familiar with).\u00a0\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...",

        "text":"Experimenting with the Square Format: Using the Spartus Full-Vue With Tungsten Film\n\nmasked spartus\n\n\u00a0The Spartus Full-Vue Twin Lens Camera, 1948-1960.\n\nThe Twin Lens Reflex Camera:\n\nMany notable photographers used twin lens cameras: Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, Lisette Model, and Diane Arbus.\u00a0The first twin lens reflex camera appeared in 1880 as a specially built camera for the Kew Observatory in England. The first production twin lens camera appeared in the 1882, introduced as the Academy\u00a0by the British firm, Marion and Company.\u00a0 The camera, a non-reflex design featured an upper viewing lens held at eye level, and produced the distinctive square image that would come to be associated with twin lens cameras. \u00a0Over the next two decades, nearly every major camera manufacturer offered twin lens reflex cameras standardized on the square format.\u00a0[1]\n\n\nTwin lens reflex cameras feature a mirror mounted behind the viewing lens at a 45-degree angle, reflecting light onto the viewing screen. The upper lens is dedicated to viewing and is mechanically synchronized for focus with the lower lens, which is devoted to film exposure. Usually held at waist level to compose and focus, the twin lens reflex camera offers the advantage of a viewing area identical to the exposure area. Twin lens cameras also offer the advantages of being able to view the exposure as it is being made. In addition, the mirror does not have to move to made the exposure. Traditionally the square format negative was cropped to 8\u00d710 inches, the standard paper size. The large negative of the typical twin lens camera, over 4 times the size of the 35mm camera format, presents advantages for enlargement of selected portions of the image without significant loss of detail. The disadvantages of the twin lens design are the slight disparity between the coverage area of the upper and lower lens, referred as parallax error, and a right to left reversal produced by the mirrored image.\n\n\nThe Square Format:\n\nIn painting and photography, the shape of the picture refers to picture\u2019s format.\u00a0 Because rectangles are so prevalent in our daily lives, we seldom notice the shape of the window, table or the pages of a book. Most paintings and photographs are rectangles. The horizontal or vertical format of the rectangle may evoke the breadth of a landscape or the heights of towering mountains. The compositional flexibility of the rectangle helps to make the format ubiquitous. Invisible to the shape of picture, we notice content of the picture rather and shape of the picture.[2]\n\n\nSince very few subjects are naturally square, photographers using the square format cameras often crop their images into rectangles. However, photographers who make the syntactical decision to use \u00a0the square format do so in support of subject and content decisions, and alerts us that each photograph is a means of representing the world. \u00a0Using a square format camera without cropping the image can enliven subject matter by making the photographer and viewer conscious of the shape of the picture and act of taking a photograph. The square format counters the invisibility of the rectangle, and demands that we consider the shape of the picture as well as what is depicted within the shape. The square format presents a fresh challenge to the traditional golden rectangle variants found in most camera viewfinders.\n\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe Spartus Full-Vue Twin Lens Reflex- the Spartus Camera Corporation in Chicago, Illinois, produced the Full-Vue Reflex from 1948-1960. The camera is a simple to use twin-lens reflex box camera featuring an image in the ground glass viewfinder equal to the negative size. With a large viewing lens the Full-Vue boasts an especially bright viewfinder image.In 1949, the Full-Vue \u00a0also featured a synchronized flash attachment.\u00a0The Spartus Full-Vue\u2019s bakelite body [3]\u00a0is fitted with a fixed focus 92mm Scienar plastic lens and takes twelve 6-centimeter exposures on 120mm film. The Spartus Full-Vue employs a rotary shutter\u00a0and as the Full-Vue manual instructs \u201cthe exposure is then made by gently pressing the exposure lever down as far as it will go.\u201d[4]\u00a0The shutter has only two settings: \u201cinst.\u201d (about 1\/60th of a second) and \u201ctime\u201d (a bulb setting for long exposures).\u00a0\n\n\nUsing the Spartus Full-Vue With Tungsten Film in Daylight:\n\nI loaded Fujichrome T64 Professional 120mm Tungsten film into the Spartus Full View, and used the camera to photograph fall color at three California locations in late October, 2013: in the Alder Grove at Yosemite National Park, along the Tenaya Canyon Creek just outside of Lee Vinning on in the Eastern Sierra and at North Bloomfield in the Nevada County. Tungsten films are calibrated for exposure under indoor studio lighting conditions with a Kevin temperature of 3200k producing a much lower color temperature than daylight, which has a Kelvin temperate of 5500k. When shooting tungsten film in daylight conditions, a 85 filter\u00a0compensates for color temperature disparity and when shooting daylight films in tungsten light conditions, an 80a filter is recommend.[5] Using tungsten film in daylight conditions without color correction filters yields unpredictable results and even with identical exposures on the same roll of film.\n\n\nAt each location, I photographed in basic daylight conditions, and exposed the Fujichrome T64 Tungsten film without color correction and without any using a color correction filter. The Full-Vue\u2019s plastic lens produced spectacularly unpredictable results. The appearance of the monochrome reds was surprising, and the deep blues and magentas produced startling mixes of color. The square format of the Spartus Full-Vue supports the muting of image details in the abstraction of unexpected color.\n\n\u00a9David Arnold, 2014.\n\n\n\n[1] S. F.
