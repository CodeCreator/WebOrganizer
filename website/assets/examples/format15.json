        "text":"Monday, December 13, 2010\n\nMeditations: Live By Faith\n\nA good students knows that when the teacher repeats something, it will probably appear on an upcoming test. When God says anything, we ought to sit up and take notice, but when God repeats something, or says something a third time, we'd better pay attention!\n\nHebrews 10:35-39 - Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. For, \"Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.\" But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.\n\nRomans 1:16-17 - For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, \"The righteous shall live by faith.\"\n\nHabakkuk 2:4 - Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him, but the righteous shall live by his faith.\n\nI'm sure we all want to be counted among the righteous. Psalm 11:7 - \"For the LORD is righteous; He loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.\" To be righteous, we have to live by faith. A quick look through the \"Hall of Faith\" in Hebrews 11 gives us many examples of the righteous and faithful:\n  \u2022 vs. 4 - By faith Abel...\n  \u2022 vs. 5 - By faith Enoch...\n  \u2022 vs. 7 - By faith Noah...\n  \u2022 vs. 8 - By faith Abraham...\n  \u2022 vs. 11 - By faith Sarah...\nAnd the list continues as the Hebrew writer lists more great heroes of faith from the Old Testament.\n\nBut just how do we LIVE by faith? Living by faith is more than just a vague set of beliefs or moral code that we attempt to follow. Living by faith is an active pursuit. The author of Hebrews further describes our efforts in 12:1-2 and 12-15:\nLet us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith...\n\nTherefore, strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed. Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord; looking carefully lest anyone fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become defiled.\nWe are given a wonderful visual aid here to assist us in our understanding. Even those as nonathletic as I am can mentally picture this race... this is not a sprint, it is a marathon, maybe even a cross-country style marathon where we come across muck and mire, hurdles and obstacles. But if we keep our eyes ahead, we can see Jesus, \"the author and finisher of our faith\". He ran the very same race, and after paying the ultimate sacrifice, he sits crowned in glory at the right hand of God, cheering us on as we race to the finish. There is no one winner in this race, rather everyone who finishes will receive the reward. But how do we get there?\n\nMatthew 7:13-14 - \"Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.\"\n\nGo the way of Wisdom: Proverbs 8:20 - \"I traverse the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice.\"\n\nAnd just how do we live by faith?\n  \u2022 vs. 1 - lay aside every weight and sin\n  \u2022 vs. 1 - run with endurance\n  \u2022 vs. 2 - keep your eyes on Jesus\n  \u2022 vs. 12 - strengthen yourself, don't drag along behind! (re: \"Roll the Gospel Chariot\")\n  \u2022 vs. 13 - make straight paths for your feet\n  \u2022 vs. 14 - pursue peace and holiness\n  \u2022 vs. 15 - look carefully - avoid bitterness and trouble, don't let yourself be defiled\nSee how much of this list uses active verbs - run, strengthen, make straight, pursue... We cannot be casual, remember this is a race!\n\nHebrews 10:35-39 - Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...",

        "text":"Saturday, December 26, 2015\n\nTeresa Scott ~ Astral Avatars ~ Becoming Beacons of Light on Treacherous shores\n\nYou can be on the cusp of something.\nAppreciate the cusp, not the something.\nAppreciate this moment now.\nErnest Holmes\n\nAs 2015 begins to slip away, we can feel the rise of 2016\u2019s patterns, potentials, and rites of passage, including a need to de-clutter both our outer and inner lives, to shed karma and increase service, to discard destructive judgments, and to master the tidal waves of impermanence.\n\nIn the 2016 we will be deeply investigating all of these initiatory cycles, in addition to each Mercury retrograde cycle, the Mars Retrograde and 4 transformative Eclipses (dates listed below). This is the year where you must step into the Teacher you have become, but truly, what do you Believe, and what motivates you to Realize your Dream and feel empowered for the transformative year ahead. Focus on your dream and you will bypass the minutia and subterfuge of others drama.\n\nWhat is happening now, as we move to a more telescopic view, getting an overview of the bigger picture \u2013 we are healing the cataclysm between Lumeria and Atlantis. The division is realized in our timeline as a separation between science and spirituality, between experiential reality and \u2018factual\u2019 reality, and the rift between technology\/industrialization versus nature\u2019s way.\n\nThe present 3D incarnated tribes of light are on both sides of the spiritual spectrum and therefore it is important that the massive collective race memory be purified and cleared \u2013 for ourselves and all of earth.\n\nWe are all in for an interesting ride in 2016 (a 9 year of completions) as we all let go of separateness and begin to merge and blend the polar opposites of ideologies - mind, will & emotions, body, soul & spirit!\n\nThe ReGenesis Elohim Team\u00a0has asked for the gathering of qualified individuals who have been through personal and soul-collective initiation, who are ready to engage their master keycodes, gatekeeper codes and signature encodement and come together for healing & training, to be of service in light working in the astral plane, 4D.\n\nWe are called Astral Avatars by the ReGenesis Team and have incarnated, enduring sometimes brutal life experiences and astral\/entity invasion and harassment. My list of outrageous tampering, etc is similar to many I have worked with \u2013 not fun, but necessary to train us to be fearless, to be balanced in chaos and anchored in adeptness in eluding lower density agendas.\n\nAstral Avatars\u00a0\u2013\u00a0uniting the tribes of light\u00a0\u2013 is a community endeavor to positively empowering the spiritual journey of a billion souls.\u00a0 This has already begun here in the Heartland of the US - Kansas City!\n\nOur next Astral Avatar Gathering is January 9th\u00a0\u2013 time and location to be\n\nBe purposeful with your thoughts and emotions\u00a0in the coming days and more consistently with each passing moment, holding firm to the initiate\u2019s parameters.\n\nIn the book, Light on the Path, there are four statements that have been used for centuries by Initiates via meditation and inner concentration. Their meaning is profound and many-sided:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBefore the eyes can see, they must be incapable of tears.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBefore the ear can hear, it must have lost its sensitiveness.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBefore the voice can speak in the presence of the masters, it must have lost the power to wound.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBefore the soul can stand in the presence of the masters, its feet must be washed in the blood of the heart.\u201d\n\nThese four statements have mystical power. But we must bring them to life within us; we must love them and let them guide us, as the needed railing on the precarious bridge between the mind, into the heart.\n\nWe must become anchored in the heart as our new interpretation center. \u00a0All must be perceived from this level in order to see all that is, so that we can become all that we are.\n\nWe have arrived at a powerful juncture in our collective journey. \u00a0We are on the cusp of \u2018something\u2019- struggling to appreciate the passage and not worry about the outcome. The passage between the 12-12 gateway and\u00a0January 17th\u00a0will be a highly transformative for those completing the Resurrection phase, as all unfolds seamlessly. \u00a0Higher echelon blueprints are unfolding by divine design, as the Beacons of Light (Wayshowers) become the guardians of the New Light.\n\nThe Beacons of Light\u00a0are like Light Houses on treacherous shores;\u00a0they are Humble, Devout, Peaceful and Powerful\u00a0Beings\n\nThere are Gatekeepers, Wayshowers, Gridworkers and Lightworkers of the True Light who are entrusted with Divine service - the sacred path to\u00a0become Guardians of the New Light. On a grounded level the challenges to that power, peace and service can be\u00a0plentiful in order for us to find strength and doubtless devotion to Source; a deep inner dedication to Love.\n\n\nNature holds a mirror for the possibilities of composure, who in all changes of weather and seasons has found a way to be resilient. \u00a0T. Scott\u00a9\n\nThere is little room for doubt \u2013 the Holidays can be challenging.\u00a0 I am traveling over the next week and I will be wearing a 'cloak of composure', deep down knowing there is an adventure contained in the journey.\n\nIf you are traveling during the Holidays, wishing you safety, surety, sanity and undisturbed composure,\n\nMay the candle you ignite this holiday season reflect the light of the Beloved.\u00a0 May that light remind you of the risen Solstice Sun within, about to emerge, illuminating its intentions in the 2016 year of Re-Genesis.\u00a0Teresa\n\nEclipses in 2016\n\nMarch 8, 2016\u00a0- Total Solar\nMarch 23, 2016\u00a0- Lunar Penumbra\nSeptember 1, 2016\u00a0- Annual Solar 'Golden' Ring\nSeptember 16, 2016\u00a0- Lunar Penumbra Eclipse\u00a0\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 ReGenesis, All rights reserved.\nYou are receiving this email because you opted in at our website.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

However, now for past 5 years, he sells it in Lajpat Nagar in Morning and at Defence Colony in evening!\n\nMy hajma is Quite good so I skipped the LHPH Churann but got Anardana Churann balls from him which were really good.

I always carry a Band Aid in my Wallet and offered to help. Saw his Finger which had some internal injury and small Blood Clot had appeared which would normally be healed with passage of time. But to pacify them, I told them to use a Band Aid and on application they seem to be happy. Probably a Psychological effect.\n\nNow, they had seen me clicking a Pic & asked me to click one of them and I obliged. I asked them if they have Mail accounts. None of them did.\n\nOne of them pointing a finger towards a Friend said\u2026.. \u201cIsko Bhej do, iske Papa ki Sarkaari naukri hai, wohi net karte hai\u201d\n\nOther pointing to another said \u201cIska Bhai to bahut net use karta hai\u201d\n\nThe Ones in School Uniform were Bunking School and were afraid that they may get caught.

        "text":"Boston Marathon: The things I wish someone told\u00a0me\n\n\nWhen I look around at my running friends I would hardly be the person I\u2019d point to and say \u201cThere\u2019s your expert on the Boston Marathon\u201d. I am privileged to count as friends people that have run\u00a0Boston dozens of times. All of them can and will provide intricate details of the course, and are very helpful with race day strategies. You can also find countless on-line guides to actually running the race. But many Boston veterans\u00a0have forgotten what it\u2019s like to be a rookie there and the things a rookie might want or need to know. So in random order, here are some of the things I wish I knew last year going into my first Boston.\n\nIf you can afford it stay in town.\u00a0I have a lot of running friends for whom Boston is old hat, and has become just another race in their season. Travel, lodging, and meals are done for as little money as possible and the sole focus is getting from the start to the finish and getting out of town. Hey, if that\u2019s your thing I\u2019m not knocking it. But if this is a new event for you, you should really enjoy the atmosphere of Boston on race weekend. I had a positively miserable race last year running-wise but I was continuously amazed by the spirit and excitement of the city and all of it\u2019s people for the entire weekend. In other towns, \u201crace weekend\u201d is an inconvenience and hassle but in Boston everyone is excited for the Marathon. Perhaps a bit of this is still a sense of recovery from the bombings, but everywhere I went, people thanked me for coming, asked me how my race was, asked if I\u2019d be coming back. It was as if I was lifted up on a pedestal just for running from Hopkinton to Boyleston street.\n\nLeave your car home.\u00a0You won\u2019t need it. It will be expensive to park. You can get everywhere on the T or on foot. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help with the T. Once you figure it out it\u2019s pretty simple but not immediately obvious. The locals are happy we are there and will be glad to take the time to help you with tickets and point you to the right platform.\n\nGo to Mike\u2019s Pastry shopIt\u2019s in the North End. Just look for the crowd when you get there. And yes: It\u2019s that good and the line goes fast.\u00a0mikes\n\nYou can see the whole course at the expo.\u00a0I assume they do this every year, but\u00a0last year there was a theatre setup in the middle of the expo where they stream a loop of the course. It is very good. I watched it twice and felt like I was familiar with the course.\n\nThe expo is HUGE.\u00a0Get your packet. Go checkout out the big poster with all the names and find yours, maybe hit a couple specific vendors and the video (above). You can also buy your jacket there. (If I\u2019d have mail-ordered mine I would have gotten the wrong size). They have lots of other apparel too, all mostly overpriced as you can imagine. But focus on race day and don\u2019t expend all your energy at the expo. You can see all that stuff on-line or elsewhere.\u00a0hopkinton\n\nPrepare to walk a lot race morning . . before you ever get to the start.\u00a0Depending on where your hotel is, or where you park, or what T stop you get off you have to do a lot of walking. Last year our hotel had a shuttle to take us to\u00a0Boston Commons where you get on the school buses out to Hopkinton. First, they could only get so close. There are dozens of buses and they had a lot of the city streets choked. It was then necessary to walk the rest of the way to Boston Commons, several blocks more to bag drop. (Just past the finish). Then several blocks back across Boston Commons to the buses. Once there, we waited in line for a bit to get on a bus. The bus ride to Hopkinton isn\u2019t particularly short (closer to 4o minutes than the advertised 20). Once there, there is yet more walking to the athlete\u2019s village. From the athlete\u2019s village it is a few more blocks around to the start. I didn\u2019t have my Garmin on for all this but I\u2019d assume 2-3 miles of walking before hearing the word \u201cGo\u201d.\n\nThe MBTA has the most useful information for getting to and from the start and finish here.\n\nThe BAA map and directions are also helpful though missing some detail.\n\nVolunteer Map\nNot the official version but much more helpful\n\nThings to know about the Athlete\u2019s Village.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 There are 2-3 sections of the Athlete\u2019s Village. Don\u2019t necessarily stop at the first one.\n  \u2022 They have a lot of porta potties. A lot. Still, lines form \u00a0the closer to the start you get. Just give yourself enough time for that last minute pit stop.\n  \u2022 There are a whole bunch more porta potties on the way to the corrals. I didn\u2019t use these so don\u2019t know what the wait time is. But if you want to use them be ready to leave as soon as your wave is called. They are in a big lot off to the left as you get nearer the start.\n  \u2022 Aside from porta potties, the other thing they have a lot of is runners. Unless you\u2019ve arranged to meet friends somewhere specific, don\u2019t expend a lot of energy walking around trying to find people. It is nearly impossible. Find a comfy spot, spread your blanket out, sit\/lay down and chill.\n  \u2022 You can get breakfast there. They have everything. Bagels, bananas and other fruit, Clif products, coffee, water, orange juice. This is helpful since you probably won\u2019t start your race until mid-morning at a time you\u2019d ordinarily be done your long run. Again, seek out the more distant breakfast and drink areas. They will be less busy especially early.\n  \u2022 There are tents but if it were raining no way in hell would everyone be able to fit under the tents. Be prepared if the weather is iffy. Maybe a big cheap golf umbrella or poncho, or cheap plastic rain gear you can leave behind.\n  \u2022 There are roving photographers. Chances are you can get your best pre-race photo ever here. Take the time to get the photo the way you want. The photographer isn\u2019t in a hurry. If you want to take off your warm-up stuff to get your photo in racing attire, do it. They won\u2019t mind.\n  \u2022 Goodwill is your friend. We all know about throw away shirts for racing, but depending on what time you get to the Athlete\u2019s Village, you could be there a while. Go to Goodwill and buy some warm, comfortable stuff to wear while you wait, and ideally an old blanket. Don\u2019t worry. It won\u2019t go to waste. They have people everywhere on your way to the start to collect these things and re-donate them. Last year I had a really nice fleece jacket that I paid something like $1.80 for. I almost hated to get rid of it.\n\n    The athlete\u2019s village\n\nHeartbreak hill isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u00a0Hopefully you haven\u2019t hit race day never having done any hills. Don\u2019t be intimidated by the idea of this hill 20 miles in to the course. Honestly, it isn\u2019t all that bad. Just focus on good running form and be patient. But then if you haven\u2019t run any hills in training perhaps now is a\u00a0good time to panic.\n\nThe Citgo sign is a long way from the finish.\u00a0Everybody talks about the damned Citgo sign and how it means you are almost at the finish. BULLSHIT. You can see that thing\u00a0for miles. It\u2019s no different than somebody yelling \u201cYou\u2019re almost there!\u201d when you aren\u2019t.\n\nThe finish is crazy.\u00a0For a runner it\u2019s awesome. It is downright deafening. For your family or friends it\u2019s gotta be nuts. I would not have any spectators in my circle try to watch from the finish and it has nothing to do with 2013. I think they\u2019d have to get there at 5:00 in the morning to even get near where they could see. If they want to see you go by I think I\u2019d send them out near Coolidge Corner. There was still a lot of people out that way but open space right along the course to easily see and cheer. They\u2019d still have time to walk back and meet you by the time you get done, go through the finish chute, get your post-race food and clothes, etc. The hot tip here would be for them to be on the South side which is the same side as the family meeting area.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a long way to bag pick-up.\u00a0Once you cross the line your journey is not done. There is a long procession through medals, water, blanket, food, photography, and down the road to bag drop\/pick-up. I don\u2019t remember if there was any sort of changing tent. I just put on a dry shirt across from where I picked up my bag and then went off to find my wife. I think I had a towel and dry shorts in my bag but was cramping up too badly to try to change under a towel.\n\nFamily meeting areas.\u00a0Perhaps this was spelled out somewhere but if it was I missed it. The family meeting area is divided up alphabetically. If you knew this, it would be fairly easy to find your family there. Also, AT&T provides booths with plenty of cell phones to call your family or friends. (See map for locations). Of course, they have to be listening or looking for your call. Also, there were a ton of vendors giving out lots of free food samples on Stuart street of the meeting area. Most of this was better than the food in the official food bag.\u00a02015_finishmap\n\nMake sure you family is paying attention to their phone! It\u2019s noisy, and crowded. They aren\u2019t going to hear it ring. Trust me.\u00a0\u2018Nuff said.\n\nThe T is free.\u00a0Yes they DO let you and your family on to the T for free after the race. You hear this rumored but the BAA\u2019s official vague statement\u00a0is that race participants are responsible for the legal use of public transportation. But reality is, they will let you on with your race medal. It\u2019s a couple blocks to the Back Bay station from the family meeting area.\n\nGo to Sam Adams and on to Doyles.\u00a0Sam Adams is fun. They give you a brewery tour. (Yawn.) But then have a pretty fun tasting and give runners a commemorative glass. This is one of many special privileges your bib garners around town post-race. That is all well and good, but be sure to time your visit so you can go to Doyle\u2019s for lunch. Doyle\u2019s is an Irish Pub not far from Sam Adams. They offer a free trolley ride to and from the brewery. Honestly, that trolley ride was the absolute non-running highlight of our visit to Boston. The driver was the most fun guy I\u2019ve ever met and we were all sorry when the ride was o... (truncated)",

I don't know about you, but I feel anxious going out without any on! One of the sprays I\u00a0received\u00a0was the Superdrug 'Flirty Exotic Fruits & White\u00a0Chocolate' body spray. Quite frankly I don't know what is so flirty about spray but I gave it ago nevertheless.\n\nThere are pros and cons to this body spray. One pro is that it does smell really nice! I'm not so sure about the 'exotic fruits' but the white chocolate really comes through in the smell which even my boyfriend noticed. I certainly don't mind smelling of chocolate! Another pro is the price: \u00a31.29, but currently at sale price of 63p! So if you are someone who is on a budget this is definitely handy.\n\nHowever, a big con is that the smell doesn't last very long. It probably lasts about an hour if that, which certainly doesn't make it a long lasting body spray. To keep up the smell you would have to reapply regularly throughout the day which won't help it last a long time. It lasted about a month for me but would have lasted a much less amount of time had I taken it out with me and reapplied throughout the day.\u00a0\n\nFor the cheap price tag and the fact that it is Superdrug's own brand and not a company specified in the field of body sprays, to be honest I wasn't expecting amazing results anyway. If you're looking for something that'll last you'll most likely have to go for a slightly higher price point. But overall if you're on a budget and need something to just carry around with you then this would be an option to consider.\u00a0\n\nWhat body sprays do you use?\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Sunday, September 28, 2008\n\nAnalysis: What does each candidate have to do to win the Vice Presidential debate on Oct. 2?\n\nOne of my favorite moments (38 seconds) from the primary debates. Keep in mind that Biden has a reputation for droning on and on in his answers. Enjoy.\n\nOpinion: Who won the presidential debate on Friday?\n\nBy Tom ShalesSaturday, September 27, 2008; Page C01\nJohn McCain wore the more presidential tie -- that much can be said for him -- but Barack Obama displayed the more presidential temperament, or the kind of demeanor people presumably would want in a president, when the two candidates met at the University of Mississippi last night for their first debate of the campaign.\n\nBoth men seemed well equipped in terms of facts and figures -- especially, as one would expect, dollar figures -- and neither made an outrageous blunder, although McCain did misidentify the new president of Pakistan. More critically, he came across as condescending and even rude to his opponent, a bit of bad behavior especially evident because Obama may have overdone the fair-minded bit in many of his remarks and answers.\n\nImperiously enough, McCain -- who had threatened not to show up for the debate because of America's financial crisis -- seemed determined to avoid even looking at Obama as the debate went on, although they did shake hands at the beginning and end. Many of McCain's answers were preceded with belittling references to Obama as if he were talking to a college freshman way out of his depth: \"I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy,\" was one typical remark.\n\nObama supporters must have been displeased, then, to hear their candidate keep agreeing with McCain, a case perhaps of sportsmanlike conduct run amok. Doesn't Obama want to win?\n\nOn the matter of congressional earmarks and wasteful spending, Obama began one answer with, \"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right . . .\" and later, on an issue related to the Iraq war: \"Senator McCain is absolutely right . . .\" etc., etc.\n\nAfter all the nice-guy stuff from Obama, which may have reached self-defeating levels, it's perhaps not surprising that the most, perhaps only, electrifying moment of the debate was when he finally told McCain he was wrong -- three times in quick and effective succession. This was during debate about the origins of the war in Iraq. \"You were wrong\" about saying the war would be quick and easy, Obama charged, his voice rising. \"You were wrong\" about finding weapons of mass destruction, he continued. And there was one more \"you were wrong\" for good measure.\n\nObama was showing something that his personal appearances have too often lacked: passion. There was strong conviction behind his words, whether one agreed with them or not, and a welcome assertiveness. \"You were wrong\" was an effectively simple declarative sentence, not bogged down in qualifiers the way some of his sentences tend to be. \"We've got to look at bringing that war to a close,\" he said of Iraq; why not just, \"We've got to end that war\"?\n\nAlthough Obama was \"crisper\" than usual, as one commentator noted after the debate, he still may not have been crisp enough. His oratorical skills when giving speeches in vast venues have been amply demonstrated. But in debates and conversations, when he ad-libs, he sometimes seems to be weighing his answers almost too carefully, defusing his own remarks by diffusing them.\n\nDemocrat Paul Begala, one of CNN's army of pundits, criticized both candidates for the way they handled questions on the economy. The whole debate was supposed to deal with foreign policy, but as the economy shuddered and crumbled during the week, it was wisely decided to devote about a third of the debate to that crisis. But as Begala said, a stranger to this planet tuning in the debate wouldn't have known from the candidates' answers and attitudes that America is in the midst of what has been called the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.\n\nInstead their answers were on the theoretical side, with no real sense of urgency. The folks out there in television land, losing their homes to foreclosure or seeing their retirement nest eggs obliterated, deserved more thoughtful and heartfelt answers.\n\nThe debate was moderated by public television's Jim Lehrer, who did a very accomplished job, willing to interrupt or challenge the candidates when they danced around an issue rather than addressing it. His first question was \"Where do you stand on the financial recovery plan\" now being debated in Washington. Both candidates merely reiterated economic policies from past speeches, with McCain preceding his response with a self-serving salute to Ted Kennedy, who was hospitalized earlier in the day.\n\nObama began his response with the usual bromide about America being \"at a defining moment in our history.\" Yes yes, but how will we pay the mortgage when the interest rate goes up for the umpteenth time next month?\n\nLehrer took control. After the meandering palaver from the two men he said pointedly, \"Let's go back to my question\" and repeated it.\n\nSince all three networks had access to the same basic pool video, some networks tried to dress up the picture with identifying decoration. NBC and CNN both had annoying animated graphics in the lower right-hand corners of the screen, just the thing for people who want to watch letters dance or globes spin around, distracting to everyone else. CNN had mercifully ditched its ticker-tape of fun facts, but replaced it with a chart that supposedly showed reactions from a sample group to the candidates' performances. The chart was hard to read and essentially useless.\n\nCBS armed a test group of viewer-voters with \"joy sticks\" to measure their responses to various moments of the debate, but this gimmick also proved to be of little help. A CBS reporter interviewed one man sitting in the room; the man said he thought McCain looked \"stressed.\"\n\nAnd that was that. The research measurement was done by Nielsen Media Research, it was pointed out, the same people who rate television shows. That raised the discomforting specter of equating presidential candidates with sitcoms, soap operas and reality junk.\n\nThis was reality -- the realest kind of reality -- and the debate was, for the most part, encouragingly civilized and not flawed with frivolous name-calling. As NBC's able Chuck Todd put it, \"no lipstick on a pig\" nonsense. If McCain had been more civil, and Obama were more combative and fervent, it would have been better still.\n\nWednesday, September 17, 2008\n\nAnalysis: Is the economy broken? Is the economy in a downward cycle? or Is the economy OK?\n\nTreasury's Paulson Urges Quick Action on Bailout Plan\nRescue Plan Grows to $700 Billion; Similar Measures Urged Overseas\n\nBy Lori Montgomery and David ChoWashington Post Staff Writers Sunday, September 21, 2008; 10:00 AM\n\nTreasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. today urged Congress to move quickly to approve the Bush administration's emergency plan to revive the U.S. financial system, a proposal that officials said yesterday would cost up to $700 billion as it relieved crippled financial institutions of their mortgage-based assets.\n\nPaulson, who was making the rounds of Sunday morning news talk shows explaining the administration's plan, said lawmakers need to reassure credit markets and Wall Street quickly and should not slow the process down by adding proposals onto the emergency bill.\n\n\"The credit markets are still very fragile right now and frozen,\" Paulson said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press. \"We need to deal with this and deal with it quickly.\"\n\nSenior administration officials meanwhile yesterday pressed their counterparts in Japan, Germany, Britain and elsewhere to establish similar programs to rescue their own troubled firms in what would be an unprecedented bailout of the worldwide financial system. The move comes in recognition that complex interconnections among financial institutions have created a global crisis that the United States cannot solve alone.\n\nAs part of his television interviews today, Paulson said foreign banks would be eligible for assistance under the U.S. rescue plan because \"if a financial institution has business operations in the United States, hires people in the United States, if they are clogged with illiquid assets, they have the same impact on the American people as any other institution.\"\n\nCongressional leaders responded positively to the administration's rescue plan, though the price tag they received yesterday was $200 billion higher than they had been told to expect just three days ago. But House Democrats said they would push to include a number of contentious provisions that could make it difficult to pass the plan quickly, including limits on executive compensation for firms that unload their bad assets on the government and new powers for bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages on primary residences.\n\nDemocrats also want President Bush to drop his opposition to a second round of federal spending aimed at stimulating the economy. While the administration's bailout plan would insure the money market funds of millions of ordinary Americans and help prop up the mortgage market, some Democrats worry that it will primarily be viewed as a bailout for big Wall Street firms.\n\n\"Obviously, this is of direct benefit to some people in the financial industry,\" Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said of the rescue plan. \"We need to be talking about direct benefits to people who are not in the private sector.\"\n\nBush, speaking to reporters during a White House appearance yesterday with Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe, urged Democrats to set aside those demands. In talks with congressional leaders, Bush said he \"found a common understanding of how severe the problem is\" and the need for urgent action. \"We need to get this done quickly and, you know, the cleaner the bett...
