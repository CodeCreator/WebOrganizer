        "text":"On terminology: A sufi polemic against the \u201cmutafaqqih\u016bn\u201d of Damascus\n\nReading Ignaz Goldziher\u2019s summary (1874) of a sufi\u2019s lament over the corruption of Syrian Islamdom under the Mamluks, I was struck by the sufi\u2019s choice in terminology.\n\nThe Maghrib\u012b born \u02bfAl\u012b b. Maym\u016bn attacks current practices of the jurists and sufis of Syria (and Damascus, in particular) but in the title of his work Bayy\u0101n ghurbat al-isl\u0101m bi-w\u0101si\u1e6da \u1e63infai al-mutafaqqiha wa-l-mutafaqqira min ahl Mi\u1e63r wa-l-Sh\u0101m wa-m\u0101 yal\u012bhim\u0101 min bil\u0101d al-a\u02bdj\u0101m he does not use the common terms faq\u012bh and \u1e63\u016bf\u012b. Rather, he refers to them as mutafaqqih\u016bn and mutafaqqir\u016bn. This grammatical form opens up a wide semantic field.\n\nA quick search on shamila shows that these terms are overall uncommon. They only appear ever so often throughout the different Arabic disciplines. Ibn Maym\u016bn seems an exception in using them throughout his work. So what does that mean? Does he use them in a polemic, perhaps even propagandistic way? The use of the form tafa\u02bf\u02bfala is peculiar in itself. Whereas faq\u012bh commonly refers to an accomplished jurist, this form indicates a more abstract notion, describing those people who follow the way or approach of fiqh (jurisprudence) to gain understanding of God, whereas the mutafaqqir\u016bn, in contrast to the accomplished fuqar\u0101\u02be, only aspire to gain the same knowledge by a different path (but have not achieved it yet). These might respond to the distinction of two categories of knowledge (\u02bfilm al-\u1e93\u0101hir \/ \u02bfilm al-b\u0101\u1e6din), Ibn Maym\u016bn uses in an earlier work (Goldziher 1874, p. 301). The grammatical form can further be interpreted as meaning \u2018those who pretend to be jurists \/ sufis\u2019. In the light of the general argument of the work, this seems most plausible.\n\nThis notion of the state of Syrian scholarship and sufism becomes clearer in the course of Ibn Maym\u016bn\u2019s argument, which, after starts out with plead for a reconciliation of both approaches, proceeds to outline all the faults of Syrians in both areas. The individual points addressed by Ibn Maym\u016bn (and summarized by Goldziher) are all intriguing on their own account. They offer insight into a number of contemporaneous practices, the Maghrib\u012b sufi regarded as wrong and dangerous.\n\nYet, they seem to only illustrate what he outlines already in the title of the work: His choice in terminology already diminishes the status of both Syrian sufis and jurists a priori, casting them down from full fledged representatives of their respective status groups to mere aspirants to the knowledge, these approaches offer.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

In this cosmic dynamism, they keep shifting from one stage to another, within the same cosmic space. Housing preferences and choices, like any other life interests, therefore operate within this framework. Unlike merchandized products brands, housing brands are hardly known, probably because of the heterogeneous nature of the housing product - the house. However, very little is known about the relevant housing attributes (refer to page 7). Housing preferences and choices operate within the framework of preferences and choices for housing attributes. In any preference and choice activity, there are underlying motivations that make it possible for an individual to choose from available alternatives within a given product field. This paper examines and outlines the methodological and theoretical framework of housing preferences and choices, based on the theory of means-end chain (MEC). Previous MEC applications in the field of architecture and urban design have been very useful and successful. The paper attempts to explore from literature the possibility of extending the previous methods and their applicability in design process. In dealing with user preference for housing, there is a need for research for a development of a technological tool to identify user needs and preference, and the kind of decision support that is required to identify these needs.\n\nItem Type:Article\nUncontrolled Keywords:housing preference and choice, means-end chain, laddering technique, models\nSubjects:N Fine Arts > NA Architecture\nDivisions:Built Environment\nID Code:37106\nDeposited On:31 Mar 2014 11:32\nLast Modified:15 Feb 2017 08:53\n\nRepository Staff Only: item control page",

        "text":"LeFavour, \"Acting 'Natural': Vanity Fair and the Unmasking of Anglo-American Sentiment\"\n\nSullen Fires Across the Atlantic:\nEssays in Transatlantic Romanticism\n\nActing \"Natural\": Vanity Fair and\nthe Unmasking of Anglo-American Sentiment\n\nCree LeFavour, New York University\n\n  1. A popular hit in the United States, W.M. Thackeray\u2019s Vanity Fair is useful for underlining how one of the staples of the sentimental novel\u2014the training of the mind and \"heart\" that Thackeray so mercilessly mocks as artificial\u2014is itself implicated in so many mid-nineteenth century Americans\u2019 expression of anxiety over female novel-reading. In this context, Becky Sharp\u2019s \"naturalness\" and her explicit rejection of books and female self-improvement at once invite a reconsideration of the naivet\u00e9 and simplicity critics have often assumed in their discussions of American domestic fiction, while at the same time drawing attention to the contentious debates over the moral status of novels themselves and the kind of cultural work they did.\n\n  2. I have chosen Vanity Fair as an example of a popular British reprint during this period because Thackeray\u2019s cynical manipulation of the sentimental genre invites analysis of the period\u2019s dominant historiography that posits a literary landscape dominated by American sentimental fiction. Vanity Fair\u2019s strong presence in the American market invites the dissolution of the monochromatic sentimentality that critics still too often expect of American women\u2019s novels at mid-century, while Thackeray\u2019s novel\u2019s popularity in the U.S. provides an opportunity to examine what critics, and presumably readers, valued about novels and why. In other words, I use Becky Sharp to approach the problem of how British reprints alter the popular American literary market precisely because she is such an overtly anti-sentimental character. Becky raises the question of the place of feminine individualism in literature, or, as Gillian Brown writes, \"the alignment of the individualistic self and its representations with anti-sentimentalism\" (Brown 136). The traditional identification in American literary history of popular literature with a tame, feminized domesticity, and of individualism and the integrity of self with more \"literary,\" masculine works of fiction, is nicely spliced by a figure such as Becky. Because she is so self-interested, a reading of her in the American context invites an analysis of the relation between her authenticity or \"naturalness\" as represented by Thackeray and her status as a popular, if reviled, female figure in a wider spectrum of reading. In turn, the value of Thackeray\u2019s narrative being perceived as \"true to life\" or \"realistic\" by antebellum American critics is placed in opposition to the troubled representation of authenticity in American sentimental culture.\n\n  3. Put very simply, it is the struggles with natural passion and raw impulses, and the training of the mind and \"heart,\" that is at the center of much of this period\u2019s \"sentimental\" writing, just as the same struggle with passions\u2014in which the battle is lost\u2014predominates the widely read sensation and subversive fiction that David Reynolds has identified in Beneath the American Renaissance. Vanity Fair\u2019s explicit rejection of female self-improvement in this context invites a reconsideration of the naivet\u00e9 and simplicity critics have often assumed in their discussions of American domestic fiction. Indeed, sustaining the construct of an enclosed body of \"domestic\" or \"sentimental\" fiction that comprised the whole of American women\u2019s reading has long since been shown to be untenable. And yet, the idea that popular female reading was quite explicitly defined in terms of British reprints throughout the 1850s remains untested.\n\n  4. Reprinted in the United States by Harper & Brothers in 1848, the first volume of Vanity Fair was issued on July 29, with volume two on August 19 of the same year. For this first American edition, illustrated by the author, one hundred pounds was probably paid for proofs. Later that year, Harper issued a one-volume edition, which sold for $1 in paper and $1.25 in cloth (Dzwonkoski 195). In the absence of a copyright agreement with England, under the period\u2019s \"courtesy of the trade\" agreements, Harper\u2019s payment should have secured their sole right to publish Vanity Fair in the American market. As was frequently the case, this \"courtesy\" was not entirely respected. In fact, even in the relatively civilized publishing atmosphere of the late 1840s, it did not take long for other editions of Vanity Fair to appear, each priced at $1. The first is advertised from the Cincinnati firm H.B. Pearson in 1854, and the other is from the New York publisher, Bunnel and Price, available no later than 1854 (Tidball 7; Vose 124). In addition, the German firm Tauchnitz did not adhere to what it regarded as an American practical agreement, even though Tauchnitz did publish its books in the United States. The three-volume Tauchnitz edition of Vanity Fair was advertised in the book industry trade paper of the day, The Publisher\u2019s Circular and Weekly Gazette in 1857 at 40 cents a volume, along with the works of Dickens and Bront\u00eb (Publisher\u2019s Circular 27).\n\n  5. Harper\u2019s right to exclusive publication of Vanity Fair was not maintained, and yet Harper\u2019s market share of the reprint business was high and, despite the presence of two or more small competitors, it is apparent that Harper itself did a brisk business in printing and reprinting Vanity Fair throughout the 1850s, including multiple printings dated 1848, 1857, and 1860 (Union Catalog 512-3). This does not mean that Harper only issued the novel in these years. Rather, it means Harper issued the novel with a new title page in these years, reusing the initial printing\u2019s 1848 title-page plate in subsequent printings for reissue through 1857. It is impossible to say, therefore, how many times Harper published Vanity Fair during these years. Vanity Fair was issued again and again by Harper over the course of the 1850s but because the general dating practices of the period are inconsistent, finding a complete count of either various publishers\u2019 editions or Harper copies of Vanity Fair is not possible.\n\n  6. In the absence of absolute numbers, reconstructing Vanity Fair\u2019s rank in the marketplace argues for a brief analysis of that marketplace during this period as well as an assessment of the novel\u2019s critical and cultural impact in print. The novel\u2019s sales in the United States arose in no small part out of American readers\u2019 long dependence on British fiction, which in turn was in part a result of market conditions.\n\n  7. Thackeray, whose fame as a novelist was made on both sides of the Atlantic by Vanity Fair, did not simply achieve fleeting recognition but became an important cultural referent in a nation preoccupied with propriety, sincerity, and the moral dangers exemplified by Bunyan\u2019s and Thackeray\u2019s Vanity Fair. High rates of literacy in the United States compared to England helped to create a healthy publishing industry that was largely dependent on reprinting British books. As I have argued, this fact forms the foundation of debates over the passage of an international copyright law, with laborers\u2019 concerns, and concerns about sustaining the industry from top to bottom, providing the most consistent and compelling reasons for opposing passage of what might seem (and certainly seemed to Dickens) to be a just and fair law. But Thackeray and Dickens both benefited enormously from the reprinting of their books in the United States: they were paid for advance sheets, rights to serial reproduction, and later their American tours were money-making ventures.\n\n  8. As might be expected of such a widely read work, Vanity Fair was frequently referenced and reviewed, but it was given decidedly mixed notices from critics. Not only was the novel noted in short and long reviews when first published, it was discussed again and again as critics surveyed Thackeray\u2019s work as a whole during his lecture tours and compared it with his subsequent novels, including Pendennis, The Virginians, and The Newcomes (Flamm 56-9). These often contradictory reviews document the novel\u2019s visibility and presence in the American market, which I will discuss at greater length below, and they provide an opening into the values and priorities of the era\u2019s reviewers. While these values are certainly not identical to readers\u2019 values, some correspondence can be claimed where dominant themes can be recognized and shown to be widely shared. I want to underline two points: first, the emphasis on and appreciation of \"realism\" and second, the predominant interest in the morality or immorality of Becky Sharp and her perceived effect on readers.\n\n  9. These two points may seem disparate, but they are in fact linked by the still somewhat tenuous positioning of novels in the culture. Because morality is frequently characterized by critics and commentators as an intrinsic quality of a text that cannot be separated from that text\u2019s social effects, these effects are perceived as ineffective in the absence of \"realism.\" What I mean by this is what must be called \"literary\" standards cannot be separated from moral judgment. Given the still-contingent status of novels as a legitimate form of culture, their perceived role in shaping female morality and decorum, the positive social effects of novel reading were linked to certain standards of verisimilitude and were not seen to occur at all in overwrought, implausible, or absurd narratives. Realism, then, was cause for praise, as a reviewer notes in an article titled \"Novels of the Season\" in The North American Review (October 1848):\n\n    Of all the novels on our list, Vanity Fair is the only one in which the author is content to represent actual life. His page swarms with personages whom we recognize at once as genuine. It is also noticeable, that Thackeray alone preserves himself from the illusi... (truncated)",

In this paper we examine opportunities in Slovakia for two land use activities, reforestation and short-rotation forest plantation, using four scenarios. In order to evaluate alternative GHG emission reduction policies, of carbon sequestration supply curves were constructed for both activities, for all regions in the country. Our regionally detailed results apply novel modeling approaches involving spatially explicit analyses of land biophysical and economic productivity that are easily applicable to other transition countries.\n\nThe overall theoretical maximum sequestration potential on agricultural land by reforestation in Slovakia accounts for approximately 10% of national CO2 emissions. More realistic scenarios, focusing on lower quality marginal land have a potential for carbon sequestration of approximately 1.7%-2.4% of total CO2 emissions. In our estimations, potential maximum use of biomass for bio-energy, using all available agricultural land, would be 64% of renewable energy consumption, with reference to average usage during 1997-2002. Realistic potentials of bio-energy generation on lower quality land may cover about 6% of total demand. We conclude by discussing needs to integrate biophysical and economic model estimates of carbon sequestration potential with local and regional information collected through a stakeholder engagement process. Overall, we argue that there is a necessity to embed carbon sequestration activities within regional development plans, and to back up land use and forest policies with adequate economic incentives and public engagement in environmental decisionmaking.\n\nItem Type: Monograph (IIASA Interim Report)\nResearch Programs: Modeling Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes (LUC)\nDepositing User: IIASA Import\nDate Deposited: 15 Jan 2016 08:40\nLast Modified: 29 Oct 2016 19:56\nURI: http:\/\/pure.iiasa.ac.at\/8429\n\nActions (login required)\n\nView Item View Item\n\nInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)\nSchlossplatz 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria\nPhone: (+43 2236) 807 0 Fax:(+43 2236) 71 313",

We investigated the consequences of 2 missense mutations, R768W and Q1382R, of nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of the multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2; ABCC2) that were previously identified in patients with DJS. Pulse chase analysis revealed that the precursor form of the wild-type and Q1382R MRP2 were converted to the mature form, which is resistant to endoglycosidase H (Endo H) in about 60 minutes. However, the precursor form of the R768W MRP2, which is sensitive to endoglycosidase H, was degraded within 120 minutes and did not mature to the fully glycosylated form. Proteasome inhibitors inhibited the degradation of the precursor form of the R768W MRP2. Unlike the R768W MRP2, the Q1382R MRP2 was mainly localized on the apical membrane in the wild-type form. However, efflux of glutathione monochlorobimane (GS-MCLB) and ATP-dependent leukotriene C4 (LTC4) uptake into plasma membrane vesicles from cells expressing the Q1382R MRP2 were markedly reduced, suggesting that the Q1382R MRP2 on the apical membrane was nonfunctional. Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping with 8-azido-[\u03b1-32P]ATP in the wild-type MRP2 was stimulated by estradiol glucuronide (E217\u03b2G) in a concentration-dependent manner but that in the Q1382R MRP2 was not.

        "text":"Printer Friendly\n\nThe nature and role of ideology in the modern Cambodian state.\n\nCambodia's modern history in the half-century since regaining independence from France has been divided into six clearly defined regimes. The first of these, for the purpose of this article, will be identified as the Sangkum Reastr Niyum (People's Socialist Community) or simply the Sangkum, because this mass political movement created by Prince Sihanouk in 1955 is more alive as an entity in popular memory than the official Kingdom of Cambodia, which governed the country constitutionally from 1947 until the coup d'etat of 18 March 1970 delivered the Khmer Republic. Five years of bitter civil war sparked by the coup gave victory to the radical social revolutionaries who ruled over Democratic Kampuchea until they were driven out in January 1979 by members of a more moderate, Vietnam-backed faction of the original Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) which created the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). (1) In April 1989, this regime transformed itself into the State of Cambodia, which served as a bridging government until an internationally sponsored peace process helped to create a political environment considered sufficiently neutral for democratic elections, which took place in May 1993. The government of what is now known once again as the Kingdom of Cambodia is now in its third legislature.\n\nEach of these regimes governed according to a written constitution approved, in most cases, by a popularly elected legislative assembly. In general, however, Cambodian citizens have been poorly served by their constitutions. In the absence of supporting state institutions, particularly an impartial judiciary, rights guaranteed by successive constitutions have not been delivered or protected, or have been only poorly so. The same politicians who swear defence of the constitution just as easily subvert, manipulate or simply ignore it with impunity. Instead of constitutional guarantees, Serge Thion notes, nepotism, corruption and factionalism--and he might have added politically motivated killings--have been 'means of governing' Cambodia since independence from France in 1953. (2) These features of government apply with some variation in degree but little by way of nature to each of the post-independence regimes, which otherwise differed radically in political persuasion and generally divorced themselves from the preceding regime by forceful and even brutally violent means.\n\nThe Cambodian constitutions, according to Raoul Jennar, are not representative and are not 'snapshots' of the corresponding regime. 'At the very most', he argues, 'they allow one to observe the principal preoccupations of the ruling class, including the image of the country they hoped to offer to the outside world.' Those preoccupations, which are consistent, he says, include territorial integrity, claims to neutrality and non-alignment and the permanence of an omnipresent state. It is this third characteristic that draws the most fire from Jennar's analysis of the constitutions:\n   Even in the 1993 constitution which appears to be the most liberal,\n   state pretensions to interfere in the private sector and to shape\n   individuals according to cultural or ideological criteria are still\n   present.... Any liberties proclaimed are always conceded, always\n   subject to the discretion of the authorities.... Until now, the\n   ruling class has always refused to accept Cambodians as responsible\n   actors. The rights and liberties which they have sometimes enjoyed\n   did not belong to them. Being granted, they could also be taken\n   away. (3)\n\nIf we accept the argument that the Cambodian state, as evidenced by successive constitutions, aims 'to shape individuals according to cultural or ideological criteria', what ideology or ideologies have provided the basis for these criteria? Despite the vast differences in political orientation, have there been consistent preoccupations within the ideologies of successive Cambodian regimes since independence, as there have been within the constitutions? An answer to this latter question may help to explain the ideological underpinnings, or lack of them, of the Hun Sen regime and perhaps provide reasons for its longevity. This article is concerned with ideology as theory or 'ism', rather than with its social function as an instrument of hegemony. As Jennar implies, hegemony is taken for granted by the Cambodian ruling elite, who have historically assumed the passive acquiescence of the masses--particularly the rural masses--and relied upon the unifying force of Khmerness, the spiritual sense of belonging to a discrete cultural group, to legitimise their use of power. Unlike the drafting of constitutions, formulation of state ideology does not invite mass participation. (4) Ideology is the domain of the ruling group, whose members are recognized as its adherents; thus, by corollary, those who do not share its worldview are excluded from the benefits of power-holding, from the exercise of those 'means of governing' to which Thion referred.\n\nAs will be demonstrated, successive Cambodian state ideologies fit well with Theda Skocpol's definition of them as 'idea systems deployed as self-conscious political arguments by identifiable political actors ... developed and deployed by particular groups or alliances engaged in temporally specific political conflicts or attempts to justify the use of state power'. (5) Ideologies, Douglas Kellner adds, 'provide theories about the economy, state, or education that legitimate certain dominant institutions and ideas, and prescribe conformist acceptance.... [They] are value-laden to the core, and are directly related to social practice ... but not effective or credible unless [they] achieve resonance with people's experience'. The power of an ideology, he contends, 'resides in its ability to give birth to a new view of the world and to motivate its advocates to political action'. (6)\n\nUntil early 1985, when the National Assembly confirmed the appointment of Hun Sen, former minister for foreign affairs and deputy prime minister, as prime minister of the PRK, each Cambodian post-independence regime ruled in the name of an idiosyncratic idea system, an identifiable ideology, to justify its use of state power and to explicate a worldview to which the masses were expected to commit themselves. King Norodom Sihanouk abdicated in 1955 in order to involve himself directly in the Sangkum government, and he personally developed its ideology of Buddhist socialism. The Khmer Republic, which idealized the modern political principles of the United States, adopted Neo-Khmerism to justify usurping the throne. The Khmer Rouge struggled to fit their class analysis into orthodox Marxism and to proceed with revolution 'in one country' as the Chinese Communist Party had done until, as if defeated by the effort, they resorted to the xenophobia of the preceding regime in order to unite their forces and justify their power.\n\nEarly leaders of the PRK, trained in socialist theory and dialectic in Vietnam, believed they could revive the revolution by taking it back to 'genuine' Marxism-Leninism. Their efforts had already failed some years before international socialism itself lost appeal as the ideology of a worldwide leftist movement. Immediately after taking executive power, Hun Sen used his position and his party status to effect sweeping changes to the administration in order to facilitate liberal economic reforms. These were pragmatic reforms; the PRK did not espouse capitalism or liberalism between 1985 and 1989, it simply discarded socialist economic practices. During peace talks leading up to the resolution of the Cambodia problem in October 1991, it was agreed that the monarchy would be restored in a manner to be defined by the constitution.\n\nIn the two decades that Hun Sen has been his country's prime minister, Cambodia has seemingly lacked an indigenous idea system to identify the philosophical character of its ruling elite. The restoration of Cambodian society and state institutions has been effected in the absence of any discernible overarching ideology. By contrast, each previous regime up to 1985 left behind documentary evidence attesting to its core principles. In the case of the Sangkum, there was such a surfeit of propaganda literature that, according to Milton Osborne, 'the country's one mass political movement came close to being befuddled by words and speeches into imagining that there was a consistent and operative link between these public expressions of views and the actions which the prince's government took'. (7) This was indeed the case. Those persistent 'means of governing', along with other entrenched official habits, always intervened to thwart the ideologues. The aim here is not to assess the ideology of successive Cambodian regimes in terms of applied outcomes. Through the study of a selection of key documents, however, some consistent characteristics should emerge which can be tested against statements and goals of the current regime in order to propose what might loosely be termed an ideology for the Hun Sen era of Cambodian politics.\n\nIdeology in the Sangkum\n\nPrince Sihanouk argued that ideology was an imperative factor in the construction of a modern state. In an article entitled 'Notre Sangkum' which first appeared in Le Monde in October 1963, he explained:\n   [T]he creation of the People's Socialist Community did not only\n   respond to the necessity of putting an end to the quarrels and\n   rivalry of parties and political groupings and bringing them\n   together in a vast movement of unity. In fact, independent Cambodia\n   imperatively had to give itself a political and social ideology on\n   which it could support itself while building itself as a modern\n\nThe monarchy and the Buddhist religion, those 'irreplaceable factors of unity' in Cambodia, had to be complemented by what he termed the 'birth or ...

Is it possible to step back into those times when there was no time for remembering what normal life was like, those days when we adapted to chaos and struggled for survival...? The distance of the years\u2014forty of them\u2014has put events for us into perspective, many believe. It seems to me though, that this perspective, under the pretense of insight, easily turns into simple hindsight, reshaping what was...How will my recollections stand up against this trap? And where do I start?\nLisa Fittko, \"The Story of Old Benjamin\" (Benjamin, 1982, V\/2, 1184-1185) [ii]\nWe walked slowly, like tourists enjoying the scenery. I noticed that Benjamin was carrying a large black briefcase, which he must have picked up when we had stopped at the inn. It looked heavy and I offered to help him carry it. 'This is my new manuscript' he explained. 'But why did you take it for this walk?' 'You must understand that this briefcase is the most important thing to me,' he said. 'I cannot risk losing it. It is the manuscript that must be saved. It is more important than I am.'\nLisa Fittko, \"The Story of Old Benjamin,\" (Benjamin, 1982, 5\/2, 1187)\nAnd always in the name of the salvation of the trace, here of the manuscript to be saved, at the instant of death, during the Second World War, the following, which Michel Lisse has also brought to my attention:\"Whatever happens, the manuscript must be saved. It is more important than my own person.\" (Walter Benjamin to Lisa Fittko, cited by Bernard Witte, Walter Benjamin: Une Biographe, trans. Andr\u00e9 Bernold [Paris: Le Cerf, 1988, p. 253])\nJacques Derrida, Demeure: Fiction and Testimony (Derrida, 2000, 113)\n\n0. Terminus \/ Zero Degree \/ \"Reject,\" \"Reject,\" \"Reject\"\n\n[1] Some time, probably a little after 2.00pm or 3.00pm on September 26, 1940, Walter Benjamin was refused entry to Spain at Port-Bou. His papers were not in order. He lacked the requisite exit visa from France\u2014a visa that had become essential only that day. He presents his papers and the border guards reject them. He is forced to spend the night at a local hotel, where, later that night, he dies. His death was, perhaps, from natural causes. It was, perhaps, a suicide. It was, perhaps, as a very few conjecture, murder.\n\n[2] As Momme Brodersen, his biographer, tells us, in a letter dated 26 May 1939 the German Embassy in Paris had been informed that the Gestapo's request for Walter Benjamin's expatriation had been granted (Brodersen, 1996, 240). Thereafter Benjamin had essentially been on the run, joining an ever-growing flow of stateless persons or apatrides who were fleeing to the West\u2014not quickly, but in an achingly slow relation to the German advance. Rumors were rife, and as the numbers swelled, the various authorities demanded more and more papers of these refugees. Doors opened and closed, opened and closed, and then closed for good. Escape was an uncertain, changing direction; it's compass indexed not to the terrain but to the possibility of laying your hands on the right document, the right piece of paper, that would enable you to exit to Spain, the US, Cuba, or wherever. [iii]\n\n[3] In Port-Bou, Benjamin reached the end of the line. He made four phone calls (we know not to whom). He wrote one last letter, which was destroyed and then reconstructed from memory. And that night, he died. Among the objects in his possession was a black leather briefcase. This briefcase has since gone missing. Its whereabouts remain unknown. There was for a few years a grave, it is said, but this grave went missing also. Now there is a monument that you may visit.\n\n[4] In 1980, by chance, it came to light that there had been, perhaps, a manuscript in the briefcase, a manuscript that Benjamin is said to have said was \"more important\" than his \"own person.\" But already, on September 26, 1940, this manuscript had gone missing. There is no mention of it in the official records that such hotel deaths occasion. It remains missing to this day.\n\n[5] Understandably, the news that there had been and perhaps that there remains, still, a manuscript, that this briefcase had been, all along, as it turns out, a thoroughly competent briefcase, a briefcase that could still, perhaps, under the right circumstances, and with a little luck or a lot of archival digging, be opened, and the manuscript retrieved, has caused much excitement. Benjamin's editors have inquired into its whereabouts. All manner of writers have ventured to Port-Bou in search of it or of something. When they get there and find nothing, draw a blank, they set about supplementing its absence with their own texts. Benjamin's briefcase becomes something to write with or on, their blocked mourning becomes instead a botched or partial mimesis that delivers, posthumously, after the fact, the manuscript that is said to have been, and which might still be, but which is not yet\u2014a manuscript which History, so it seems, has rejected, thrown away, and whose rejection Benjamin's readers, all of us, if we got really lucky, might be able to undo.\n\n[6] My aim in this essay is to present what I call an \"invent\/story\" of this manuscript's emergence as a lure or relay in the production of Benjaminiana or Benjamin-themed texts and objects. In what follows, I aim to discern the various lineaments that make up its figural presence as a salvific lure, a manuscript, forever rejected, but by this rejection, funding forever the possibility of its posthumous return, its acceptance, and by that acceptance, some order of recuperation or redemption that will derive a stable meaning from Benjamin's death, from your death, my death, from death itself.\n\n[7] As inventory, my essay proceeds by counting and listing variously mediatized or backed performances of this story and the way each stages these fragments or anekdota (stories and writing not intended for publication but which, nevertheless, come to light in uncanny places). My hope is to render each fragment with an eye to the specificities of its staging\u2014and so to offer what, along with Richard Burt, I have learned to call a close\/d reading, a reading content to trace the surfaces of Walter Benjamin's briefcase, to allow it to remain closed, and thereby resist the narratives of restitution and revelation that it sets in motion. An inventory seems an appropriate genre with which to present this case of reception\u2014a genre specific to the parceling out of a dead person's belongings in a probate settlement or to the experimental aesthetics of the avant garde writer, Georges Perec, who once upon a time, in 1974, kept an inventory of all the things he had \"ingurgitated\" that year. [iv]\n\n[8] As invention or storying, my essay tries also to reckon with the economy of reference at work always in reading and so to communicate the intoxicating flavor of the figural briefcase \/ manuscript \/ life figure as it winks in and out of Being. It's a quality that, like Maurice Blanchot's narrator in \"The Instant of My Death,\" I do \"not know quite how to translate.\" For the temporality of this briefcase and the manuscript it is said to contain (maybe, or still) occupies an analogous \"instant\" to that of the young man's almost death by firing squad in Blanchot's story. The narrator describes it as a \"feeling of lightness that I do not know how to translate\" (Derrida, 2000, 7-9)\u2014a moment that oscillates: \"freed from life? the infinite opening up? Neither happiness, nor unhappiness.\" \"I am alive. No you are dead\" (Derrida, 2000, 8-9).\n\n[9] Threatened all the time with its annihilation by the discovery of the manuscript that either, by its newness (Wow!) or its anti-climactic familiarity (What? That old thing again?), settles the score, the briefcase\/manuscript dyad hovers between pure figurality and a potentially catastrophic phenomenalization. By its absence, the briefcase's dimensions, its status as a device for storage, transport, and retrieval, creates the possibility, all this while, of an unknowable, unfathomable future, and with it redemption. That said, the moment of phenomenalization, coded as it is by a high stakes game of revelation, will, in the event that it occurs, pull the figure apart, returning the briefcase to the status of a mere container, and reuniting (as if come Judgment Day) the manuscript with Benjamin's corpus. The briefcase\/manuscript\/life articulation is quite \"literally\" virtual. The impression it leaves in the archive is hardly any impression at all.\n\n1. The Posthumous Impression: Walter Benjamin \/ Benjamin Walter\n\n[10] It begins then, always and again, with a briefcase, or with the mention of a briefcase and its relation to a manuscript\u2014a manuscript that will be said to be more important than a man's life. But this briefcase, as it was archived, as its material existence in the object word was recorded, did not belong to Walter Benjamin, but instead to his posthumous double, the \"Benjamin Walter\" who died, as the official record shows, at 10.00pm on September 26, 1940 in his room at the hotel, Fonda de Francia, in Port-Bou, Spain. \"Benjamin\" is a popular Catalan first name. And so, following his death, it was assumed that Dr. Walter Benjamin was, in fact, not Dr. Walter Benjamin at all, but, instead, the Christian, Dr. Benjamin Walter, whose body was buried accordingly in a Catholic graveyard.\n\n[11] On September 25, Walter Benjamin had crossed the border with a small group of refugees by an old smuggler's path, only to discover as Brodersen tells us, that \"their transit visas for Spain, which had been valid until then, had been made null and void overnight on the orders of the government, and that all...

Implications for the latent structure of emotional dysregulation\nAuthor(s):Sprague, Jenessa\nDirector of Research:Verona, Edelyn\nDoctoral Committee Chair(s):Verona, Edelyn\nDoctoral Committee Member(s):Allen, Nicole E.; Heller, Wendy; Roberts, Brent W.; Miller, Gregory A.\nDepartment \/ Program:Psychology\nDegree Granting Institution:University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nBorderline Personality Disorder\nEmotion Dysregulation\nAbstract:Although research supports the existence of primary and secondary psychopathy variants in men, little work has examined psychopathy variants in women. Research on gender differences is important, as evidence suggests that the interaction of the interpersonal-affective (F1) and impulsive-antisocial (F2) features of psychopathy is associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD) in women. This has prompted some theorists to propose that secondary psychopathy actually represents a female manifestation of BPD among women. However, empirical research in this area is lacking. Towards this end, the current project sought to achieve three goals using archival data collected across three different studies. These studies examined whether BPD, as well as the emotional dysregulation associated with the disorder, manifests in terms of secondary psychopathy in women. First, Studies 1 and 2 tested the hypothesis that the interaction of the two psychopathy factors is associated with BPD in women (Goal #1). Across both studies, results indicated that the interaction of F1 and F2 traits was associated with BPD in women; this association was found to be specific to women in Study 1. Second, the current investigation moved beyond the BPD diagnosis in order to clarify how the underlying pathology associated with the disorder (i.e., emotional dysregulation) relates to psychopathy across genders (Goal #2). Before this could be accomplished, Study 3 evaluated four competing models of emotional dysregulation in men versus women \u2013 (1) a two-factor hierarchical model; (2) a developmental model; (3) a two-factor model; and (4) a one-factor model. Analyses revealed that emotional dysregulation is best represented by a one-factor model and, moreover, that this model demonstrates at least partial measurement invariance across genders. Supplementary analyses further clarified how the one-factor model relates to existing internalizing and externalizing dimensions of psychopathology. Lastly, Study 3 determined whether the aforementioned relationship between the psychopathy factors and BPD in women is generalizable to the broader construct of emotional dysregulation. Namely, Study 3 examined whether the one-factor model of emotional dysregulation established per Goal 2 phenotypically manifests in terms of secondary psychopathy in women versus men (Goal #3). Similar to the findings of Goal #1, results indicated that the interaction of F1 and F2 psychopathy scores is associated with emotional dysregulation among women, but not men. This observed association between psychopathy and emotional dysregulation was also not accounted for by a history of childhood abuse. The findings of the current project are important for informing work on dimensional conceptualizations of personality psychopathology, moving towards more empirically-derived psychopathology constructs, and refining how their manifestations are understood across genders.\nIssue Date:2013-08-22\nRights Information:Copyright 2013 Jenessa Sprague\nDate Available in IDEALS:2013-08-22\nDate Deposited:2013-08\n\nThis item appears in the following Collection(s)\n\nItem Statistics",
