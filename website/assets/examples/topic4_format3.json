Recent changes make it even better. The program now pays the cost of some preparatory courses for college and graduate school entrance exams. Also, eligibility has been expanded to some officer training school graduates and surviving spouses.\u00a0 The education benefit provides many military men and women with education opportunities that otherwise might not be available.\n\n  \u2022 The Post-9\/11 GI Bill\n  \u2022 Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty (MGIB-AD)\n  \u2022 Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR)\n  \u2022 Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) Veterans Educational Assistance Program\n  \u2022 \u00a0(VEAP) Educational Assistance Test Program (Section 901)\n  \u2022 Survivors\u2019 and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA)\n  \u2022 National Call to Service Program\n  \u2022 Veterans Retraining Assistance Program\n\nFor more information about the program you are interested in\u00a0visit the VA education resource.\n\nVA Work\/Study Program\n\u00a0If you've ever had the need to visit or call one of our offices, you may have been assisted by a veteran working for us through the Veteran Affairs Education Program.
