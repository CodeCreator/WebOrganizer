        "text":"- The Washington Times - Thursday, April 5, 2001\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. Mike Bickle is a man with an idea whose time may have finally come.\n\nIn 1999, he left his job as senior pastor of a 3,000-member church in Grandview, Mo., to set up an \"International House of Prayer\" where 12 teams of people pray around the clock for the world.\n\nHe's since attracted 150 people to relocate there to work on subsistence salaries. Dozens more are lining up to come, and 5,000 to 10,000 visitors are pouring in from around the world each year.\n\n\"The Lord has told us thousands are coming,\" he says. \"But we don't want them to stay here. We want to train them and send them out.\"\n\nHe's thinking big 100,000 IHOP \"missionaries\" tied to 100 prayer centers around the world. There are already start-ups in Dallas; San Diego; Colorado Springs; Chicago; and Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWhen the ministry planned a recent conference in downtown Kansas City for 1,500, more than 3,000 people registered, forcing organizers to relocate the venue to the much larger Bartle Hall. Many of the participants were young, single people looking for a more challenging Christianity. IHOP's Web site (www.ihopkc.com) offers 10-month internships to equip Gen Xers with \"extravagant devotion to Jesus.\"\n\nSome of them had already moved to Kansas City to join Mr. Bickle's experiment. Formerly a missionary in Poona, India, Leasa Young, 33, was captivated by the idea of praying for more than 4 billion of the world's non-Christians in a setting that emphasized massive doses of worship music and prayer.\n\nHer supporters were not as amused. When she switched to IHOP, she lost all except $50 of their monthly donations.\n\n\"I really believe this is what [God] called me to for this season of my life,\" she says. \"It's an adventure as to where the money will come from.\"\n\nAfter paying all her bills in February, she had $3.43 left.\n\nNed Keitt, 27, of Fairfax, Va., says he only has 20 percent of the money he needs each month. He stays with a family to make ends meet.\n\nMr. Bickle, 45, founded the International House of Prayer on May 7, 1999, on a start-it-and-they-will-come model. During the previous 17 years, he had pastored Metro Christian Fellowship in Grandview, 20 miles south of Kansas City. But IHOP (which has no relation to the famous pancake restaurant chain with the same acronym) had been on his mind for nearly 20 years.\n\nDrawing from the Old Testament model of a 24-hour-a-day temple set aside for the worship of God, Mr. Bickle tried to recreate a 21st-century version where there would be continuous prayer.\n\nThe actual site is an unimposing one-story building. The main prayer room is covered with green carpet and ringed with international flags. Three rows of desks ring the perimeter, allowing people to simply observe or take notes. Boxes of tissues are scattered about, as are several pillows on the floor.\n\nBooks lie on the desks, listing various nations and ways to pray for future Christian evangelistic efforts. One corner of the room is filled with children's drawings and a desk with art supplies for anyone so inspired to draw right then and there. A banner at the front of the room proclaims a verse from Leviticus 6:12: \"The fire on the altar shall never go out.\"\n\nA white board to one side lists prayer requests from around the world, ranging from persecution of Sudanese Christians to an Argentinian pastor whose 9-year-old son has drowned.\n\nA large map is on another wall. On yet another is a painting of an agonized Jesus, underneath which is an altar with electric candles and a do-it-yourself Communion set. Pieces of bread and grape juice sit at the ready.\n\nOf the 150 people on staff at IHOP, all raise financial support from friends and home churches so they can serve on one of the 12 prayer teams. The roughest shift, they report, is from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.\n\nThey also help out with administrative tasks and spend at least 12 hours a week in some kind of ministry to the poor.\n\nThe secret of IHOP, Mr. Bickle says, is fascination with the \"beauty\" of God. He has numerous teachings on the topic and writes a magazine column on ways to enjoy the Almighty. His latest book, \"The Pleasures of Loving God,\" exhorts the believer to actually see God as delighting in the personality and quirks of each individual.\n\nWorship and prayer at IHOP is based on this concept. Pre-assigned verses from the biblical books of Revelation or the Song of Songs, which emphasizes God's love for the individual, are placed about the room.\n\nThe worship leaders usually a multipiece band including a guitarist, pianist and drummer, along with some vocalists, sit on a dais backed by gold, green and red draperies.\n\nFacing them are congregants around the room who are sitting, standing, kneeling or prostrate, apparently lost in worship. Like a jazz composition, the singers seem to make up their own tunes or sing whatever prayers or Scriptures have come to mind.\n\nIn one session, \"May this be the day, this be the hour Kansas City is changed by You,\" the drummer sings.\n\nThen the group switches to a chant from one of the psalms. The sessions have a timeless quality to them.\n\nOccasionally, Mr. Bickle leads the worship, especially during Saturday night \"bridegroom prayer watch\" sessions geared toward anticipating the Second Coming. Central to his ministry is what he terms a \"simple lifestyle\" that includes frequent days of fasting.\n\n\"I have lived in simplicity all my adult life and love it,\" he says, adding he gives away hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual income from his books and tapes. He and his wife live in a nearby duplex and he raises about $35,000 as an annual salary from friends and supporters. Those earnings, he says, are supplemented by his wife's earnings as a real estate agent.\n\n\"I want to live as minimally as possible,\" he says, \"to give more away.\"\n\nUnlike most of his fellow nondenominational charismatic pastors, Mr. Bickle has dipped into Catholic spirituality to fill his well. IHOP conference book tables include tomes on the mystics and the Song of Solomon published by Tan Books, a conservative Catholic publisher out of Rockford, Ill.; Teresa of Avila's \"Way of Perfection,\" books by Jesuit priest Thomas Green on spiritual direction and works by Trappist priest Thomas Merton and Henri Nouwen on desert spirituality and contemplative prayer.\n\n\"A lot of us Protestants are unaware of the deeper life writers in the Catholic Church,\" Mr. Bickle says. \"We don't have fiery spirits. There's dogma in the Catholic Church I don't receive. But there are fiery spirits there I do receive.\"\n\nOne of his favorite authors is the Rev. Thomas Dubay, a Catholic priest who writes on prayer.\n\n\"I admire many people, but few inspire me,\" he said. \"But I'm deeply inspired by his writings.\"\n\nNot every visitor agrees or even likes his house of prayer concept, he says, but unusual, even radical means are needed to change the spiritual landscape of the planet.\n\n\"I am creating the paradigm, not the application,\" he says. \"There are people who want to see someone raising the flag.\"\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

He sent us these photos and account of his experience.\n\nAfter arriving at the church in Las Varas, I discovered I would be welding and building eight iron thrusts for their tin roof that were 51 feet long and 4 feet high. We welded two of them together to make four thrusts. I haven\u2019t welded since high school and I\u2019m way over 50. My FFA teacher would have been proud of me.\n\nWe had two arc welders, one wire welder and two gas cement mixers. Some of the team (29 people) had built the cement block church, 50 feet by 70 feet, two years ago and our crew finished it in four days.\n\nWe used a blue 6600 Ford tractor with a pecan front-end loader to lift the thrusts in place 24-feet high. We had to take off the loader to get the tractor through the door and then reassemble it. It almost didn\u2019t have enough weights on the back. We\u2019re so disappointed that we didn\u2019t have time to put on the tin.\n\nWe also had a medical tent one day. We gave some money to the pastor to give to the funeral home for a mother living next to the church who had lost her teenage son in a car wreck the morning we arrived.\n\nThey had church three nights and they really got excited singing for Jesus! Children sat on the front pews. Teenagers were playing a guitar, drums and a keyboard. The pastor was playing guitar and an older man sang and played the accordion. An older man who was healed of blindness two years ago was there every night. Three were saved on the last night, including the mother who just lost her son.\n\nRecommended Stories For You\n\nI didn\u2019t get sick and no one got hurt!\n\nStaff reports",

The statement makes explicit reference to articles published in the local media, containing hints of the possible resignation of the Patriarch, and reprimands media representatives to publish news only after checking the reliability.\nFrom 21 to 23 February, the Patriarch and the Greek-Melkite bishops had gathered in the Synodal Assembly at the Patriarchal See of Rabou\u00e9, in Lebanon. At the end of the Assembly, a statement had been released in which the Patriarch and the Bishops had officially recognized their mistakes that led, in June 2016, to the cancellation of the previous synodal Assembly. On that occasion (see Fides 22\/06\/2016), the Synod of the Greek-Melkite Catholic Church, after having opened on June 20 in Ain Traz in a climate of high tension, was interrupted and postponed due to the absence of a number of bishops. The issue had highlighted the divisions within the Greek-Melkite episcopate, which became increasingly concrete in the request for the resignation of Patriarch Gregoire III, supported by a group of at least ten Bishops. Then, in a following pronouncement of the postponement of the Synod, Patriarch Gr\u00e8goire had remarked that the canon law of the Eastern Catholic Churches does not provide for the possibility of forcing the Patriarch's resignation against his will.

        "text":"The number of young Irish men being ordinated to the priesthood in Ireland has dropped below competing figures in England and Wales for the first time in living memory.\n\nThe plummeting number of vocations are a dramatic departure for a country that once used to export Catholic missionaries globally and provided Britain with a significant proportion of its priests.\n\nNew figures released by the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Ireland this week show that just 16 men are due to start training for the priesthood this autumn, less than half the 39 that signed up for the priesthood last year.\n\nIn contrast, back in the 1980's Ireland would regularly draw more than 150 new recruits to the priesthood every year.\n\nIreland\u2019s newfound recruitment problems will be a cause for concern in Rome since it has always been seen by the Vatican as a stronghold of Catholic faith in secular Europe.\n\nOver the last two decades, the Irish Catholic church\u2019s reputation has been damaged by a series of widespread child sex abuse scandals and by the revelations that senior church officials deliberately covered up the crimes of paedophiles priests.\n\nThis year there are a total of 99 men training for priesthood in Irish seminaries compared with 150 in England and Wales.\n\n\"The recent difficulties with Church scandals mean that those thinking tentatively about priesthood, are not going to be launching themselves forward,\" Father Patrick Rushe, National Coordinator of Diocesan Vocations Directors in Ireland he told the Irish press. \"This has been a difficult year for the Church and is bound to have an effect on numbers.\"\n\nBut Father Rushe suggested that the numbers this year were a \"blip\" and should return to a more steady level of 25 or 26 new vocations in the years to come.\n\nThe true extent of the crisis was revealed in 2008 when the Irish church admitted that 160 priests had died that year with only nine new ordinations.\n\nFigures for Irish nuns were even more dramatic, with the deaths of 228 nuns and only two taking final vows for service in religious life last year.",

        "text":"Home - VIS Vatican - Receive VIS - Contact us - Calendar\n\nThe Vatican Information Service is a news service, founded in the Holy See Press Office, that provides information about the Magisterium and the pastoral activities of the Holy Father and the Roman Curia...[]\n\nLast 5 news\n\nVISnews in Twitter Go to YouTube\n\nThursday, January 31, 2013\n\n\nVatican City, 31 January 2013 (VIS) \u2013 The annual Plenary Assembly of the Pontifical Council for Culture was presented in a conference this morning in the Press Office of the Holy See. This year's plenary will be dedicated to the theme \"Emerging Youth Cultures\" and will take place from 6 to 9 February. Participating in the conference were Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi and Bishop Carlos Alberto de Pinho Moreira Azevedo, respectively president and delegate of that dicastery, along with Fr. Enzo Fortunato, O.F.M. Conv., director of the Sacred Convent of Saint Francis Press Office in Assisi and two youth representatives: Alessio Antonielli of Italy and Farasoa Mihaja Bemahazaka of Madagascar.\n\nIn an address presenting the event that was given a few days ago at the Convent of St. Francis in Assisi, Cardinal Ravasi said that its main area of interest would be \"youth culture\". \"Walking down the streets with their ears blocked up with earphones, listening to their music, gives a sign that they are 'disconnected' from the unbearable social, political, and religious complexities that we adults have created. In a certain sense, they drop their gaze so as to exclude themselves because we have excluded them with our corruption and inconsistency, with uncertainty, unemployment, and marginalization. We parents, teachers, and priests, the ruling class, we must examine our conscience. The 'diversity' of youth, which in fact is not only negative, contains surprising seeds of fruitfulness and authenticity. We need only think of the choice to volunteer made by many young persons or their passion for music, sports, and friendship, which is their ways of telling us that man does not live by bread alone. We need only think of their spirituality, which is so original in its sincerity, or their freedom, which is hidden under a blanket of seeming indifference.\"\n\n\"For these and for many other reasons,\" concluded the president of the Pontifical Council for Culture, \"I am interested in the youth, who are the present (not only the future) of humanity. Of the five billion people living in developing countries, more than half are under the age of 25 (representing 85% of all the youth in the world). That is why, leaving aside the ever-necessary objective socio-psychological analysis of faith on the young, that is, the meaning of religious presence to them, we would rather focus on their faith, that is, trusting in their possibilities, even if they are buried underneath those differences that, at first glance, cause such an striking impression.\"\n\nBishop Avezedo, during his address at the press conference, laid out the plenary's program, clarifying that its objective is \"to objectively enquire into the new, complex, and fragmented phenomenon of youth cultures with the help of experts and listening to the thoughts of the members and consultors of the Pontifical Council for Culture. Only the opening ceremony will be open to the public. It will be held in the Aula Magna of the LUMSA University and will have the novelty of a short rock concert preceding the first conference. The work document sent to all participants clarifies our perspective of cultural analysis of the transformations in adolescents and young adults who are questioning the practices of evangelisation.\"\n\n\"A few days ago,\" he commented, \"the International Labour Organization said that 73.8 million young persons in the world are seeking employment and that there will be half a million more by 2014. This information raises a series of questions: Is there a distrust of government? Is there a fear of the future? Will the youth take to the streets in protest? Does the myth of eternal youth reveal a lack of value of adults?\" In this context, and after the assembly takes an overall look at the situation, the program will focus on some of the most salient and wide-reaching cultural features such as how the \"digital culture revolutionizes the model and the grammar of communications\". The structures and rituals of this language, just like the importance of music, meeting places, etc. \u2026 All those questions that \"require discernment on the part of the Church and a profound change in language and the creation of codes in which the Christian vision might be meaningful.\" Other topics for discussion will be the \"emotional alphabet\" of the youth, the value of the body, friendship networks, and the delay in attaining self-sufficiency.\n\nThe following day, three young adults from different continents will reflect on the reasons for having confidence in the youth. Despite the fear of the future and the worsening of economic conditions, there are \"potentials, an incredible creativity, a spirit of volunteering that is full of altruism, \u2026 and answers to the questions of meaning and hope.\"\n\nThe next topic to be dealt with will be that of \"generating the faith, which we have called the 'cultural battle'. Effectively,\" Bishop Avezedo said, \"that means that creating conditions that make meeting Christ possible have to have a cultural as well as a pastoral and theological focus. The fatigue, and at times failure, of ecclesial practices that widen the gap between young persons and the Church needs to be understood. Also, the rates of being born into the faith are low. Adult generations either do not know how or do not have time to deal with their own faith or to generate the faith in their children.\"\n\n\"The audience with the Holy Father at the beginning of the plenary meeting will be a major incentive for the assembly. For 2,000 years, the Church hasn't had a predetermined artistic style or a predefined language. She looks to the person and the message of Jesus to communicate in these totally 'multi-verse' times. Emerging youth cultures reveal the vulnerability, the insecurity, and the fragility of repetitive formulas. The Pontifical Council for Culture's promising assembly frees us from superficiality and apathy and is unafraid of confronting the truth of cultural situations.\"\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nCopyright \u00a9 VIS - Vatican Information Service",
