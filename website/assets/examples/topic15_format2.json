        "text":"Brett Hetherington\n\nBanner photos: Cornelia Kraft\n\nPortrait of an Asturian miner\n\n\u00a0[This article was first published in Catalonia Today magazine, December 2016.]\n\nThe coal miner's wife wakes him and he coughs. He shuffles to the small bathroom sink and spits black liquid, washing it away with with the brown tap water.\n\nLast night he slept badly, suffering from stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting again. He had been working in the zinc mine at Arnao in Castrillon but the Belgian company who own the site have let him go to the San Juan mine. He felt himself to be quite lucky. At least there they had a river pool for the miners to wash in.\n\nAs he leaves for another day under the earth the miner looks for a last time at the mountains, at their ferns and the tall groups of eucalyptus - \u2013 pencil thin, not quite straight, just like the trees in a Dr Seuss book. He sees the houses with their sharp pitched roofs in front of deep gorges and is comforted by the roll of the hills across this green land.\n\nOur miner is living before the era of the chemical plants and big metal factories. He knows others who dig for iron and knows it\u2019s vital for tinned food because electricity and refrigeration have not yet arrived to this part of the world.\n\nHis mine, like many mines, is close to a river: a means of transporting the coal for trading this raw material with British towns like Cardiff and Newcastle-upon-Tyne [where my own father was born and also grew up next to a polluted river.]\n\nThis miner's children will one day see the construction of chemical industries, thanks to the mines, thanks to his labour. In fact, he thinks, as he makes the walk to the pits, the story of Asturias is the story of the miner and the story of the miner is the story of Asturias. It is one of hardship and scant reward, of growth but also ill health. It is a tale of the deep earth's hidden secrets and humanity\u2019s immeasurable suffering with the open spaces of the valleys and their claustrophobic confines - as unforgiving and back-breaking as any imagined hell in those greedy shafts penetrating ever downwards into the planet.\n\nToday, like thousands of other days, he will launch his body into the ground and probe for hour after hour for that black rock. Finally, at the end of the day our miner will take aspirin for his aching bones, smiling at the ironic fact that it has ingredients made from the very coal he has been digging for. He does not yet know though that, decades later, his children are going eat kiwi-fruits and chestnuts that will come to grow particularly well in the carbon-coloured soil left from abandoned open-cut mines scattered across the nearby hills.\n\nAs the miner eats his simple lunch with his hands still blackened by coal dust, he remembers his father, who was also a miner. He too worked to extract the iron that was in such high demand for both twentieth century century world wars \u2013 a metal that helped the rich become richer. His father started life as a rural worker and had to adapt from the rhythms of the seasons to the very different rhythm of an industrial timetable. He had to learn to accept days and nights with no sky or trees, down in the mines which lay right next to his cramped terrace house.\n\nLike every other subterranean labourer, his father and he both wondered if life could ever be different for them. He\u2019d heard that things were a bit better at the only mine run by a trade union. But it was on the other side of Asturias and he had never even visited there.\n\nOur miner lives in Bustiello town where all of the aristocrat Marques de Camilla's workers have their neat little houses below everyone else, at the bottom of the valley. It is an orderly, rectangular village and each house has a small garden. Up the hill above them live the engineers and above them is the church, then God of course. This is what he knows: the planning of the town exactly reflects the social and spiritual hierarchy. The Marques is a conservative man. He fears the progressive men who want social change.\n\nFurther on in the mountains there are mining zones that suffered from \u201cspecial measures\u201d during Franco's dictatorship. Around Pozo Fortuna trade union activists were assassinated and their bodies were thrown down an old pit-hole. Our miner speaks about this sadly with his friends and later falls asleep hoping that the bad times will end.\n\nIn the morning, he rises and faces another day.",

        "text":"Eric\u2019s phone call to his boss went about as well as his visit to Patrick\u2019s office. The young engineer knew his A-game hadn\u2019t been good enough and was still reeling from getting checked by Purchasing. \u201cPick yourself up off the ice and get back to work,\u201d Eric\u2019s boss said. \u201cGo talk to that company Elasto Proxy and get some answers to Patrick\u2019s questions. Otherwise, you can forget about switching vendors.\u201d\n\nWith a cup of coffee in one hand, Eric dialed Jenny-Lynn, his Elasto Proxy solutions provider. She picked up on the first ring and could tell by Eric\u2019s voice that the young engineer had been through the wringer. Eric explained that he needed gasket prices and minimum order quantities (MOQs). Then he took another sip of coffee, paused, and asked if buying a gasket was really just about knowing these two numbers.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Jenny-Lynn told the engineer. \u201cPrice and MOQ matter, of course, but your company also needs to think about true costs and manufacturing waste, especially with all of the rework you\u2019ve been doing. Has anyone spoken to you about this before?\u201d Eric couldn\u2019t remember learning about this in any of his engineering classes, and price rather than true costs was his company cared about.\n\n\u201cTrue costs are the full scope of your manufacturing costs,\u201d Jenny-Lynn explained. \u201cLet\u2019s keep things simple and stick to labor and materials. Labor is not just about the labor cost of the installer. It includes the cost of ordering, receiving, inventorying, and then delivering gaskets to the assembly line. There\u2019s even a cost to maintaining vendors and inspecting the quality of gasket installation.\u201d\n\nEric took another sip of coffee and asked Jenny-Lynn to continue.\n\n\u201cWith your material costs,\u201d she added, \u201cit\u2019s not just about installation either. Your true costs include material waste, such as when an installer makes a mis-cut and then discards a length of rubber. Here, it\u2019s worth talking about MOQs \u2013 something you mentioned before. Buying more material than you need isn\u2019t a good business strategy,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for sure,\u201d Eric agreed. \u201cWhen I met with our Purchasing Director, he told me he didn\u2019t want a bunch of excess stock laying around because it ties up cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else did say to you?\u201d, Jenny-Lynn asked. \u201cI think it would help to know all of his concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Eric continued, \u201che got pretty upset about stock-outs. It wasn\u2019t even the gaskets that bothered him, but all of the other rubber and plastic parts that he can\u2019t get.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Jenny-Lynn said. \u201cIt sounds like your Purchasing Director has some real headaches. Did he mention any of the eight forms of manufacturing waste? They\u2019re transportation, inventory, motion, waiting, over-production, over-processing, defects, and unused knowledge\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhoah,\u201d Eric laughed. \u201cI liked it better when you talked about true costs and how they relate to labor and materials. This is all new to me. Still, manufacturing waste does seem like something that Patrick our Purchasing Director would understand. He\u2019s the kind of guy who keeps aframed business school diploma on his wall.\u201d \u00a0\n\nNow it was Jenny-Lynn\u2019s turn to laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a B-school grad to understand this stuff. It still comes down to labor, materials, and manufacturing overhead \u2013 if it\u2019s OK to introduce another term\u201d.\n\nPatrick said that it was and asked her to continue.\n\n\u201cWith some numbers from your Operations Manager,\u201d Jenny-Lynn continued, \u201c I bet you could convince Patrick to look at your company\u2019s true costs because he seems like a guy who doesn\u2019t like manufacturing waste \u2013 even though he\u2019s part of the manufacturing overhead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that Patrick likes much of anything,\u201d Eric quipped.\n\nThey both laughed.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Jenny-Lynn continued, \u201cI\u2019m willing to work with you on getting the information that you need from Operations. Would you commit to setting up a meeting with your Operations Manager and inviting me to it? We can do a video call \u2013 it\u2019s something we do a lot at Elasto Proxy.\u201d\n\nEric put down his coffee cup and smiled.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll set up a video call with Olivia. She\u2019s our Operations Manager \u2013 a tough lady, but also fun to work with.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nPrevious Chapters\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Hip Checked\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Game Plan\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Thin Ice\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLeave a Reply",
