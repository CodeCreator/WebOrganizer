        "text":"Tuesday, August 2, 2016\n\nJohn Graves Simcoe's Weird & Complicated Relationship With Slavery\n\nAugust 1 was both Simcoe Day and Emancipation Day in the City of Toronto. One is meant to remember the British soldier who founded our city; the other marks the day slavery was abolished across the entire British Empire. It's an interesting overlap: Simcoe was responsible for abolishing slavery in Toronto; he passed the first law to end the practice ever passed anywhere in the Empire. But his relationship to slavery wasn't anywhere near as clear-cut and simple as that might make it sound. And so, to mark this year's Simcoe and Emancipation Days, I thought I'd do some tweeting.\n\nYou'll find the Twitter essay embedded below.

        "text":"Engineers of Victory by Paul\u00a0Kennedy\n\nThis book was certainly an interesting surprise. \u00a0I was expecting something more specific about equipment and weapons development during the Second World War. \u00a0The subtitle is about \u201cProblem Solvers\u201d. \u00a0It might have been better called something like \u201cHow Things got Done\u201d; or a \u201ccelebration of mid-level leaders\u201d.\n\nThe 370 pages of text are broken into five lengthy chapters examining different critical campaigns from January 1943 to July 1944, and looking at the nuts and bolts of how they were won by the allies. \u00a0It certainly isn\u2019t a narrative history, more of a deep analysis. \u00a0And that may be the very thing that kept it interesting for someone who has read far more on this period of time than I can even remember. \u00a0The five campaigns, or specific challenges, dealt with here are The Battle of the Atlantic, Winning Air Superiority over Western Europe, Stopping the Wehrmacht, Amphibious Operations in Europe and Conquering the Vast Distances of the Pacific.\n\nIn each of these chapters the author weaves together all the details, the complexity, the interconnectedness of things needed to make things work. \u00a0I found that fascinating from beginning to end. \u00a0It is so often true when we read campaign or battle histories we come up short on greater context, but this book provides context in abundance and helps us keep track of how all the details come together. Whether its the cavity magnetron, T-34 testing at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, mating the Merlin to the Mustang or ambhibious theory by Pete Ellis; there is just a staggering level of stuff\u00a0here. \u00a0As is so often the case with \u201cbig picture\u201d stories like this there are several detail errors on little things, naturally I most notice it on aircraft but I\u2019m sure other readers will have some other little nits to pick. \u00a0But it really is just in the little stuff I have some complaints.\n\nFascinating and fun book.\n\n~ Dave\u00a0\n\n\nAbout atcDave\n\nI'm 54 years old and live in Ypsilanti, Michigan. I'm happily married to Jodie. I've been an air traffic controller for 31 years; grew up in the Chicago area, and am still a fanatic for pizza and the Chicago Bears. My main interest is military history, and my related hobbies include scale model building and strategy games.\nThis entry was posted in Book Reviews and tagged , .

I always enjoy a book with a new angle on what you think are well known historical events.\n\n  2. Sounds good, I tend to enjoy the technical and factual books and an analysis of these events is always an interesting read.\n\n  3. Ernie Davis says:\n\n    I\u2019ve never followed the history of the pacific as much as Europe, but I have always thought that the staggering scale of the Pacific war and the logistics of how to support it was something I needed to look in to at some point.\n\n    \u2022 atcDave says:\n\n      Yeah the Pacific has a very different dynamic to it. In terms of fighting men and weapons it was a much smaller war, at least until about mid \u201944. But the logistics of it are staggering; and more than anything else that was the decisive factor. I\u2019ve always loved it as a war gamer; having to pick fights all about distances, supplies, routes\u2026\n      I would normally hesitate to recommend an analytical type history before a good narrative one; but the writer here does a great job of dealing with the scope of it all. And that may actually make it a terrific introduction.\n\n    \u2022 Ernie Davis says:\n\n      I do have a pretty good general knowledge of the narrative history of the Pacific theaters (Except CBI is still pretty much a mystery outside \u201cBridge on the River Kwai or Flying Tigers\u201d). I am aware of the major sea and land battles and their consequences. I may give it a try while on vacation.\n\n      \u2022 atcDave says:\n\n        Cool. Let me know if you have any other thoughts on it. Unless, you know, you think I\u2019m a total idiot for liking the book. Keep that to yourself.\n        CBI is interesting, even if not much is written about it. The period covered here was mostly stagnant though. But one thing, many analysts consider William Slim the best British general of WWII and he fought in the CBI.\n\n      \u2022 Ernie Davis says:\n\n        It has always struck me, and I may have said it before, that by 1941 China had ground to a stalemate for Japan, and aside from the burst of post Pearl Harbor in the Burma and India parts of that theater, it remained so for the majority of the war. Plenty of brutal fighting and heroic efforts to break the stalemate mind you, and some very brave and innovative efforts to break the supply chain problems, but it seems to me everyone was pretty much stuck with their situation and what they had as resources by early 1942.\n\n      \u2022 atcDave says:\n\n        There were campaigns and movement. It was actually alarming how, in China, Japan was able to wage effective offensives almost the end. There were significant operations, including regular and irregular, in India and Burma too. But it was significantly a backwater and an area of some dispute between Americans and British (Churchill was worried about \u201cEmpire\u201d, which FDR did not want anything to do with; while Americans were more interested in China which the British considered hopeless and corrupt).\n        And hey, it\u2019s the one place where M3 Grant\/Lee tanks were in use to the end of the war.\n\n      \u2022 Ernie Davis says:\n\n        Just to let you know, I got it and as I near the end of the Battle of the Atlantic, I\u2019m pretty impressed. Only drawback was the slight snarkiness about those who bought the Bletchley Park meme that make for a far better movie than a realization that 4 escorts and prayer won\u2019t protect a convoy.\n\n      \u2022 atcDave says:\n\n        He does get snarky at times!\n        I think his main objection, on several levels, is towards those who push one issue as the thing that won the war. And there have been several such claims about Ultra in recent years.\n        And a lot of that is just typical with academics, kind of a snarky group.\n\n        I\u2019m glad you\u2019re liking it so far!\n\n      \u2022 Ernie Davis says:\n\n        No, I get it, he has a point. A couple of Canadian Aircraft mechanics adding an extra fuel tank to a B24 contributed just as much to that eventual victory, as did the change in doctrine and improved radars. Just thought it could have been done with a more generous tone for those of us who don\u2019t read original source material for fun.\n\n      \u2022 atcDave says:\n\n        Yeah I do agree about that.\n\n      \u2022 Ernie Davis says:\n\n        I do love books that break a few myths. One of my favorites was that RAF pilots wore silk scarves out of some sort of vanity, when in fact it was just because they had to have their heads on a constant swivel, and their woolen uniforms chafed their necks.\n\n      \u2022 atcDave says:\n\n        Or that Sherman tanks just explode as soon as they see a panzer\u2026\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Thursday, 12 November 2009\n\nHistorical References\n\nOne of the chief sources of inspiration in my storytelling is history -- our history (as in RL, doofus). Now, as it happens, I'm a history-buff, reading one book after another about ancient wars, collapsing empires, and the customs of people long dead. One of the drawbacks is that when I toss out a reference, say, \"The man is dressed in a\u00a0slightly\u00a0old-fashioned manner; picture a late 16th Century Englishman,\" it may not\u00a0necessarily\u00a0be universally informative...\n\nSo, in the interest of public education, I have come up with a new column: Historical References. Here I'll scour the intertubes for pictures and articles of era-specific relevance.\n\nSo, without further ado...\n\nHistorical References I\n\nPortrait of Abel Tasman, His Wife and Daughter\nAttributed to Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp\u00a0(1594\u20131651)\nPicture hosted by: the National Library of Australia\n\nThe portrait is of a Dutch explorer, in fact the first European to find Tasmania and New Zealand. This is a nice example of the style of a Wezellian family.\n\nSoldier of the\u00a0Carignan-Salieres Regiment\nFrancis Back\n\nThis fellow represents a typical Erian infantryman. Uniforms are not widely used by armies, instead using colored cloth tied around an arm, a flower in the hat, or any number of similar improvised ways of signalling uniformity. Note that certain prestigious units, like royal guards, use uniforms. One important distinction is that the picture displays a matchlock musket. Most kingdoms now use flintlock muskets, or even the expensive flintlock rifles.\n\nPicture by:\u00a0Swords and Armor\n\nAnother trusty companion of all soldiers and adventurers is the sword. In the world of Argos, the swords in use are not typically the huge blades of Conan or Strider, but the slightly more\u00a0sophisticated\u00a0basket-hilted\u00a0Renaissance\u00a0blade. Of course, the true gentleman will arm himself with a musketeer-style blade akin to that on the above picture.\n\n\u00a0The Peasant Meal\nLe Nain Brothers\nPicture hosted by:\u00a0\n\nAnd this romantic scene offers a glimpse into the life of the average working stiff. Even in a roleplaying world, not everyone leads a life of daring adventures.\n\nThe awesome Wikipedia has a nice article on era-relevant fashion. This is a good general introduction to the mainstream fashion of Eria, and it also explains a few slightly foreign articles of clothing, like the doublet\u00a0and other items not commonly found in most contemporary wardrobes.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a comment",

        "text":"Thursday, November 16, 2006\n\nLord Jim\n\nThe classic English sea novel, Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad was 'required reading' in English Literature class aboard my pre-sea cadet training ship many years ago. It was a moving story of an idealistic seaman forced to deal with his act of cowardice and how he ultimately redeems himself. He had abandoned a ship and left the passengers to die. This book was later made into an excellent movie in 1965 starring Peter O'Toole and James Mason.\n\nI didnt even know it was adapted from a true maritime incident involving an early local kapal haji, the S.S. Jeddah until I read the book review below recently. The heroic tale of our jemaah haji overcoming the odds in the face of adversity is forever lost in time and will never be told. It would have made for an interesting, if not truly inspiring reading. Our own great great grandparents could have been on that ship.\n\nBut how times have changed, eh?\n\nPS: The italics and text colouring are mine.\n\n(Movie poster from IMDb Photo Gallery)\n\nAnd you, what are you doing here?\n\nMichael Gilsenan\n\nA Season in Mecca: Narrative of a Pilgrimage by Abdellah Hammoudi ed. Pascale Ghazaleh \u00b7 Polity, 293 pp, \u00a312.99\n\nThe Jeddah sailed from Singapore on 17 July 1880, bound for Penang and Jeddah, with 778 men, 147 women and 67 children on board. Muslims from the Malay Archipelago, they were traveling to Mecca and Medina for the pilgrimage. Some came from the Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia); some from the different Malay states, then beginning to experience more direct British intervention; some from Singapore.\n\nThe ship was under the British flag. Seyyid Muhammad al-Sagoff, the managing director and part-owner of the Singapore Steamship Company, to which it belonged, came from a wealthy Arab family, originally from Hadhramaut in south-east Yemen but already well established in the economy of Singapore and the Hejaz, the region in western Arabia within which lie the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Seyyid Omar al-Sagoff, Muhammad\u2019s son, was on board. In addition to its Singapore office, the business had an important branch in Jeddah, the main port of the Hejaz, then part of the Ottoman Empire. It also ran an agency in Aden, since its conquest in 1839 a key link in British maritime influence in the Indian Ocean, and after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 an even more important port on the Europe-Asia routes. This is the high point of 19th-century imperialism.\n\nAfter terrible weather conditions in the first week of August, the boilers \u2018started adrift from their seatings\u2019. The Jeddah had for some days been taking in water. Now it sprang a heavy leak. The water rose rapidly. The captain and the European officers abandoned the settling and heavily listing ship, taking Seyyid Omar with them, and were picked up by another vessel and taken to Aden, where they told a story of violent passengers and a foundering ship. The pilgrims were left to their fate, an apparently certain death.\n\nTo much astonishment, however, given reports of its loss, on 8 August another steamship towed the Jeddah into Aden. The pilgrims had survived. They had been abandoned by those meant to protect them. Official inquiries followed into this great scandal of the sea.\n\nOne element in the case that added to the embarrassment as well as the outrage of the European and seafaring communities concerned the conduct of the pilgrims. The Vice-Admiralty Court in Singapore, meeting in September 1881 to consider the amount of salvage to be paid, found that the pilgrims became agitated only when they realised that they were being left to die by the crew. They had not threatened violence as had been alleged in defence of the decision to abandon them. Indeed, the judgment says, they did not use their knives to injure anyone. The master had communicated nothing to them and their \u2018demeanour\u2019 could be quite reasonably accounted for by the realisation that they were being deserted: the master\u2019s leaving the ship \u2018roused the pilgrims to violence in attempting to swamp his boat, and such the Court consider might naturally have been expected from any body of human beings, even Europeans, situated as the pilgrims were\u2019. Moreover, the Malay pilgrims appeared to have acted with great efficiency when it came to working the pumps to clear the ship of water, desperate work they continued when the Jeddah was under tow by the French vessel that had spotted their distress signals. The colonial stereotype of \u2018the Malay\u2019 as \u2018running amok\u2019 when not being the classical \u2018lazy native\u2019 he was held to be by some British authorities could not have been challenged more strongly.\n\nThe moral reversal - natives behaving properly while being betrayed by white men who violated their own codes of the sea - impressed the inquiry and, no doubt, the devourers of the now fast traveling news between Aden and London and Singapore.\n\nThis was the scandal that inspired Conrad, who had landed in Singapore in 1883 after himself being forced to abandon ship, to write Lord Jim etc., etc.,\n\n1 comment:\n\n  1.

        "text":"In the Scheme of Things: Those Who Came\n\nI was born in Montana, left as a toddler, returning in my fifth decade for a second act career as a writer. It was then I first met and worked with Native Americans. Previously, I hadn\u2019t known anyone who didn\u2019t have an arriving-to-America story in their family history.\n\nWhile many of us have relatives, perhaps generations ago, who made a conscious decision to come to this country, that\u2019s not true for everyone, of course. A few people were already here, some tagged along as children, and others were brought against their will.\n\nAlong my life\u2019s way, growing up in California, attending graduate school in Michigan, raising a family in Pennsylvania, living in the Rocky Mountain states of Montana and Colorado, I\u2019ve heard hundreds of why-we-came stories from people I knew personally.\n\nSome stories are fresh with tears and struggles, others generations old where details have been lost or blurred. But the why seems to remain. On my mother\u2019s side, they came for religious freedom; on my father\u2019s a chance for a better life. Like many immigrant stories, my ancestors arrived with little more than hope, courage, and uncertainty.\n\nA picture sits on my desk to remind me of what it must take to leave behind everyone you love and venture into a strange land where you might not even speak the language. People come here to make a better life, enjoy rights and freedoms, or escape unthinkable hardships.\n\nI found that picture in a tattered, moldy box when cleaning out a shed at my parent\u2019s house. It\u2019s a picture of my great grandfather as a young man of 18 or l9, with three of his brothers. He arrived from Germany in the mid l800s, settling on the plains of South Dakota.\n\nJust as fables and fairy tales help children learn about the world, others\u2019 life stories and struggles help us appreciate who we are as a nation, weaving America\u2019s tapestry with strength, dreams, determination, talent, and diversity.\n\nIn the scheme of things, it seems to me, if we close our hearts to those who seek what my great grandfather sought, or yours, our tapestry of hope, compassion, freedom, and opportunity, woven collectively for centuries by our diverse ancestors \u2014 some legal, some not; some arriving by choice and some not \u2014 begins to unravel. I try to remember this: just two percent of us can claim their family was always here; descendants of the original peoples of these lands.\n\nIn these complex times, I can\u2019t help picturing my elderly mother at the Statue of Liberty. One of the bucket items we helped her cross off after my father died, was a visit to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. She wanted to see what her ancestors saw, touch the ground they touched, and spiritually thank those who came before for creating the life she enjoyed. May that symbol of freedom and hope be a reminder to us of our own immigrant histories, and always be a welcoming light to the world.\n\nSorry, comments and trackbacks have now been closed.",

I was surprised to learn how many of my husband's ancestors were early pioneers in various areas, founding towns and living in some very primitive conditions.\n\n5. I was enlightened to learn how difficult life could be for a new Irish immigrant in this country in the 1850s, and the ethnic prejudice that they had to endure.\n\n6. I was delighted to learn more of my great-grandfather, Justin Meyer J\u00f8rgensen; not only facts about him, but stories and bits of information about him personally, and his part in family dynamics.\u00a0 I thought this information was unattainable, until I met my cousin, Tove, from Norway.\u00a0 Never stop hoping for the details you want so desperately.\n\n7. Learning that my husband's grandparents stowed away on a train, to get where they needed to go, was a startling discovery!\n\n8. Researching my husband's line, which includes numerous physicians, was definitely an education in early medical practices.\u00a0 Yikes!\u00a0 But also reading in old newspapers about how many times Dr. Seeman of Rockham, South Dakota, was summoned for various emergencies, makes me so proud of him.\u00a0 He was a dedicated country doctor.\n\n9.\u00a0 I was surprised to learn that my husband's great-grandmother, Frances Stemper Joyce, delivered so many babies and tended to her sick neighbors, with her own large family to take care of.\n\n10.\u00a0 I was delighted to learn my earliest ancestor \"on this side of the pond\" was here in 1623.\u00a0 It's staggering to comprehend that much elapsed time.\n\nNow - for the blogs I would like to pass the award to.\u00a0 It was really tough to make a decision, as I love to read so many blogs, but here they are, in no particular order:\n\n1. Branching Out Through the Years\n2. Reflections From the Fence\n3. What's Past is Prologue\n4. Those Old Memories\n5. Bits and Pieces\n6. Lessons From My Ancestors\n7. Desperately Seeking Surnames\n8. The Ties That Bind\n9. I Will Remember\n10. Stardust 'n' Roots\n\nThanks again to Evelyn for the award, and thanks to all the bloggers who produce such interesting reading on our favorite topic.\n\n\n  1.
