The 150 pitches (all fully serviced, 4\/10A electricity) are on level grass, some under trees and others in the open by a stream that runs through the site. Wild birds are abundant, including kingfishers. This is the perfect location from which to commence the climb of the Ballon d\u2019Alsace, which is hugely popular with cyclists. Theatre lovers should visit Bussang (6 km) and see the large wooden People\u2019s Theatre, built in 1895 and still performing in July and August every year; you will marvel at the raked stage and the enormous backstage areas which may be visited at any time.\n\nThe site has a special lake for children to fish (stocked by the owner), whereas the adults can visit one of three adjacent lakes just outside. The keen cyclist would enjoy the long distance track which passes the boundary. Those of a slightly different sporting bent, may like to visit the Casino at Bussang (open all year) even if only to partake of a meal and watch.\n\n\nTwo stylish and modern toilet blocks (all season) and two older ones (high season only). Facilities for disabled campers and babies. Laundry. Motorcaravan services. Gas supplies. Bar and takeaway (July\/Aug). Large heated swimming pool with slide and paddling pool (June-Aug). Fishing.

The 151-mile (243-kilometer) drive starts at Torquay and ends at Allansford is a popular daytrip from Melbourne but Hipcampers can make the most of the scenery by slowing down and settling in to some of the great camping sites, from beaches to bush, along the way.\n\nWhere to Go\n\n\nSurfers won\u2019t want to skip Torquay: Next to Bells Beach, it\u2019s famed for its big swells and hosts the world's best surfers at the annual Rip Curl Pro, held around Easter. Those who prefer to stay on dry land can embark upon the 27-mile (44-kilometer) Surf Coast Walk to Airey\u2019s Inlet. A little farther south, Lorne has inviting white-sand beaches and a relaxed atmosphere, and is a great place to see migrating whales between May and September. Powered sites at the centrally located Torquay Holiday Park have access to a heated swimming pool, camp kitchen, and laundry, while, just south of Lorne, Cumberland River Reserve is set in lush surroundings and has unpowered sites with access to hot showers, laundry, and barbecues.\n\nApollo Bay\n\nSet at the foothills of the Otways, the little town of Apollo Bay is a great place to base yourself for embarking on walks into the hinterland and around Great Otway National Park, as well as for exploring the 65-mile (104-kilometer)-long Great Ocean Walk, which starts in Apollo Bay and ends at Gibson Steps near the Twelve Apostles. This is also a great spot for wildlife spotting: Look out for platypus at Lake Elizabeth and koalas around Kennett River Holiday Park, which has powered and unpowered sites with access to laundry, camp kitchen, and barbeques. Just outside Apollo Bay, Marengo Holliday Park is similarly well-equipped, while the more adventurous can find basic hike-in campsites along the Great Ocean Walk, including Johanna\u2019s Beach Campgrounds, tucked behind sand dunes near a popular surfing beach.\n\nTwelve Apostles\n\nThe Great Ocean Road\u2019s star attraction, the seven rocky stacks of the Twelve Apostles jut out from the ocean and can be seen from a network of viewing platforms around the clifftops: Visit around sunset and you might also spot penguins come into shore after a day\u2019s fishing. The closest campsite to the Twelve Apostles, Princetown Recreation Reserve and Camping offers powered and unpowered sites with access to hot showers, laundry, and a barbecue area, as does nearby Apostles Camping Park and Cabins. Twenty minutes east, Port Campbell Recreation Reserve is set in a natural reserve and has powered and unpowered sites with access to hot showers, laundry, barbecues, and free wifi.\n\n\nAt the end of the Great Ocean Road, the attractive city of Warrnambool is famed for its whales, best seen from Logans Beach between June and October. You can also dive into the city\u2019s lively arts scene, discover the history of the Shipwreck Coast at Flagstaff Hill Maritime Village, and admire the historic lighthouses, whitewashed cottages, and maritime charm of nearby Port Fairy. Powered and unpowered sites with access to the camp kitchen, barbecue, laundry, and shower are available at Surfside Holiday Park on Warrnambool\u2019s foreshore, just steps from the popular swimming beach, while nearby family- and pet-friendly Warrnambool Holiday Park and Motel has powered sites, some ensuite, with access to a heated swimming pool, games room, kitchen, laundry, barbecue, and wifi.\n\nHipcamp is created with \u2764\ufe0f and hope for our future.",

        "text":"Thursday, August 9, 2012\n\nA guide to the rejuvenated Radiance Of The Seas\n\nThere are plenty of quality ships for cruise loving holidaymakers to choose from right now and the Radiance Of The Seas is well worth considering. The lead ship of Royal Caribbean's Radiance Class vessels has been radically rejuvenated at considerable expense and is now even more ship-shape than ever it was.\n\nAs a result, the Radiance hosts some of the latest dinning experiences offered on-board any of the world's great cruise ships. And you can't help but be impressed by the enormous nine-storey atrium that sits right in the heart of the ship and provides some really stunning views out to sea.\n\nThe feel on-board these days is one of spaciousness and relaxation. Although there are plenty of activities for passengers to choose from and a huge amount for children to get involved with each and every day.\n\nAmong the most impressive features of the newly refurbished Radiance is the Adventure Ocean element that has all manner of water slides and pools for energetic holidaymakers of all ages to enjoy and have a splash around in. There is also a state-of-the-art gym area, where passengers can have a go at yoga or tai chi, if the impulse takes them. Elsewhere there are sunbeds where the idea is only to take it easy and you can take in a newly released movie on a nearby big screen if you're so inclined.\n\nThere are cut-price deals on cruise holidays aboard the Radiance and a variety of other awe-inspiring Royal Caribbean vessels available online throughout the year. And if you're looking for a bargain deal on an excellent cruise Thomas Cook should perhaps be your first route of inquiry given the array of discounted packages offered by the company. You might just be surprised by how much cruise holiday you can secure for your money.\n\n\nBlog Widget by LinkWithin\n\nWorth Exploring\n\nMommy Chronicles @ Step It Up\n\nCopyright 2009.

From a Canadian perspective, that's more people than ALL of the provinces and territories outside of Ontario and Quebec. In one city. Woah. It literally takes hours to get from one side of the city to the other because of the volume of traffic - by day or by night - it is always \"rush hour\" it would seem.\n\nThe city, formerly known as Constantinople of course, is steeped in more than two thousand years of history, equal in scope and grandeur (though not quite as ancient) to that of Rome, or Athens. The most important trade routes, by sea and by land, between Asia and Europe came through Istanbul, and the ancient Persians, Macedonians, Greeks and Romans all defended it's location in their time, on the strategic Bosphoros Strait. It was a world city well before Prague, London or Paris were anything but villages. Everywhere you look there are historical wonders. At one time, the entire Roman empire was ruled from here, and the great Hagia Sophia was erected as the Holy See of Eastern Christendom (Byzantium) when that empire divided. Later, the Ottomans conquered and ruled from grand palaces here, for six centuries, erecting beautiful mosques, solidifying the Islamic faith as a world religion, and governing a surprisingly progressive empire (by feudal standards). This history built the foundations of the modern Turkish state which emerged, with revolution, in the aftermath of World War I.\n\nThere are no straight roads in the old city, nor even in the 'new city' (which is hundreds of years old). It's easy to get lost, and we did. Lots of times. There are outdoor and indoor markets in every neighbourhood (not just in the famous Grand Bazaar) and at each one someone will try to sell you a carpet, some knock-off name brand clothing, a hookah pipe, or Sahlep ( a delicious creamy hot drink). Apparently the hawkers and hustlers can sniff out Canadians - our hostel concierge warned us that our countrymen are far too polite and are known as easy marks. This is probably the same reason so many Canadians end up owning time share condos in Mexico, and the same reason we ended up paying someone 10 lire (about 5 bucks) to 'help' us find a recommended restaurant (it was one of the times we were lost).\n\nMy western sensibility - or perhaps sensitivity - was challenged by this at times; the smiling faces of the men who would strike up conversation and offer me tea only to turn around and try and sell me a carpet, or a tour, or a leather jacket. Their approach is dogged and persistent. Though I may not appreciate the style, I have to concede that in every culture, the job of the business man is to separate you from your cash. And so it goes. Be polite, be assertive, no thanks.\n\nOn another occasion, I was visiting the Suleymaniye Camii (Sultan Suleyman's Mosque,\u00a0which is every bit as beautiful as the Blue Mosque) and happened to be in the visitor's section when prayers began. I was not the only visitor in the mosque ('camii' in Turkish) at the time, there were many Turks wandering around like me, jaws agape in amazement at the grandeur and serenity of the site. However, I was clearly the only foreigner - and the government employed security guard singled me out. \"No visitor, prayer time,\" he said curtly, and kicked me out. Outside, I waited (just a little peeved) as Turkish tourists continued to file into the visitors section unimpeded. Finally, I plucked up the courage and walked back in. I found a spot at the back of the visitors section, between two Turkish families.... just to blend in... as if.\n\nHaving never been in a mosque before, I felt a little self-conscious as the Imam began the sung prayer - so I just closed my eyes. Having never heard Muslim prayers before, other than the distorted ones through the loudspeakers on the minarets of every mosque, I was at first surprised and then astounded by the beauty of what I heard. I did not hear the words, which I couldn't understand anyway, but only the ephemeral intonations of the soul - the pleading, lonely, tired heart - my heart, longing for release. I like to think of myself as open-minded, and now I was being carried in song, challenged to be open-hearted - confronted by my own fears and prejudice of this faith - and these people - about which I know almost nothing. The architecture and splendour of the domed mosque, such a feast for the eyes, is clearly and finely tuned for this moment of the soul. I was deeply moved.\n\nOutside the mosque, Istanbul raced on.\nSlideshow Report as Spam\n\nMy Review Of The Place I Stayed\n\nLoading Reviews\n  \u2022 Your comment has been posted.

The view was beautiful and the home is extremely well equipped with everything you could possibly need including fresh lemons and limes from the trees on the property. We were also thrilled to see that the owners had decorated the living room when we arrived filling our first Christmas away from home with holiday spirit. Bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and the bedding made us feel like we were staying in a luxury hotel.\n\nThe owners were very response to our numerous emails before our visit and called the day of our arrival to make sure we knew how to get to the property.\n\nThe town of Tiburon was beautiful place to explore on Christmas day even though most everything except the grocery store was closed. We had hoped to go to Muir Woods for a hike that morning, but arrived a little too late to get a parking spot. I would recommend getting there early if you want to go the the park. We also spent Christmas Eve in San Francisco and had no trouble getting a driver (Uber and Lyft) to take us to and from the city. It is a quick 25 minute drive.\n\nWe sincerely enjoyed our few days here and would definitely stay here again!\n\n  \u2022 Submitted: Dec 31, 2016\n  \u2022 Stayed: Dec 2016\n  \u2022 Source: HomeAway\nDid you find this review helpful?\n0 0\n\nAmazing home and Suzi was so helpful and accommodating!

We had a fabulous time in Suzy and Dennis\u2019s beautifully appointed \u201cCasa di Paradiso\u201d home. The location was ideal for Marin County. The view from the deck (which included the San Francisco Bay) was exceptional. The beds were comfortable and cozy.
