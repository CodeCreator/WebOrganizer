The Vaal River and the nearby Grootdraai Dam, the tenth largest dam in South Africa, provide a range of activities for locals and visitors alike, with fishing and boating most likely topping the list. A nine-hole golf course beckons golfers to take some time out, while game farms in the area offer the opportunity to view some of South Africa\u2019s abundant wildlife.\n\nThe town was named after Adriaan Hendrik Stander, a Boer leader who owned the farm on which Standerton was established in 1876. Standerton played a role in South African history when, during the Second Boer War, a British garrison was besieged in the town for three months by Boer forces. When Stander died in 1896 he was buried in the town bearing his name.\n\nFrom small beginnings Standerton has grown into a thriving commercial center, serving a large agricultural community. Accommodation ranges from self-catering guesthouses to guest farms offering a taste of tranquil rural life.

        "text":"New technologies, such as the simplified versions of geographic information systems (GIS)\u2014called \u201cGeodesign\u201d\u2014will help local people, civil servants, and authorities measure the rapid changes tourism will bring into their home communities and visualize the results of different scenarios, so they can better decide how to proceed. Geodesign can help communicities to anticipate impacts from climate change and allow local people to gather data and inform governments about points of concern on a wide range of social, cultural, and environmental health issues, using indicators that are compatible with the SDG goals and the Paris agreement.\n\nGeodesign allows local people to identify where natural resource protection is required and where investments in alternative energy, clean development infrastructure, and protection of green spaces can be made to better manage the future of destinations.\n\nRELATED PROJECT: Regional Planning and Geodesign for Tourism\n\nThis project, launched by ISTI in 2015 continues to work to unite the skills and expertise of many disciplines and professions working in the tourism industry. The International Sustainable Tourism Initiative (ISTI) originally teamed up with the Harvard Graduate School of Design to deploy innovative systems\u2014incorporating Geodesign, modeling and quantitative analysis\u2014to help developers, site managers and hotel corporations work with communities, governments, and businesses to create plans for healthy and sustainable tourism growth.\n\nNew systems for tourism planning are needed to replace the antiquated and unresponsive master planning systems, which costs governments and donors hundreds of millions of dollars worldwide, with a new dynamic approach which foster genuine public collaboration digitally, and help to manage key indicators without requiring new consultancies. This system can inform government actions and allow local people to design their future with human health and well-being and the preservation of ecological and socio-cultural systems as primary goals.\n\nThe original vision for this project was\u00a0implemented at the Harvard Extension School with the course Sustainable Tourism, Regional Planning and Geodesign, which enlisted\u00a0governments, researchers, communities, and planners to take part in creating dynamic tourism destination planning systems. We are sharing this knowledge via interchange and experimentation on Geodesign planning hubs in the global digital classroom. In the next phase pilot projects will be launched in collaboration with local governments, civil society, and businesses.\n\nIceland Case Study\n\nHarvard ISTI\u2019s SMART Destination team worked with the University of Iceland in 2020-2021 to develop a case study on the Westfjords region of Iceland. The goal was to help the Department of Tourism and Innovation of Iceland incorporate regional planning and Geodesign into a robust set of Geodesign base maps to study Westfjords and create a formal case study. A day long workshop with Harvard Extension students was held with Icelandic stakeholders in April of 2021 for the course Sustainable Tourism, Regional Planning, and Geodesign at Harvard Extension School. \u00a0\n\nStudent comments on the workshop program demonstrate the value of using maps as a tool to decide on land-use plans and achieving sustainability for tourism regional development.\n\nThe workshop on April 10th was an eye-opening and inspiring experience. Being able to take the projects that we had each individually worked on \u2014 and bring them to the forefront for discussion, debate, and evaluation\u2013elevated the level of discourse and thought for strategic planning and design.\u00a0 \u2014Student Participant 2021\n\nJosh Weiland, a graduate of the course work on Geodesign and tourism, was awarded the position of Research Manager for this project for six months in 2020-2021 at Harvard Chan School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health, and Faculty Aide Sarah Farooqi assisted on behalf of the Harvard Extension School.\n\nClose Menu",

        "text":"Three Gorges Dam\n\nThree Gorges Dam\n\nOne can not talk about Three Gorges Dam without mentioning the Yangtze Gorges. The Yangtze Gorges lay in the upper reaches of Yangtze River and form a common boundary for Hubei province, Shchuan province and Chongqing city. It arches across Fengjie county and Mt. Wu of Chongqing city, five counties of Hubei province ( Badong, yichang, what are the other 3 counties etc.) and Yichang city. It begins in the west from Baidi City in Fengjie County and ends at Nanjin pass in Yichang city, Hubei province, a distance of 192 kilometers. Yangtze River plunges through Mt. Wu, Huangling Temple and Bamianshan mountainous region which result from Yanshan Movement. Therefore, such three huge gorges as Qutang Gorge, Wu Gorge and Xiling Gorge and Daning River Dale and Xiangxi Dale came into being. \"Three Gorges\" are deemed as their general name.\n\nThe Three Gorges is an area of huge cliffs and high mountains with the Yangtze winding its way though on it progress toward the sea many lilometers away. The gorges are usually 250 meters to 350 meters wide with the narrowest point being about 100 meters wide. The high mountains and deep gorges, form an area of about 1 million square meters' water from the upper reaches of Yangtze River, producing rapid torrents and annual average runoff of more than 450 billion cubic meters. Being one of the largest gorges in the world, the Three Gorges provides an abundant water resources for China.\n\nBefore Liberation, this area contained many dangerous shoals and reefs and was full of speedy riptides and backwashes, causing incidents from time to time. The locals used to say \"It is easier to pass the gates of hell than to pass the Three Gorges\".\n\nAfter Liberation, the Chinese government embarked on program to control the Three Gorges and the waterway was been greatly improved by removing the reefs and directing the water, especially after the construction of the Gezhouba Dam hydro project. The dam raised the water level of the upper reaches by more than 20 meters. The water reached back for more than 100 kilometers and covered the dangerous shoal and reefs and the problems of sailing in the Three Gorges were completely solved. Lighthouses, beacons and navigational aids have beebn erected along the banks and ships can proceed without hindrance day and night.\n\nThe Chinese people have long been good at creating inovatitive structure. On December 14th, 1994, the premier of the day\u00a0 announced the commencement Yangtze Gorges Project. The Three Gorges Project is the biggest hydro junction project in the world that will benefit all of the Chinese nation.\n\nOn December 14th, 1994, the world's largest water-power engineering\u2014Three Gorges Project officially commenced. It situated at Sandouping of Yichang city, Hubei province which is in the middle reach of Xiling Gorge. It is 38 kilometers away from the Gezhouba Dam hydro junction. The Three Gorges Project which would cost 95.46 billion yuan( according the price at the end of May, 1993) is composed of main building project and stream guidance project. The Dam belongs to concrete gravity dam with a length of 3035 meters, a height of 185 meters and a normal impounded level of 175 meters. Its total volume and anti-flood volume stand 39.3 billion cubic meters and 22.15 billion cubic meters respectively, being able to resist the highly destructive flood. Two power plants there are equipped with 26 electricity generators that can produce 84.9 billion kilowatt-hours annually.\n\nThe shipping capacity will increase from the recent 10 million tons to 50 million tons and the thousand-ton-level ship can get Chongqing directly. In the meantime, the transportation cost has decreased by 35%.\n\nThe two modern wonders--Three Gorges and Gezgou Dam will become the new sites of Yangtze River in the near future, adding new flavor to the river. As a combination of natural beauty, historical relics and modern wonders, the Three Gorges will attract and fascinate tourists from all over the world. The Three Gorges stands at Zhongbao island of Sandouping of Yichang city, Hubei province. It is 38 kilometers away from the Gezhouba Dam hydro junction and the largest hydro junction project in the world.\n\nAt 2 pm, May 20th 2006, the excited erectors on the top of the dam witness the historic moment of pouring the last cubic of concrete into the dam. Up till then, the largest-scale concrete dam of the world is ultimately established.\nAs a steel- concrete gravity dam, the three Gorges used 16 million concrete and sand rock materials. If laid at one cubic meter level, the overall concrete can revolve around the Earth for more than three circles.\n\nThe 185-meter-above-sea-level Three Gorge Dam is the core of Three Gorge hydro junction project and takes 3080 days to complete. During the construction, the builders comprehensively adopt the state-of-art technique in the world and create a world record of pouring 20 thousand concrete in a single day at the peak time.\n\nUp till now, 126 billion yuan have been invested into the Three Gorges Project. In the meantime, thanks to the installment of twenty six 700-thousand-kilowatt super electricity generators, 84.7 billion watt electricity can generated. The emergence of flat lake in the high gorge end the history of non- night navigation in Chuan River and 10 thousand ton class sheet can go right through to Chongqing.\n\nThe Three Gorges Tourist Area was officially opened to the public in 1997, covering an area of 15.28 square meters. It contains five parks. They are Three Gorges Exhibition Hall, Tanziling Park, 185 Park, Jinba Park and Interception Memorial Park. Based on the world's largest hydro junction project, the tourist area reveals the culture of the project and water conservancy in an all-round way. It provides a combination of multi-functional service of sight-seeing, science and education, entertainment, refreshment, perfectly combining modern project with natural scenery and human landscape. Therefore, it is a traveling paradise that tourists from home and abroad long to go.\n\nTanziling Park is the earliest developed tourist area and started to receive tourists from all over the world since 1997. Since its shape resembles a crock, its name Tanziling (Crock Mountain) came into being. Locating at the investigation point of the Dam, the tourist area is 262.48 meters above sea level and the perfect place to appreciate the panoramic view of Three Gorges Project. Standing there, you could not only admire the magnificence of the Three Gorges Dam but also can vow for the \"The Fourth Gorge of Yangtze River\"\u2014Two Way Five-Lift Lock which stands like a cliff. The whole park is divided into three layers from the top to the bottom according to its height. It mainly composed of mould exhibition, sub fluvial stone of Wannian River, interception stone of the Big River, cornerstone of the Three Gorges Dam, silver version sealed book and Tanziling gazebo. At the same time, they are interspersed by magnificent fountains, wandering brooks and emerald green lawn. Looking from afar, the hustle and bustle is accompanied by serenity and vice versa, as if roaming in Alice's fairytale land.\n\nStanding at the top of the Dam which is 185 meters above sea level, the tourists can marvel at the flood discharge downwards in a close distance. Feeling the tremendous force growling under the feet is more direct and magnificent. In the meantime, contrasted with the near overwhelming backwash, the river surface far away is quiet and peaceful. All of a sudden, the tourists may feel the gorgeous blend of vitality and serenity. If it is good weather, a colorful rainbow will appear in the water fog above the flood. Gentle wind present by the river soothes the soul and the lullaby murmured by the backwash calm the heart. All the feelings, exited or surprised, proud or exhilarated are all mingle with the span of water. Maybe only after you roaming in the hug of the Dam can one genuinely feel the line \"Should the goddess be not ill today, she will marvel at the world's new array\".\n\nThe sightseeing position locates in the front of the left bank electricity generating set factory of the Dam. It is the perfect place to admire the Dam and water discharge. Stand on the sightseeing flat and look upwards, the tourists can see a magnificent-than-ever 185 meters high Dam. The spray under the factory and the systematic transmission line show that powerful electric current are being transferred to all around China relentlessly. Due to the change of appreciation angle, the imposing water discharge can render the tourists excited with heart afire. They can experience the great power of the Nature. However, with unchallenged wisdom, human beings can finally conquer the Nature.\n\n\"Stone walls still stand in the waters west,\nTo block clouds and rains from Wushan crest,\nTo make a placid lake between the cliffs steep,\nShould the goddess be not ill today ,\nShe will marvel at the world's new array.\"\n\nThese lines which are full of power, grandeur and lofty sentiments are excerpted from the poem of Chairman Mao. He wrote it in 1956 after his third visit to Yangtze River. Today, his dream is realized by Three Gorges builders.\n\nYangtze River Attractions\n\nYangtze River Map",

Located roughly a mile away from the ocean this summit has good views of the landmark Aliso Peak as well as many of the larger peaks towards the east including Santiago Peak, Old Baldy and San Gorgonio. Unfortunately this summit area as now a gated upper class residential area. Therefore you can make this peak a drive up but it not recommended.\n\nCactus Flower\nSome of the local vegatation\n\nYou can of course take a road all the way to summit area, put your flashers on and take a bunch of pictures or you can choose the better much more scenic approach which is to take Valido Trail to the saddle between Aliso Peak and Niguel Hill. From there take the Niguel Hill trail cutoff up the ridge and as rises steeply to the beginning of the gated community. This cutoff that rises steeply up to the summit is by far the most part of the whole Niguel Hill area. From there stay on the trail all of the way to the Seaview park. If you are destined to hit the exact highest rock be sure to get into the bushes. Views on the summit are partially restricted due to the amount of thick bushes.\n\nLooking north over Niguel Hill\nThe view looking north from the top\n\nThere is also a park sign on the summit area naming the park Seaview Park as well as a number of other signs on the summit area naming many of the plant species on the summit.

Take West Street roughly 100 yards to a road signed Valido Street (on Google this is listed as Paseo Del Sur but the sign on the street is Valido Street). Make a left here and 100 feet up a inclined dirt pull off with enough room for maybe two cars will be on your left.\n\nFOR THOSE INCLINED TO DO THE DRIVE UP: (You are really missing the charms of this peak\n\nFROM I-5: Take Crown Valley Parkway toward South Laguna. Make a right on Alicia Parkway. Then make a left on Pacific Island. Head up the hill until reaching Talavares. Make a right onto Talaveras and take all the way up until the near the gate to the community where parking will be on your right.\n\nFROM THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY: Make a left onto Pacific Island and head up the hill. Once at Talaveras make a left and head to the gate. The park will be on your right hand side.\n\nRed Tape\n\nThe Valido Trail\nThe trail beginnings!\n\nParking is very limited in an upper class residential area. No smoking on the trail. It is advised not to hike Aliso Peak after a rainstorm due to the very muddy nature of the trail.\n\nA reminder that Park hours are posted up on Talveras Drive.
