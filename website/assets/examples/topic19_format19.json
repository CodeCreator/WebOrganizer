(This text reflects annotations as of Thursday, July 24, 2014.) MGI curation of this mouse gene is considered complete, including annotations derived from the biomedical literature as of February 9, 2010. If you know of any additional information regarding this mouse gene please let us know. Please supply mouse gene symbol and a PubMed ID.\nSummary from NCBI RefSeq\n\n[Summary is not available for the mouse gene. This summary is for the human ortholog.] This nuclear gene encodes a mitochondrial matrix protein that appears to contribute to peptide chain termination in the mitochondrial translation machinery. Two different 1 bp deletions (resulting in the same premature stop codon)result in decreased mitochondrial translation, decreased levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes and encepthalomyopathy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
