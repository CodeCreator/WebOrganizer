Well back to the FAQ, I will update the score high and the\n    multiplayer maybe tomorrow, but school starts. Since its the first day I dont think we\n    will do much so there should be a update. I have beat the game with cyrus and kahli and\n    I am going to do it with the other characters so the sponsorship section should be com-\n    plete too. Oh yah check out the new secret its weird, it supposed to be a move, but I\n    cant do it.

        "text":"New York, NY\n\nEvent takes place at 10:00 AM on April 26, 2014.\n\nWhat is DASH 6?\n\nDASH (Different Area, Same Hunt) is a fun, interactive event where teams of players race to find and solve creative puzzles hidden in different locations in cities all over the world. From fictitious graveyards to s'mores designed in Morse code to music clips containing a hidden message, anything is possible to encounter when playing in the DASH puzzle hunt.\n\nAll teams across the world will be working on the same 10 puzzles over the course of a max of 8-hours.\u00a0\n\nPuzzles will not be labor intensive, aside from moving between locations, which will be within a few blocks of each other.\n\nWhen and Where?\n\nSign-in will be open at 9:30AM with opening remarks at 9:45AM. Puzzling will begin at 10:00AM and is expected to end no later than 6:00PM, Eastern time. Experienced teams may finish faster.\n\nThe start location will be Nelson Rockefeller Park at the west-most point of Warren Street (and River Terrace). There is a pivilion there where the day will kick-off.\n\nHow many people should be on my team?\n\nThe optimal size for a team is 3-5 players. More than 5 and it gets difficult for everyone to collaborate, we highly encourage splitting into two teams.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nDASH6 registration fee will be $40 per team. Payment instructions will be sent to registered teams.\n\nWhat about the weather?\n\nYou will be walking and puzzling outside for much of the day, so be prepared for potential rain.\n\nInterested in Volunteering?\n\nNew York is looking for volunteers for Game Control on April 26. Come enjoy DASH from the other side! Email us if you are interested in helping out.\n\nOther FAQ\n\nContact Information\n\nSimon Shewmaker (727) 871-5821 [email\u00a0protected]\n\n\nRegistration has concluded.",

Send me your steam inventory link so we can verify the purchases.\n\n\nQ: Can I buy more than one copy somehow ?\n\nA: We are working to solve this issue as I realize buying more than 5 copies is painful, hopefully this gets sorted for the next sale.\n\nA: Yes!

You thus get to keep the Tavern Card you receive in addition to the 2 gold.\n\nHow do you split the fame gained from defeating a Legendary Pirate, if several players participated in the attack?\nThe fame gets divided equally (and rounded down, if necessary) between all surviving players at the moment the Legendary Pirate or Royal Navy gets defeated.\n\nIn the rules, what does westward mean exactly?\n-Westward means clockwise, in ascending numerical order, starting from Tavern Island (# 1), and finishing up with Treasure Island (#6) and Pirate's Cove.\n\nCan I play the Royal Navy on my own Island (to help me defeat an enemy, for instance, or to acquire additional fame)?\nNo you can't. You can only tip off her Royal Majesty's ships to another Pirate's hideaway than the one you moor at.\n\nCan you make repairs on your ship, even if it was not crippled when it fled to Pirate's Cove?\nNo you can't, nor can you repair a section that was not damaged below the water line (i.e. whose strength marker wasn't pushed off-board)\n\nWhat is the exact meaning of \"booty\" on the Consort event card?\nBooty means all the spoils from the plunder, ie not only treasures, but also all gold, fame and tavern cards potentially collected.",
