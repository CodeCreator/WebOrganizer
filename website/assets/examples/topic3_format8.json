        "text":"UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION LITIGATION RELEASE NO. 15381 \/ June 5, 1997 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. ROBERT C. COWAN, et al., 5:96-CV-0224-C, USDC, ND\/TX (Lubbock Division) The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") announced that on June 2, 1997, an Agreed Final Judgment was entered against Robert C. Cowan (\"Cowan\"), individually and doing business as CS Investments Trust (\"CSI\"), and Cowan Asset Management, Inc., (\"CAMI\"), an investment adviser registered with the Commission. The Agreed Final Judgment permanently enjoins Cowan, individually and doing business as CSI, from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Cowan and CAMI are permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder, and Cowan is permanently enjoined from aiding and abetting any CAMI violations. The Court also ordered Cowan to pay disgorgement in the amount of $3,080,418, plus prejudgment interest. However, this amount will be reduced by the value of the assets Cowan surrendered to the Special Master, the final total of which will be determined in the Special Master's final report. Based on Cowan's demonstrated financial inability to pay, the Court waived collection of whatever disgorgement amount remains after the value of Cowan's assets turned over to the Special Master has been deducted. Additionally, based on Cowan's financial condition, the Court will not order him to pay a civil penalty. According to the complaint filed on November 5, 1996, Cowan raised between $1 million and $3 million from his customers for the purpose of purchasing trust units in CSI. In fact, according to the complaint, CSI does not exist, apart from Cowan's misrepresentations and created records, and does not hold securities or funds for customers; rather, Cowan used customers' funds for his personal expenses, and to satisfy periodic payments and redemptions for his customers as part of a \"ponzi\" scheme. ======END OF PAGE 1======",
