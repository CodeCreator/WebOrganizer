        "text":"Fire TV Horror Games: Couch-Games Halloween Picks\n\nHalloween rears its ugly head once again which inspired us to squelch our brains to find the best Fire TV horror games. Sit in the dark, turn up the volume and play these Couch-Games picks!\n\nHeart-wrenchingly, there\u2019s not much lurking out there in the Fire TV horror games shadows\u2013do you hear us developers of the night? Nevertheless, after copious exsanguination we put together a selection covering most game genres. Creep out or cackle to these and stay tuned for full reviews of our top picks.\n\nGrave Stompers vid\n\n\nMaxMax is a zombie killing zombie kid brought back to save the town with a chainsaw & loads of firepower. GraveStompers by Mad Menace Entertainment is a console-style 3rd-person shooter with killer evil-cute 3D graphics & blood galore. No real story or complicated gameplay here, just a zombie vs zombie splatter banquet to keep the gamepad smoking. Great gruesome undead-kid characters, switchable melee or firing weapons and necrophagously nice artwork make for viciously fun gameplay!\n\nwalking dead vid\n\n\u00a0The Walking Dead\u2013Season Two\n\nwalking dead thumbKind of like controlling the TV series or changing the graphic novel, The Walking Dead Season 2 by Telltale Games is a mega-creepy episodic interactive drama graphic adventure game. This season you are little Clementine on the run in the zombie apocalypse trying to stay alive. With a combo of point-and-click controls, gamepad moves and dialogue-answer decisions you literally play through the hellish 5 episodes (with IAP\u2019s). Needless to say, the graphic novel-like artwork is incredible and the drama really eats you to the bone. Unfortunately, only season two is available on Fire TV as yet\u2026 Ggrrr\u00e4aaahhhhhhhh!\n\nRoute Z vid\n\n\u00a0Route Z\n\nz logoMoonshark Inc brings you this pick of Fire TV horror games\u2026 and yes it\u2019s got zombies! Route Z is like Mad Max meets Death Race meets undead hordes in an endless racer-shooter game genre combo. In the apocalypse, road-rage is good! You tool down the Soulless Wasteland highway grinding up z\u2019s with simple left-right controls avoiding obstacles like roadblocks, wrecks, explosive fuel barrels and fiery z\u2019s. Upgrades are tough (aside from IAP\u2019s), but with several tasks, 3 scenes and a shredding metal soundtrack, normal play is death driving fun!\n\nhaunted past vid\n\n\u00a0Haunted Past\n\nhaunted pastCall it tame horror, but Haunted Past by Gogii Games is classic ghost-story eeriness in a hidden object puzzle game apparition. In a nether century Emily fell to her death, plummeting from an attic window\u2026 why? This is the mystery. Inheriting the dark abandoned mansion, Sara Haverston realises there is a shadowy presence astir. Personally, I\u2019m no big fan of hidden object games, but this one is certainly worthy of lights-out-sound-up-big-screen spookiness. The artwork is beautiful and the ghostly-stormy-creepy-sound fx make for a great Halloween atmosphere!\n\naftermath vid\n\n\u00a0Aftermath XHD\n\naftermath thumbLife (or death) wouldn\u2019t be the same without a good old zombie shooter. TwoHeads Games managed to take a genre (which nowadays is kinda\u2019 gettin\u2019 old) and make it scary like it should be. Aftermath XHD is meaty among the choice of Fire TV horror games because it has atmosphere. An uneasy sense of urgency pervades gameplay, making things uncomfortable\u2013including hordes of fast undead flesh munchers! HD graphics with killer textures & environment aesthetics add to the fast-paced kill-fest action.\n\nknock knock vid\n\n\u00a0Knock Knock\n\nKnock Knock by Indie-developer Ice-Pick Lodge is the Couch-Games top Fire TV horror games pick! This game is out there\u2026 I mean spooky weirdness at a distance!\u00a0However, you\u2019ll have to wait until Halloween for a full review, so stay tuned\u2026(update): Knock Knock review\n\nWait, what the hell was that noise? I think\u2026 something\u2019s in the house\u2026\n\nAmazon logo\n\n\n\nAmazon logoThe Walking Dead Season 2\n\n\n\nAmazon logoRoute Z\n\n\n\nAmazon logoHaunted Past\n\n\n\nKnock KnockAmazon logo\nComments (0)\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text":"The 12 best iPhone and iPad puzzle games\n\nGive your brain an enjoyable workout with these varied, brilliant puzzle picks.\n\npuzzle games lead\n\nSmart choices\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of diversions on the App Store, but why waste your spare time on some mindless grind when you can enjoy a perfectly portable puzzler instead? We\u2019ve loved a great many iPhone and iPad puzzle games over the years, but we\u2019ve whittled our list down to just a dozen of the best ones that are still well worth your attention today.\u00a0\n\nSome have you navigate tricky environments while others focus on numbers or processes; some are atmospheric or ethereal while others are bright and poppy. We\u2019ve kept out word puzzlers with the intention of highlighting those separately in the future, but there\u2019s still a diverse mix in here and no two games are exactly alike\u2014and all come highly recommended.\n\nbest puzzle monument\n\nMonument Valley\n\nMonument Valley ($4) is the quintessential iOS puzzle game. It\u2019s inventive, it\u2019s compact, it looks spectacular, and it\u2019s perfect for touch. Ustwo\u2019s iOS original finds you solving impossible environmental puzzles, but they\u2019re not \u201cimpossible\u201d because they\u2019re difficult\u2014they\u2019re impossible because they rely on visual trickery and feature architecture that doesn\u2019t make any logical sense. But that\u2019s the fun in it, as you rotate and contort the levels to guide princess Ida to the goal in each.\n\nGiven its profile, chances are good that you\u2019ve already played Monument Valley. But have you played the Forgotten Shores expansion (via in-app purchase), or better yet, Monument Valley 2? Whatever the case, you should soak up as much of this dreamy brain-pleaser as you can.\n\nbest puzzle threes\n\n\nLooking for a puzzler with a bit more bite? Threes! ($3) can probably do the trick. It\u2019s one of the most delightfully challenging puzzlers we\u2019ve ever obsessed over, and unlike Monument Valley, it\u2019s an endless game that you can revisit time and again for a new experience.\n\nThrees! is all about addition, but there are rules: you can add blue 1 and red 2 tiles together to make a 3, but from there, you can only combine identical number tiles: 3 + 3 make 6, 6 + 6 makes 12, and so on and so forth. But swiping the screen to make these merges moves every tile that has a place to move to, and it adds a new tile to the screen. With space in increasingly short supply, you\u2019ll need to make calculated decisions\u00a0to keep your game alive. There\u2019s a free, ad-supported version too.\n\nbest puzzle minimetro\n\nMini Metro\n\nGreat puzzle games can be found anywhere\u2014even within a subway map. That\u2019s the premise of the sharp Mini Metro ($5), which finds you trying to match up to the task of supporting an ever-expanding transit system. It starts simply enough with a couple of stations and a single train, but as the weeks carry on, you\u2019ll have to add more lines, trains, cars, and tunnels to avoid overcrowding.\n\nHow you meet that goal is really up to you, as you use your limited resources to build the most efficient system possible. Mini Metro is tough, but addictive, with its ultra-minimal visual aesthetic belying a fairly complex and continual challenge beneath. And with 18 maps all based on real-life cities, you\u2019ll find plenty to keep you playing.\n\nbest puzzle mushroom11\n\nMushroom 11\n\nMushroom 11 ($5) is an odd little game, and the grungy, gritty look might put some people off\u2014but this is a unique iOS game that\u2019s well worth savoring. Essentially, Mushroom 11 finds you controlling a malleable, blob-like organism in some kind of destroyed, post-apocalyptic wasteland, and you\u2019ll need care to guide it through the wreckage.\n\nPart puzzle game, part slow-paced platformer, Mushroom 11 challenges you to use one or more fingers to prod the blob to coax it towards its destination. You\u2019ll squeeze through tunnels, climb fences, evade lava pools, and even overcome boss characters simply by manipulating the green gunk in various ways. It\u2019s really clever and perfectly suited for touch, too.\n\nbest puzzle goodsnowman\n\nA Good Snowman is Hard to Build\n\nDo you want to build a snowman? Now you won\u2019t have to wait for the appropriate season: just fire up A Good Snowman is Hard to Build ($4) and get to rolling. Of course, as the title suggests, this isn\u2019t just a breezy sandbox game: building a proper snowman is indeed challenging, especially when provided with these confined garden locales.\n\nIn each area, you\u2019ll find three prepared snowballs, and your little monster man will need to roll them to get the finished product. However, rolling a snowball upon fresh snow only makes it larger, and you need three balls\u2014in order from large to small\u2014to complete the task. How can you properly roll the snowballs to make a good snowman? That\u2019s your brainy task to solve.\n\nbest puzzle laracroftgo\n\nLara Croft Go\n\nYou probably know Lara Croft from the epic and exciting Tomb Raider games on consoles and PC, but Lara Croft Go ($5) sends the iconic adventurer on a new kind of voyage\u2014a puzzling one. Here, Croft must overcome a series of environmental challenges, as each level finds you moving her space to space as you dodge trips, vault over obstacles, and even take down some enemies.\n\nDespite the slower pace, new look, and change in perspective, what\u2019s surprisingly satisfying about Lara Croft Go is how much it retains the tone of the original source material. And thanks to updates, there\u2019s plenty here, with more than 115 puzzles in play. Also, if you dig this one, be sure to play its sister games, Deus Ex Go and Hitman Go.\n\nbest puzzle blek\n\n\nMost puzzle games are guided by hard and firm rules or have fixed solutions, but in the effortlessly cool Blek ($4), you\u2019ll create your own solutions\u2014with your fingertip. This iOS original finds you presented with a bare screen with some colorful dots, and you\u2019ll need to draw an animated pattern that can hit all of those dots in one motion without touching a single black dot.\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019ll doodle a little line or zigzag somewhere on the screen and then watch as it is let loose onto the puzzle, swerving and swaying towards hopeful success. Blek is all trial and error, and there are no breaks in the action: you can keep doodling and doodling until something works. It\u2019s ingenious, really.\n\nbest puzzle causality\n\n\nAltering space and time is easy-peasy, right? Uh, nope\u2014not in Causality ($2), at least. This bright and attractive indie game finds you guiding little astronauts along paths. Actually, scratch that: little astronauts are walking along paths and you\u2019ll need to manipulate the space-time continuum to somehow get them safely to each exit.\n\nEach level is fraught with danger, packing in things like crumbling tiles and weird alien tentacles, plus there are switches to step on and other helpful opportunities. Also, time-warp portals create another version of your astronaut in a different location and timeframe. Sound like something that\u2019ll screw with your mind? Yes, Causality will definitely do that.\n\nbest puzzle prune\n\n\nTrimming a Bonsai tree can be a peaceful activity, and likewise, Prune ($4) strikes its own tranquil tone. But this cool and calm puzzler takes a few twists along the way, adding in a bit of challenge all the while without losing its unique demeanor.\n\nEach game begins with a sapling stuck in the ground, and it rapidly begins growing upwards. Your job is to help guide it towards the light\u2014and away from dangerous areas\u2014by snipping unnecessary branches. That helps the trunk and most ambitious branches get ever closer to the light, while things like wind and bright red spots can disrupt your progress. Prune is serene and satisfying, and truly unlike any other puzzler you\u2019ll find on the App Store.\n\nbest puzzle room3\n\nThe Room Three\n\nYou should probably start with the original The Room, but The Room Three ($4) is the biggest and best of the bunch\u2014and really, you can\u2019t go wrong with the entire trilogy. Each game serves up an eerie and hugely atmospheric adventure in which you must solve 3D puzzle boxes and unlock other contraptions, which you\u2019ll do by looking all around, finding clues, and fiddling with the devices.\n\nManipulating the objects on a touch device feels really intuitive and tactile, and the puzzles are frequently complex and engrossing. The games only got more ambitious and larger in scale, and The Room Three here is the culmination of one of the App Store\u2019s most impressive original offerings in any genre.\n\nbest puzzle device6\n\nDevice 6\n\nSimogo has made some of the most memorable and singularly impressive games on the App Store, including Beat Sneak Bandit and Year Walk, but Device 6 ($4) might be the studio\u2019s crowning achievement. On the surface, it\u2019s a text adventure\u2014albeit one in which the actual words on the screen create visible pathways based on the action in this spy tale, making you rotate your phone to keep up with the events.\u00a0\n\nBut there\u2019s more than just reading here: audio and visual elements punctuate the text and present puzzles to solve. They\u2019re plenty brainy too, and some may take long stretches of time (hint: take notes if you\u2019re overwhelmed). It\u2019s deeply clever, through and through.\n\nbest puzzle worldgoo\n\nWorld of Goo\n\nHow does a nine-year-old PC and console game ride high as one of the best puzzle games on iPhone and iPad? Well, when it\u2019s World of Goo ($5), it accomplishes the feat by being absolutely brilliant. This charming and quirky game might have started with a Wii Remote or a mouse pointer, but it feels just as much at home with your finger on a touch screen.\n\nIn World of Goo, you\u2019ll build quick structures to overcome large gaps or build to a skyward exit, and you\u2019ll do so using little, sticky balls that connect to one another. Over time, the challenges become tougher and the goo balls pick up some curious new abilities, plus the game loads in unexpectedly unsettling atmosphere despite the cartoonish look. It\u2019s an older pick, but thankfully, it\u2019s been updated with 64-bit support.",

        "text":"\n\n\nBy David \u201cLoudon Ofton\u201d Drury\n\nHow Dealers Trick You Into Losing\n\nWhen you push your money into the blackjack circle and faced off against a dealer, you are playing the best odds in the house.\n\nYou can even turn the advantage to your favor. But not so fast.\n\nIf you thought it was merely the cards you were battling, you have another thing coming. The combat measures began before you even sat down. The game behind the game of blackjack involves getting you to the table and keeping you there. What you may not know is that it also involves making sure your chances for winning are minimized, while your commitment to the idea of winning is maximized.\n\nThe real tricksters are usually not the dealers themselves. They are the casinos that hire them, train them, and monitor them. The dealers are pawns serving the casino\u2019s bottom line. Dealers mostly just want to get good tips, not get fired, and maybe have some fun along the way.\n\nEnter \u201cSophie,\u201d a casino dealer turned professional card counter (she requested\u00a0that her name be changed\u00a0so casinos cannot identify her). After eight years of dealing table games at a large casino, she became fed up with how casinos were run and decided to put her efforts at taking money\u00a0out of casinos\u00a0through card counting at blackjack. She was happy to offer her input into how dealers think and casinos operate.\n\nStraight from a dealer\u2019s first hand experience, here are five ways that casino dealers compound your disadvantage.\n\nGiving bad playing advice\n\nCasinos don't want you to use your brainBasic strategy (sometimes referred to as \u201cthe book\u201d) involves the list of playing decisions a player can make in any given situation which are mathematically most advantageous. This is not a secret. This is math. Sometimes casinos will even make cards with basic strategy available at the table. But they will never insist you follow it. Never be fooled by a dealer\u2019s \u201csage\u201d advice.\n\n\u00a0\u201cMaybe five percent of dealers know basic strategy\u2026 MAYBE,\u201d says \u201cSophie,\u201d a former casino dealer turned card counter. \u201cEven if dealers\u00a0know it, very few believe in it. They still give really bad advice.\u201d The casino wants you to believe it has your best interests in mind, but in practice we\u00a0have no interest at all in seeing that you make sound playing decisions. Why is that? Sound decisions decrease their bottom line. Likewise, dealers are encouraged to keep play moving. More rounds played per hour means more money for the casino. Forcing you to make a quick decision is often just as bad as suggesting you make a wrong one.\n\nFake optimism\n\nDealers are dedicated to the veneer that the casino has created\u2014that this is a happy place where winning is more than possible. It\u2019s a dealer\u2019s job to welcome you, make small talk, and generally instill hope at the expense of the likely-today-certain-over-time outcome. When you are losing, they\u2019ll chalk it up to bad luck. \u201cIt will turn around,\u201d they suggest. \u201cIt\u2019s got to turn around eventually.\u201d How many times have you heard that one?\n\n\u201cWe\u00a0want a happy player at their game for two reasons,\u201d said Sophie. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way we\u00a0make money off of tips; and it makes for a really long night if people are pissed off and losing. we\u00a0want to keep spirits up so players keep playing and keep tipping.\u201d\n\nTip whoring\n\ncasinos love gamblersNot only do casinos take money out of your pocket, they expect you to help pay their employees so they don\u2019t have to, in the form of tips. \u201cWhen you make money I make money,\u201d they say, as if it is a project you are working on together.\n\nWhen you win big, they want a share of the riches. But when you lose, they often suggest it is because you haven\u2019t been tipping. Either way, it just decreases the chance of a winning night.\n\nAfter all, when the dealer wins big, he or she doesn\u2019t tip you.\n\nKeeping the drinks coming\n\nWhat if business people kept plying you with alcohol while you were in the midst of making financial decisions like buying a home or car? That is the essence of what the casino is doing when they offer you free drinks at the table. They know you will be inclined to make bad decisions. Walk 20 feet to the bar and the drinks are full price. They don\u2019t want you paying full price for drinks at the bar. You are worth more money to them at the table.\n\n\u201cDealers say, \u2018Have a drink! Have a drink!\u2019\u201d says Sophie. \u201cTheir declared intention might be for you have a good time, but I\u2019ve seen people lose not just their money, but their entire lives. The way management sees things perpetuates the sickness. That\u2019s what made me want to get out.\u201d\n\nPretending to be your friend\n\n\u201cCome sit down at the table,\u201d the dealers say. They welcome you warmly. They receive your tips graciously. They will chat you up about anything and everything. The front might even disappear as soon as it becomes clear you aren\u2019t tipping. But it certainly evaporates into nothing once you leave the table, never mind when you leave the casino. Dealers don\u2019t wander the floor with players, and you won\u2019t see them in the food court or the parking lot. Their job is to be your friend when and only when the money is on the table. Sure they are all wearing tuxedo shirts, but nobody is asking you to the prom.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in management,\u201d recounts Sophie, \u201cwe would always say to dealers, \u2018You are actors and actresses. Put on a show.\u2019 But the minute the players walked out, none of us thought twice about them.\u201d\n\nSurprise surprise, Dealers are just trying to make money. Casinos are just trying to take money. Is it so hard to believe they would work hard to get yours?\n\n\u201cAll this panic goes on when someone\u2019s winning,\u201d says Sophie, \u201cbut when players are losing, there\u2019s no thought or remorse for the fact that [casinos]\u00a0still want more from the player\u2014more, more, as much as they can take.\u201d\n\nPlay smart. Know what to watch out for and protect your money for the situations and strategies that give you a real chance to win.",

        "text":"Popular Family Games\n\nPopular Family Games\n\nWhile just about any board game can be enjoyed by the whole family, some games are just classic \u201cfamily\u201d oriented games. In general, that means they\u2019re good for a wide range of ages and players.\n\nHere\u2019s the five most popular family games.\n\n5. Boggle\n\nThough Boggle is described as being \u201cfor 2 or more players\u201d, we\u2019ve found that more than five or six makes the game very difficult. Boggle is listed as being for ages \u201c8 and up\u201d, though you may find that many children younger than 8 are perfectly capable of playing.\n\nIn Boggle, players compete with each other to find as many words as possible in a 4\u00d74 grid of jumbled letters. There\u2019s a three minute time limit, after which point totals are added up based on the number of words you\u2019ve found. The only words that count at words that the other players didn\u2019t find.\n\nBoggle is a fast-paced \u201cword game\u201d, and the easy game play and quick setup make it a repeat play for many families.\n\nPopular Family Games\n\n4. Chutes and Ladders\n\nThis is a pretty boring game, especially for people above the age of six. Unfortunately, it is also most kid\u2019s favorite game when they are younger. The reason this appeals to families is because kids demand to play it. They understand the simple way you play the game, they\u2019re drawn to the colors and the drawings, and once kids win a few rounds of this simple \u201cprogression\u201d game, they\u2019ll want to play again and again.\n\nMany different versions of Chutes and Ladders exist, but they\u2019re all pretty much the same. Buy this one for the kids, but try to get them into Monopoly as soon as you can.\n\n3. Checkers\n\nCheckers boards are as easy to find as 7-11s. You can buy checkers and chess sets at retail pharmacies, big box stores, and even travel versions at gas stations and truck stops. Checkers is popular because almost everyone knows how to play, and because kids and adults alike both love to \u201cjump\u201d the opponent, form Kings, and dominate a Checkers board.\n\nPart strategy game (similar in many ways to Chess) and part \u201ccapture\u201d game, Checkers is playable as young as five years old and is a game the whole family can agree on.\n\n2. Jenga\n\nJenga is a simple board game involving player\u2019s using their fingers to gently draw blocks out of a pre-fabricated structure. A strange board game, in that it involves more physical and less intellectual skill, Jenga appeals to kids because of the dramatic way in which the Jenga blocks fall to the ground. Older people like Jenga, too\u2013it turns out that there\u2019s plenty of strategy in removing Jenga blocks.\n\n1. Clue\n\nWhen I was a kid, Clue was my family\u2019s main board game. If you grew up in the 80s, your family may have been the same. Clue is one of the earliest \u201csimulation\u201d type games in which you pretend to be something you\u2019re not, in this case, a detective investigating a murder. The board is unique\u2013a layout of an old mansion complete with secret passageways and murder weapons. Clue is playable as young as 8, and \u201cjunior\u201d versions exist if the game is still a bit too \u201cgrown up\u201d for your kids.\n\nVN:F [1.9.22_1171]\nRating: 0.0\/10 (0 votes cast)\nVN:F [1.9.22_1171]\nRating: 0 (from 0 votes)\nCopyright \u00a9 Life Guides.
