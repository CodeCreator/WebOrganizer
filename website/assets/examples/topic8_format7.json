        "text":"How do you find the right shade of foundation?\n\n\nQuick Answer\n\nTo find the right foundation, test dabs foundation on a clean face in an area on which no foundation has been applied previously. A few different shades should be applied on different spots of the cheeks or jaw lines. The shade that blends in the best is the right shade for the complexion.\n\nContinue Reading\nHow do you find the right shade of foundation?\nCredit: Studio 504 Stone Getty Images\n\nFull Answer\n\nArtificial light is unreliable, so the results of foundation tests should always be viewed in natural day light. When choosing the right shade of foundation, it is very important to remember that the shade should be as close as possible to the color of the skin. People with pale skin shouldn't use foundation with pink tones. Beige tones are best for that skin tone. If the right shade can't be found, the darker option should always be chosen, never the lighter one, because it can seem very unnatural. Foundation should not be bought without testing it on the skin.\n\nSkin type is also very important. If the skin is dry, creamy liquid or stick foundation should be used. If the skin is oily, oil-free liquid foundation or powder foundation is the best option. If the skin is a combination of oily and dry, good options are cream to powder bases or the more powdery bases. For more mature skin, the best options are formulas that contain labels like poreless, strike free or similar.\n\nLearn more about Make-up\n\nRelated Questions",

If there are no other people around to play charades, dancing games such as Just Dance serve the same purpose.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nFull Answer\n\nDance games are available for video game consoles such as the Nintendo Wii or the Xbox Kinect. The average waiting time between coats of nail polish is two minutes, and the average song is two to five minutes. Therefore one song between each coat is sufficient.
