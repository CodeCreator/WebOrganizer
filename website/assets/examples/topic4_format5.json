        "text":"What will I experience?\n\nA folk high school is a non-formal residential school offering learning opportunities in almost any subject including history, arts, music, sports, philosophy, theatre, photography etc. The schools decide on the content of the courses individually, but must answer to the Ministry of Culture as to the inclusiveness and broadness of the cultural education.\n\nThe courses are meant to broaden general, social and democratic competences. The courses last between one and 36 weeks and do not lead to any tests or examinations. A completion of a course will also not lead to admittance to any other educational institution in Denmark.\n\nLiving and studying together\n\nAt a folk high school you live together and experience each other in \u00a0many different social situations. During your stay at a folk high school, you live, eat, study, party and clean together with the other students. Everybody has the same duties and the same rights - no matter sex, social status, religion, nationality, ethnicity etc. As the students often represent a wide range of backgrounds and you live closely together in both good times and hard, everybody has to do their best to get the most out of the day for the school as a whole.\n\nRespect, equality, cooperation, dialogue and tolerance are some of the keywords in making daily life at the folk high schools work. And this is not only the case amongst the students. One of the core ideas of the folk high schools is equality and mutual learning between teachers and students. The classes are characterized by the free word, dialogue and an open curriculum which can be changed during the course.\n\nGet ready to sing\n\nAttending a folk high school you must \u00a0be prepared to sing - a lot! Singing is a strong part of Folk High School culture. The song promotes the atmosphere of togetherness and transcends the differences which might cause troubles in the everyday life at the school. The folk high school has a long tradition of community singing - especially from their own folk high school songbook. The songbook came in a new edition in 2006 - updated with both new and old songs in both Danish, English, German etc.\n\n\nThe main language at most of the folk high schools in Denmark is Danish - but many of the schools have taken steps to receive foreign students.\n\nAt some of the schools they use translation equipment, some have courses especially for international students, some do courses in Danish language for foreigners while others try to implement both English and Danish in both teaching and everyday life.\n\nBefore you choose a school it is important to clarify your own needs and talents and what you \u00a0expect from your stay. Contact the schools you are considering to learn more about their specific language politics.\n\nDu har ikke bestilt nogen kataloger\nLuk kurven",

New spots continue to become available.\n\nPrometric has announced that safety measures will be in place when test centers reopen. Candidates sitting for exams will need to follow guidelines that comply with local and federal mandates, such as social distancing at exam centers, and wearing a face mask and gloves. FINRA is currently reviewing online testing options; more information on the roll-out of remote testing is pending.\n\nTo help candidates stay engaged while preparing for their exams, Knopman Marks is offering free live-streaming review sessions for the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) Exam, the Series 7 Exam, and the Series 24 Exam.\n\nExam Scheduling FAQs\n\n  1. Our registration department booked group exam dates many months ago. Will those exam seats be cancelled?\n    Prometric has social distancing policies in place through June 30. This includes seating candidates in every other seat. If Prometric extends those social distancing practices throughout the summer, it is reasonable to expect that some previously booked exam seats will be cancelled.\n  2. When we book group exam seats with Prometric, U4s must be submitted at least 14 days before candidates schedule the exam. Does that 14-day rule apply when candidates schedule on their own?\n    No, when exams are booked outside the group-booking process, the test can be scheduled as soon as the U4 is submitted and the exam window is opened. For example, if the window is opened on Tuesday, the exam could be scheduled for a date as early as the next day.\n  3. Once a candidate submits a U4 to the registration team, how long will it take until their window is open?\n    This varies depending on your registration team\u2019s bandwidth and the size of your training program. Also, if a candidate makes an error on the form and is unresponsive when the registration team requests more information, this will slow down the process. The best practice here is to require candidates to submit their U4s on the very first day of training to allow your colleagues in registration as much runway as possible to work through the paperwork.\n  4. What if a candidate is unable to find availability on the day we ask them to take an exam (e.g., Series 79)?\n    Our expectation this summer is that candidates in a class will not all take the exam on the same day. We suggest offering a range of dates. For example, rather than asking them to schedule for August 3, encourage them to look for an exam slot between July 31 and August 5.\n  5. What if we give candidates a range (like you suggest above) but the earliest available exam date in their location is after that, and other technical training and training for other exams (e.g., Series 63) is happening in the interim?\n    That\u2019s OK too. Throughout the year, we work with candidates who attend training and then end up not taking the exam for another 2 to 3 weeks or longer. We expect that, this summer, candidates will have longer gaps between training and the exam. We\u2019ll work with them to help them stay exam ready even while they have other training obligations in between.\n  6. How will it work if candidates go through SIE training but can\u2019t take the exam until after Series 7 training?\n    We\u2019re prepared for the possibility that candidates will train for multiple exams before taking any exams. We\u2019ll provide guidance on how they can maintain exam readiness for two (or even three) exams at that same time. This is something we do regularly throughout the year, and as such, it\u2019s not a new process for us.\n  7. I have a large training program and am concerned about the logistics of asking hundreds of candidates to be responsible for exam scheduling on their own. How will this work?\n    We\u2019re planning to provide logistical support to you and your registration departments in this effort. This includes: reminding trainees to submit U4s as quickly as possible, following up with them to understand their scheduling status, and updating the firm as needed. The administrative effort to help a large group of candidates schedule on their own is significant, but we\u2019re well prepared to meet that challenge.\n  8. If we have a number of candidates who end up testing a few weeks after training, how will this impact the overall pass rate?\n    Throughout the year, most of our clients do not take the exam for a number of weeks after the class. We do not expect any impact on the pass rate. Using our LMS (learning management system), we are aware of each scheduled exam date for the candidate; our system will automatically push out relevant feedback and rule changes, and our faculty will ping trainees as needed.\n  9. How can I track the study progress of candidates who end up taking the exam a week or two after training?\n    Our manager reporting dashboard offers real-time updates, including practice scores, number of questions completed, and exam readiness, for every candidate in your program. It also includes a helpful filter by exam date so you can review only the candidates scheduled to test, for example, next week.\n  10. Can my candidates all take the exams online?\n    FINRA is currently validating online testing procedures, and we hope to have more information about this initiative in May. What we do know is that the initial roll out will apply to the following exams: SIE, Series 6, Series 7, 63, 65, and 66. Our current expectation for this summer is that all other exams will be available only at Prometric testing centers. If that changes, we\u2019ll let you know.\n\nKnopman Marks Classes Are Live-Streaming\n\nAll Knopman Marks classes moved from in-person to virtual (live-streaming) through the end of June to help minimize potential exposure to the coronavirus. Stay up to date with Knopman Marks\u2019 COVID-19 contingency resource center here. More information from Prometric is available here.\n\nPresident, Head of Performance, Faculty.

The NELC major requires two years of one language and then other advanced courses or courses in English that focus on the culture of the primary language. The major is not titled \"Arabic, \"Persian,\" etc., but the NELC major is the equivalent of such a title.\n\nWhat languages does the Near Eastern Languages and Civilization department teach?\n\nWe teach Arabic, Biblical and Modern Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, Uighur, and Uzbek regularly. We also offer Akkadian, Aramaic, Egyptian (Coptic), Ugaritic, Kazakh, and Tajik at various times. For a current listing of courses please consult the course catalog.\n\nWhat degree programs are offered within Near Eastern Languages and Civilization?\n\nUndergraduate students: Major or Minor in NELC\n\nGraduate students: Master of Arts in NELC\n\nDoctoral students: NELC does not have a Ph.D. program. Those seeking study leading to a Ph.D. should consider the Ph.D. Interdisciplinary Program in Near and Middle Eastern Studies\n\nHow can I declare NELC as my major?\n\nThe Near Eastern Languages and Civilization major has an open declaration for anyone in good university standing (not on probation). Students must meet with the NELC Advisor to fill out the Change of Major form. The advisor can explain the various degree tracks offered within NELC or the student can explore the four options here.\n\nIf I took language courses elsewhere, how can I enroll in a course mid-sequence?\n\nAll students must be evaluated before they are allowed to enroll in language courses beyond the first quarter, introductory level course. Each language has a different evaluation process, which may include meeting with a professor for evaluation or taking a placement test. Please see the Course Restrictions page and\/or contact the NELC Advisor for details about a specific language\u2019s evaluation process.\n\nHow are the language programs in NELC structured?\n\nLanguage courses are taught at the elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels, depending on the language. Each level is a made up of a three-quarter course sequence. The first course for each level is taught Autumn quarter. Students with no prior knowledge of the language must begin in the Autumn quarter. All NELC language courses are 400-level courses. The 41x-level elementary language courses are designed for students without any prior knowledge of the language. Freshmen and sophomores are encouraged to begin language courses early to move through the sequences in a timely manner.\n\nHow do I get an add code for a NELC course?\n\nEach course may distribute add codes differently. Check the Time Schedule for instructions to obtain an add code. For courses with \u201cadd code only\u201d restrictions, contact the Undergraduate Advisor if the Time Schedule does not indicate otherwise. For courses with a full enrollment please consult the instructor teaching the course.\n\nHow do I take a placement exam?\n\nThe placement exams are conducted and administered by the University of Washington Office of Educational Assessment (OEA). The OEA is in Schmitz Hall on campus. To find out more about how to get there, and how to register for a test, please click here. Students should check with the Testing Center before going to take a test. For information about specific language placement tests, click here.\n\nIf I am a native speaker in a NELC language, may I enroll in and receive credit for language courses in my native tongue?\n\nNative speakers are never allowed to enroll in language courses at the beginning or intermediate levels. Students should meet with the language professor to determine if they may enroll in advanced language courses as each language and situation varies. Native speakers are permitted to enroll in advanced literature courses for their native language.\n\nIf I am a native speaker in a NELC language, may I enroll in NELC\u2019s M.A. program and use my native tongue as my primary language of study?\n\nYes. Native speakers are still required to take an M.A. exam in that language, and the advisory committee will decide what the nature of that exam will be. The exam may involve knowledge of grammar and\/or an ability to translate from English into the native language. It also may serve to examine that language in a specific historical period and\/or may involve other aspects of language study to be determined by a student\u2019s committee. You will be expected to demonstrate more sophisticated skills and responses for the specialization exam.\n\nCan I audit a NELC class?\n\nAuditing of NELC classes is based on the consent of the instructor and space availability. If you wish to audit in NELC, you must have written agreement from the instructor on file in the Department. Please be advised that at this time Arabic language classes (first, second and third-year Arabic) are not accepting auditors. For more information on UW policies regarding auditing, click here.\n\nMay I take a class for an S\/NS grade?\n\nIt is UW policy that students taking courses S\/NS (satisfactory\/not satisfactory) must achieve the following minimum grade to pass:\n\n\nStudents sign up for S\/NS at the time of registration. Note that credits earned with S\/NS grades will not fulfill degree or major requirements. For a full explanation on the UW policies regarding S\/NS grades click here.\nNELC graduate students who wish to receive S\/NS must receive approval to do so from the Graduate Program Advisor or the Supervisory Committee Chairperson. The NELC faculty strongly discourages the S\/NS option for graduate students.\n\nDoes NELC offer tutoring?\n\nThe NELC department does not offer tutoring. Please consult Center for Learning and Undergraduate Enrichment for information on language tutoring at the University of Washington. CLUE currently offers tutoring sessions in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish. We also recommend checking message boards around campus for tutoring opportunities.\n\nDoes NELC offer translation services?\n\nThe NELC Department does not offer translation services. However, we would happy to forward opportunities for paid translation work to graduate students with the appropriate language skills.\n\n\nRelated Links (Click to open or close)\n\nnelc logo return\n| NELC Facebook Page | Events | Contact Us | Administrative Gateway | Site Map\nMyUW | UW Emergency Alert Site |\nUW Privacy\nuw logo",
