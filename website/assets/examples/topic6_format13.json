For these new performing editions, Paul Mann has painstakingly reconstructed the music based on the finished recordings and whatever instructions were left by the composer.\n\nEach work appears in both full score and piano reduction.\u00a0\n\nThe Sun Will Shine Again is published in two separate versions, the original written for Frida in 2004 and recorded on Beyond The Notes, as well as a re-orchestrated and transposed version which Jon prepared for performances with Kasia \u0141aska in 2009. Although the song itself is identical in each case, the two versions are differently orchestrated and are therefore published side by side for ease of comparison, and to allow for use by singers with different vocal ranges.\n\nMore detailed information, together with original sleeve notes by the composer and new editorial notes by Paul Mann, are available under each listing.\n\nLook up:\nA Smile When I Shook His Hand\nThe Sun Will Shine Again\n\nFull list of Jon Lord\u2019s collected scores now\u00a0available.",
