        "text":"\"Wait... You're that talent agent from the party.\"\n\"I assure you, I am something far more ruthless than a Hollywood agent.\"\nHedy Lamarr and Damien Darhk\n\n\"Helen Hunt\" is the sixth episode of the third season of DC's Legends of Tomorrow, and the thirty-ninth episode overall. It aired on November 14, 2017.\n\n\nWhen the Legends track down an anachronism in 1930s Hollywood, they discover it's none other than a time-displaced Helen of Troy and she's just started a war between two film studios. As the Legends try to fix history and return Helen to the Bronze Age, things get complicated when they are blindsided by the appearance of a former enemy. Sara contemplates an offer she has made, which would make the Legends leave the anachronisms be. Meanwhile, Stein and Jax find themselves in an unusual predicament.[src]\n\n\n\nSpecial appearance by\n\nGuest starring\n\n\n\n\"Helen Hunt\" begins with a scene set in Hollywood in 1937 \u2014 we see in the background shots of a film creation. An \"extra\" is shouted at for not being on set in time and the chief stops creation, he figures the extra ought to be the superstar. When asked her name, she says she's Helen of Troy.\n\nOn the Waverider, Ray is dealing with isolating Stein and Jax and the investigation they're experiencing detonates. At the point when the residue settles, it's uncovered that Jax and Stein have exchanged bodies. Called to the extension, the Firestorm couple imparts to the gathering that they've exchanged bodies.\n\nSara tells the gathering that there's been a time misplacement in 1937 and the gathering heads to Hollywood. Nate, Amaya, and Zari are accomplishing recon work when Helen makes a couple of the cast individuals begin battling.\n\nOutside of the studio, Helen gets into a vehicle with Eddie Rotherberg and the pair drives away.\n\nThe group goes to a chunk of Hollywood socialites where Stein begins chatting with a youthful Hedy Lamarr \u2014 who still can't seem to act in a film when they notice Helen gets this show on the road the ball.\n\nZari utilizes her forces to make Helen spill her beverage on herself with the goal that she needs to go tidy up. Sara and Zari approach Helen in her changing area attempting to persuade her to go with them.\n\nBack outside at the ball, the gathering runs into Damien Darhk, who has been filling in as Helen's operator. Damien's brought along Kuasa, who starts conversing with Amaya.\n\nDamien and Sara leave the gathering trying to work out an arrangement that would permit Damien to keep living in 1937. While the two are talking, Nate, Mick, and Ray begin battling once again Helen, which begins spilling once again different visitors.\n\nDamien discloses to Sara that the gathering needs to back up and return to 2017 else he'll execute them all.\n\nThe gathering rendezvous on the Waverider to talk about their further plans and they conclude that Sara, Zari, and Amaya will go attempt to convince Helen to go along with them on the boat so they can get her back in time.\n\nJax and Stein keep attempting to switch the impacts of their experimentation.\n\nSara, Zari, and Amaya get to Helen's home and take out her right hand so they have direct access. They have a go at persuading her to go along with them when administrators from the two motion pictures plummet on her home and start taking shots at one another. Sara attempts to get Helen to safe spot while Zari and Amaya take out the shooters. The gathering can leave the scene with Helen.\n\nThe women return to the boat and take a stab at getting some data from Gideon when everything goes disconnected. They make the association that since Hedy Lamarr was not, at this point an on-screen character in this timespan, the mechanical advances that made Gideon didn't exist.\n\nStein, despite everything caught in Jax's body, volunteers to help find Hedy an acting line of work and leaves the Waverider to do as such. Visiting Hedy at her call community work, Stein convinces her to converse with a film official and on out of the structure, they run into Damien and Nora Darhk, who leaves them both speechless.\n\nIn the wake of discovering Jax and Stein have exchanged bodies, Damien releases Stein and Hedy since he starts giggling. Damien and Nora tracks Stein and Hedy down and starts stifling Stein when the remainder of the Legends appear.\n\nSara challenges Damien to a duel utilizing blades.\n\nBack on the Waverider, Zari and Amaya have remained behind with Helen. Zari and Amaya are hanging out in the payload straight when Kuasa, in her water structure, enters the boat and starts assaulting the pair.\n\nWhile Sara's battling Damien, Ray, Nate, and Mick take a stab at battling Nora, who can control the entirety of their forces and use them against the Legends.\n\nOn the Waverider, Kuasa is picking up the upperhand over Zari and Amaya.\n\nNora overwhelms Sara when Hedy Lamarr persuades Jax and Stein to converge into Firestorm to prevent Nora from executing Sara. Firestorm's ready to stop Damien and Nora and the two transport away from the scene.\n\nAt the point when Firestorm parts separated, Jax and Stein have come back to their own bodies.\n\nKuasa and Amaya are as yet battling about the emblem on the Waverider. Kuasa uncovers that she's Amaya's granddaughter. Helen shows up and betrays Kuasa, who at that point goes to her water structure and leaves the Waverider.\n\nHedy approaches Stein in the wake of conversing with a film executive, she's gotten her next film job.\n\nBack on the Waverider, Ray has taken Sara to the medbay where Gideon has set her in a restoratively instigated trance like state to recuperate throughout the following not many days.\n\nZari is conversing with Helen, who despite everything has a go at persuading her to not put her back in the exact timeframe. Zari discovers that Helen vanishing didn't influence the course of events so she's ready to assume here to a position other than Troy. To keep her safe, Zari drops off Helen on none other the Themyscira.\n\n\n\n\nPreparation ran from August 23 until August 31, 2017. Shooting began on September 1 and ran until September 14, 2017.[1]\n\n\n  \u2022 The episode title \"Helen Hunt\" has two meanings. The first is the hunt for Helen of Troy and the other is the name of a popular actress, tying into the Hollywood setting of the episode.\n  \u2022 Sara says, \"must be Tuesday\" upon learning Martin and Jax switched bodies. This is a pun on the phrase \"must be Tuesday\", which refers to something crazy or strange that occurred, but is actually a common occurrence in one's everyday life, as well as referencing the day of the week which Season 3 episodes of DC's Legends of Tomorrow aired.\n  \u2022 Martin scolds Jax, claiming that the oldest movie he's seen is the 1984 film Police Academy.\n  \u2022 Martin expresses his belief that the 1942 film Casablanca is nothing without Ingrid Bergman (who portrayed Ilsa Lund) and the 1940 film The Philadelphia Story is nothing without Katharine Hepburn (who portrayed Tracy Lord).\n  \u2022 Martin and Jax switching bodies is an homage to the novel Freaky Friday and its various adaptations, itself referenced by Ray and Jax.\n  \u2022 When discussing Hedy Lamarr, Jax-in-Stein comments that Stein-in-Jax was interested in \"doing the nasty in the pasty\", a reference to a scenario in the Futurama episode \"Roswell That Ends Well\", where series protagonist Philip J. Fry inadvertently became his own grandfather during a trip back to Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.\n  \u2022 As Nora is about to kill Sara, she exclaims, \"Bye bye, birdie\", referencing the musical of the same name.\n  \u2022 This episode marks the first appearance of Themyscira in the Arrowverse, which is the home of the DC Comics female superhero Wonder Woman.\n  \u2022 Themyscira is portrayed with the famous view of Navagio Beach on Zakynthos Island, Greece.\n  \u2022 Hedy Lamarr invented Frequency-hopping spread spectrum, the technology used in wireless communications (smart\/cell phones).\n    \u2022 She worked briefly as a telephone operator before making her big break in Hollywood, allowing her to patent her technology, which (among other things) allowed the invention of the cell phone. Sadly she never earned any money from her invention because by the time anyone used it her patent had expired. Our modern world would not be possible without her invention, which she created during WWII to use in torpedo's so they could not be tracked or jammed. She was not taken seriously(because she was a Woman) by the military brass and her tech was not used in the torpedo until years later after WWII. The Idea was based on the same concept that makes a player piano work. Hedy Lamarr was a genius.\n  \u2022 When Hedy tells Jefferson and Stein to merge, she calls Firestorm \"Nuclear Man\", referencing the episode of the same name in Season 1 of The Flash\u200b, which marked the debut of Firestorm.\n  \u2022 The episode mainly takes place at Warner Bros. Pictures Studios. Warner Bros Pictures owns DC Comics.\n\n\n  \u2022 At the K&G party, Nate mispronounces Cecil B. DeMille's name; it's \"Sess-ill\", not \"See-sill\".\n  \u2022 Sara's hair at the party when Dahrk arrives goes from slightly curly\/wavy to very curly, then back to slightly curly\/wavy. This is most noticeable before and after she and Zari confront Helen.\n\n\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.",

        "text":"Adventure Time with Finn and Jake Wiki\n\nThe Fool\n\n2,818pages on\nthis wiki\nAdd New Page\nTalk0 Share\n\nThe Fool was a vampire gnome and a member of the Vampire King's court.\n\n\nMarceline fought The Fool centuries ago when she was on a mission to protect the remaining humans from vampires. While most vampires are malevolent, The Fool is more of a mischievous child; in one of his witless misadventures, he lost one of his fangs to a box turtle. Despite this, he is still a vampire which means he subsists on human blood. He is one of the first vampires Marceline ever targeted, and while she hunted him with deadly earnest, he regarded the whole thing as a game of tag. Marceline managed to defeat him and gain his power of flight and levitation.\n\nThe vampires are resurrected after Princess Bubblegum removes Marceline's vampire essence from her. After a short period, the Vampire King and his court manifest. While the other members of the vampire court debate what to do, The Fool proposes taking things easy, suggesting that they just get an apartment. Most of the court part ways with the group, but The Fool hangs around with the king.\n\nThe Fool is the first vampire Marceline kills in stakes in Vamps About. Marceline dispatches with him with absolutely no effort. The Fool casually shrugs off being stabbed in his usual carefree fashion.\n\n\nThe Fool has the body of a gnome with long, noodly limbs on a short, round frame. He has a Petit Goatee style beard, a single fang, light blue eyes with diamond-shaped pupils, and dresses barefoot with a grey, long-sleeved shirt, dark, navy pants dress, and a similarly colored pointy hat.\n\n\nAs a vampire with magical powers, the Fool can levitate and fly by his own means.\n\n\n  \u2022 He is named after the unnumbered trump or Major Arcana card in traditional Tarot decks. The Fool card represents innocence, spontaneity, and free-spiritedness. Similarly, Fool behaves like an incautious, carefree child. In the reversed position, the card can represent recklessness or a disregard obvious dangers, which is what leads to the eponymous vampire's downfall.\n  \u2022 He is seen playing a bongo with the others in \"Vamps About\"\n  \u2022 Jake describes him looking as if \"a baby snake was a baby baby\".\n  \u2022 The Fool had both his fangs when he was revived, but the Vampire King ripped it out of his mouth.\n  \u2022 He is the only vampire not to be encountered by Finn and Bonnibel, as well as the only vampire to stay with the Vampire King.\n\nAd blocker interference detected!\n\nWikia is a free-to-use site that makes money from advertising.

        "text":"Team Four Star Wiki\n\nThe History of Trunks is the third special of Dragon Ball Z Abridged produced by Team Four Star and released on March 19, 2015.\n\n\nTrunks introduces himself and starts to explain his story. Trunks is still a baby and is in Bulma's arms crying. Gohan runs into a room with Chi-Chi, Ox-King, and Master Roshi. Chi-Chi says that Goku is dead for good, which makes Gohan scream. Trunks then says \"Dad dead, dad dead\" as a baby. Vegeta says \"Son of a bitch!\", Trunks repeats him.\n\nGoku's friends mourn his death for six months until the androids kill all of them. After the intro screen, it shows a normal town going about its business, until the androids attack. A radio station was saying what town was being attacked but Bulma changes the station.\n\nA younger Trunks realizes that the town is close and wants to help them out. Bulma disproves of this and says that she doesn't want him dead. Trunks ignores her and flies off to the city.\n\nThe Androids continue to attack the city. Trunks finally gets there but it is too late. The city is destroyed and in ruins. He wanders the city until he hears someone flying. Future Gohan appeared and Trunks stares in awe. Narrating, Trunks says, \"Face to face to him, all I could say was,\" Then his younger self-starts talking fast and in a baby voice in front of Gohan.\n\nTrunks and Gohan are in Trunks\u2019 house talking. Gohan then say that Trunks will be his pupil from then on. Bulma comes back with some groceries. She says hi to Gohan and then tries to sleep with him, to which he \"initially\" turned down due to Trunks being present. \"Worth a shot\" Bulma replies and makes dinner (Note: that in an alternate universe Future Gohan complied with Future Bulma and entered a relationship). Bulma tries to create small talk but Gohan replies with \"Can't talk, eating.\" and starts stuffing his face, causing Bulma to say that he's just like his dad, in which Gohan replies \"In what regard?\", with his mouth full. Bulma then says that he's strong, brave, and how he looks in his gi (the Canadian subtitles add that he has a TARDIS for a stomach). Gohan replies that it was the only thing Goku left him, Bulma thinking of it as sweet.\n\nIt then cuts to Trunks and Gohan training. Most of the training is to make Trunks a Super Saiyan like Gohan, though it was mostly \"dodgy\". Gohan notes he might be rough on Trunks, but it's nowhere as how Piccolo treated him during training. Despite that, however, he still looks up to him as the father he never had. Trunks then asks about Vegeta since Bulma never talks about him, which Gohan states that Vegeta had a lot to prove (after remembering a flashback where Vegeta beat up Gohan after Goku went Super Saiyan and thought Gohan was better than him). Gohan has also cut all contacts with Chi-Chi and Ox-King, the former suffering from sanity slippage from all that's happened. Gohan continues to push Trunks and is happy with the results showing. Piccolo (in Gohan's mind) believes the best training is on the battlefield, which Gohan agrees with.\n\nThe next day, Androids 17 and 18 attack Super World while having fun with the rides at the same time. Gohan and Trunks arrive and confront the androids. Gohan powers up into Super Saiyan and tells Trunks to watch until he's overmatched. Trunks is amazed at the intensity the fight and joins the fight when Gohan starts to get overmatched. Trunk, however, gets overpowered due to his inexperience, but before he's killed by 18, Gohan saves him. The androids blast everywhere but can't find the two due to them unable to sense their energy. They nuke the place up with \"Scorched Earth\" and leave. Gohan awakens and finds himself badly injured, and see's that he lost an arm. He tries to give him and Trunks Senzu Beans, but unfortunately, finds there's only one left.\n\nAfter recovering at Bulma's, Trunks continues his training to become a Super Saiyan, but is getting nowhere. Gohan believes he's getting closer but is lacking the right push. Gohan explains that he uses the pain of loss in order to transform, remembering the deaths of Piccolo and Krillin (but not Goku, though Trunks brings it up). The androids attack a nearby city, and Gohan powers up to fight them. Trunks wants to come help, but is knocked out by Gohan for his own protection. While destroying the city, 17 admits he's getting bored of destroying the world and wants to become a park ranger. However, Gohan kicks him into a building and fights the androids even without an arm. Unfortunately, he's outmatched and is killed by the androids. In his last moments, he tells Piccolo that even with him gone, Trunks will rise and avenge him, though Piccolo reminds him that he's only a figment of his imagination and not really in his head. Trunks wakes up and heads to the city, finding through the wreckage Gohan's corpse. Sadden and angry over the loss of his mentor, Trunks unlocks his Super Saiyan powers.\n\nThree years later, Trunks and Bulma are hard at work on the Time Machine when they hear a radio distress call about the androids attacking. Trunks and Bulma have an argument on whether he should wait for the time machine to be finished, or fight the androids, but Trunks is confident now that he's a Super Saiyan. He leaves off on his own and confronts the androids. But despite his best efforts, he's unable to defeat them. The androids realize that he's the kid from three years ago and taunt him saying that no one will stop them. Not the Z-Fighters, not Gohan, and not him. Trunks is beaten badly and depowers from Super Saiyan form, but before 17 blows him up, 18 steps in the way wanting the kill. 18 takes the full blast, and angrily takes 17 out of the wreckage. Trunks survives the encounter, admitting he still has no idea how, and wakes up in bed with Bulma at his side. She gives him two choices, either fight the androids again, or use the now completed time machine and go rescue Goku and the others. Trunks picks the second choice, mumbling it at first, when Bulma asks him again, he then says it out loud\n\nA few months later, a recovered Trunks sets out to the past eager to see Goku and Vegeta (much to Bulma's fear of the latter). He promises that when he comes back, it will be an android free world. Trunks soon travels to the past. After Trunks disappears, Bulma, unfortunately, realizes that the universe works in multiverse theory. \"Shit!\"\n\nIn a post-credit\u2019s scene, Oolong peeks through a periscope onto Kame House, which is ransacked and abandoned, and says the Androids haven't been back in two days, which Master Roshi couldn't believe they actually took it. Oolong wants to make a food run, but all that's left is spam and pork rinds, which he's already made peace with since he's just glad they're still alive, thanks to Roshi's submarine, the U.S.S. M'Dick. Roshi then asks the others how it feels \"riding M'Dick,\" which Oolong rants he's been holding onto that question for 17 years. After Roshi says his patience was worth it, he still demands an answer, which Oolong replied, \"it's tight and damp,\" Roshi cackles as Puar laments they're going to die in there.\n\n\n  \u2022 This special is dedicated to Monty Oum, the Creator & Founder of the Web series RWBY from Rooster Teeth who died a month earlier from an allergic reaction. TFS had planned to have him voice Future Gohan.\n  \u2022 There was an alternate scene where Gohan would have sex with Bulma like Vegeta (replace the Galick Gun with the Masenko)\n    \u2022 Takahata101 admits to being the one who came up with the Gohan and Bulma sex scene. He admitted on Twitter that he held up a scripting session for an hour determined to make the scene into the movie.\n  \u2022 This special was originally planned for release in February. However, because of KaiserNeko's illness, it was pushed back. It's also considered at the time to be the biggest project Team Four Star has ever worked on for the show.\n    \u2022 When it became clear they were going to miss the February deadline they considered breaking it into two parts to get part one out during February and part two later on. They decided against this in the end.\n  \u2022 When Bulma feeds Gohan, she says to not ask where she gets the protein from to use in the food. This implies she's using her mother's clones from the sub-lab as the protein base, similar to when Yajirobe was eating them in Percussive Maintenance.\n  \u2022 While training Trunks, Gohan enacts several recurring gags seen when Piccolo was training him as a child, such as \"FLY UP!\", a reference to Piccolo's \"CLIMB DOWN!\" and the infamous \"DODGE!\" scream.\n  \u2022 In a nod to the episode, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Saiyan, Vegeta's yell is heard in the scene before Trunks leaves to fight the androids. However, it's changed from Trunks waiting patiently and noticing the scream, to him arguing with his mother and not hearing it. This can be interpreted as evidence of the multiverse theory.\n  \u2022 Since Yamcha isn't alive in this timeline, all his parts were heavily edited out, such as replacing him with Yajirobe when the group is standing outside of Goku's home in the beginning. This can be interpreted as evidence of multiverse theory.\n  \u2022 This is the only DragonBall Z Abridged product that doesn't have the Disclaimer at the start of the video. This was due to the fact it started with a Dedication card at the beginning.\n  \u2022 This special is considered to by most as the darkest and most dramatic of all of DragonBall Z Abridged.\n  \u2022 Dr. Briefs is not credited, despite speaking in the movie.\n  \u2022 During the \"T.J. and The Wombat\" sequence, the female moan sound effect was voiced by Amber Lee Connors.\n  \u2022 This is the first time Piccolo calls Makank\u014dsapp\u014d by it's real name, unlike in Episode 2 where he can't pronounce it\n    \u2022 However it's stated that he's only in Gohan's head and that he isn't actually there\n  \u2022 Doctor Who is heavily used for the time travel part, especially the credits, which are a remix of the Doctor Who theme and Cha-La. It even shows the Time Machine falling through a ... (truncated)",

The name would later be shortened to the '101 All Stars' and finally just the '101ers'. The group played at free festivals such as Stonehenge, and established themselves on the London pub rock circuit prior to the advent of punk.\n\n\nThe group was named after the squat where they lived together: 101 Walterton Road, Maida Vale, although it was for a time rumoured that they were named for \"Room 101\", the infamous torture room in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\nThe band's early gigs included several at the Windsor Castle and a residency at the Elgin.[3] They were supported by the Sex Pistols at the Nashville Room on 3 April 1976; this is when Strummer claimed he saw the light and got involved in the punk scene.[1] Joe Strummer commented on this event in the Don Letts documentary Westway to the World on the end of the 101ers by saying \"5 seconds into their (the Pistols') first song, I knew we were like yesterday's paper, we were over.\"[1]\n\nBy the time their debut single, \"Keys to Your Heart\", was released, Joe Strummer was in The Clash and the band were no more.[2] Clive Timperley later joined The Passions, Dan Kelleher went to Martian Schoolgirls and The Derelicts.[2] Richard Dudanski went on to work with The Raincoats, Basement 5 and Public Image Ltd.[2] Tymon Dogg worked with Strummer briefly in The Clash, playing fiddle and singing his original song, \"Lose This Skin\", on Sandinista!, and later in The Mescaleros.\n\nI know the 101ers were good. In fact, as far as sound and excitement went we were much better than Eddie and the Hot Rods. The other guys in the group were twenty-five and twenty-six and they played good because they'd spent a few years getting that far. But they were just too old. What I really wanted was to get in with some young yobbo's who I was more in tune with.\n\nThe 101ers' recorded output was initially limited to one single. However, by 1981, interest in The Clash was at its height and a second single and a compilation album Elgin Avenue Breakdown was released.[2] Several of the tracks on the latter album were live recordings, and there is no evidence that the band ever conceived of these recordings as a full-length album.\n\nUntil his death in 2002, Joe Strummer had been planning to re-release Elgin Avenue Breakdown, complete with previously unreleased tracks that would encompass everything the band ever recorded.[citation needed] The project was completed with the help of Strummer's widow Lucinda Tait and former drummer Richard Dudanski, and released in May 2005 as Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited via Astralwerks in the US and EMI in Europe. The last track on the 2005 re-issue was an 8-minute version of \"Gloria\" recorded on 22 May 1976 at the Cellar Club in Bracknell. This was recorded two weeks before the 101ers finally split.[5] Joe Strummer joined The Clash who played their first gig at the Black Swan, Sheffield supporting the Sex Pistols on 4 July 1976.\n\n\nThe Clash had played \"Keys to Your Heart\" live at around the same time it was reissued as a single. The Hypertonics have also covered this song.[6]\n\nBand line-up[edit]\n\n  \u2022 John \"Woody\" Mellor aka Joe Strummer \u2013 Guitar, vocals\n  \u2022 Clive Timperley \u2013 Guitar, vocals\n  \u2022 Dan Kelleher \u2013 Bass, guitar, vocals\n  \u2022 Richard Dudanski \u2013 Drums\n  \u2022 Simon Cassell aka \"Big John\" \u2013 Saxophone\n  \u2022 Alvaro Pe\u00f1a-Rojas \u2013 Saxophone\n  \u2022 Marwood Chesterton aka \"Mole\" \u2013 Bass guitar (until Oct. 1975)\n  \u2022 Antonio Narvaez \u2013 Drums\n  \u2022 Julian Yewdall \u2013 Vocals, harmonica\n  \u2022 Patrick Nother \u2013 Bass (1st gig)\n  \u2022 Martin Stone \u2013 Lead guitar (final gig)\n  \u2022 Tymon Dogg \u2013 Fiddle, vocals\n\n\n\n  \u2022 \"Keys to Your Heart\" (Joe Strummer) b\/w \"5 Star Rock & Roll Petrol\" (Strummer, Dan Kelleher) (Chiswick\/Big Beat 1976)\n  \u2022 \"Sweet Revenge\" b\/w \"Rabies\" (Chiswick 1981)\n\n\n  \u2022 Elgin Avenue Breakdown Andalucia AND101 (1981)\n  \u2022 Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited Astralwerks ASW32161 \/ EMI 474460 2 (2005)\n  \u2022 Five Star Rock'n'Roll Made In Heaven 362020 (1993) [7]\n\n\n  1. ^ a b c Westway 2001.\n  2. ^ a b c d e Strong 2003, p.\u00a0109.\n  3. ^ Don J Whistance. \"Early gigs\".

        "text":"Many HeavyMetal fans and musicians seem to agree that in their genre, lyrics don't matter very much - or rather, that how the lyrics ''sound'' is a lot more important than what the lyrics ''mean''. Thus, a lot of HeavyMetal music has generic, largely meaningless lyrics. Common themes (with some of their standard words) for Mad Lib Metal Lyrics include:\n\n* Religion and [[RockMeAsmodeus Satanism]] in particular: [[CaptainObvious 'Satan']], 'Antichrist', 'damnation', 'Hell', 'sin', 'Sodom', 'Gomorra', and [[Literature\/TheBible biblical]] references in general.\n** Usually found in: BlackMetal, DeathMetal, ThrashMetal, HeavyMetal\n* BodyHorror and {{Gorn}}: 'Body', 'organs', 'flesh', 'ripping', 'corpse', 'blood'.\n** Usually found in: DeathMetal, {{Grindcore}}[[note]]Of the goregrind variety.[[\/note]]\n* HeavyMeta: [[CaptainObvious 'metal']], 'rock', 'guitar', [[HellBentForLeather 'leather']], and a lot of references to [[CoolPeopleRebelAgainstAuthority youthful rebellion]].\n** Usually found in: HeavyMetal, PowerMetal, HairMetal\n* Psychopathy: 'insane', 'voices', 'mind', 'in [my\/your\/his] head'. A lot of overlap with {{Angst}} below.\n** Usually found in: ProgressiveMetal, NuMetal, MelodicDeathMetal, ThrashMetal\n* Warfare (modern): 'napalm', 'machine gun', 'total war', 'nuclear', 'holocaust'.\n** Usually found in: ThrashMetal, HeavyMetal\n* Warfare (ancient): 'hero', 'warrior', 'sword', 'shield', 'honour', 'kingdom', 'battle'. Overlaps with...\n** Usually found in: PowerMetal, HeavyMetal, FolkMetal\n* HeavyMithril: 'dragon', 'beast', 'quest', 'prophecy', '[mythological figure]'\n** Usually found in: PowerMetal, SymphonicMetal, FolkMetal, BlackMetal\n* RatedMForManly \/ TestosteronePoisoning: 'strong', 'power', 'stand', 'rise', 'true', 'destroy', 'burning', 'almighty'\n** Usually found in: GrooveMetal, {{Metalcore}}, ThrashMetal, DeathMetal, HeavyMetal, BlackMetal\n* {{Angst}}: 'pain', 'scars\", 'hell', 'bottom', 'hollow', 'hate', 'hurt', 'inside', 'bleed', 'alone', 'sorrow'\n** Usually found in: NuMetal, DoomMetal, MelodicDeathMetal, ThrashMetal, {{Metalcore}}\n\nNote that, except HeavyMeta, all these themes have violence, death and [[WorldOfHam hamminess]] in common. Also, metal lyrics about any of these themes are not necessarily Mad Lib Metal Lyrics - this trope is about ''generic'' and ''meaningless'' metal lyrics.\n\nThe popularity of different themes varies across metal subgenres: the \"traditional\" metal of the [[TheSeventies late seventies]] and [[TheEighties early eighties]] mostly uses HeavyMeta. ThrashMetal loves modern warfare [[note]]no, not [[VideoGame\/ModernWarfare the game trilogy]][[\/note]], as well as Satanism (but not as much as BlackMetal) and {{Gorn}} (but not as much as DeathMetal). Ancient warfare and HeavyMithril mostly show up in PowerMetal and FolkMetal.\n\nThis trope is about lyrics, but the same pattern often shows up in band, album and song names.\n\n'''[[TropesAreTools This is not necessarily a bad thing.]]''' Many {{Metal Head}}s will freely admit that their favourite bands' lyrics aren't very original or thought-provoking, but still enjoy the music a lot; as stated before, many just don't think lyrics are very important.\n\nOf course, while the fans generally don't pay much attention to Mad Lib Metal Lyrics, MoralGuardians often do - and then have a heart attack.\n\nCompare WordSaladLyrics, which mean even less, but pretend to mean more.\n\nThis trope's examples are far too numerous to list; a few examples for explanatory purposes will do.\n\n\n* Too many songs by Music\/{{Venom}} to list.\n* A lot of Music\/{{Slayer}} songs, including \"The Antichrist\".\n* BlackMetal\n\n[[AC:Religious Imagery]]\n* \"Creeping Death\" by Music\/{{Metallica}}\n* \"Black Sabbath\" and \"After Forever\" by Music\/BlackSabbath\n\n* \"Ripping Corpse\" by Kreator.\n* \"Necrophobic\" by Music\/{{Slayer}}.\n* Anything by CannibalCorpse.\n* A lot of early Music\/{{Dismember}}, particularly \"Skin Her Alive\".\n\n* Music\/{{Metallica}} usually averts Mad Lib Metal Lyrics, but \"Metal Militia\" is a fine example of this trope.\n* A lot of Saxon songs, most notably \"Heavy Metal Thunder\".\n* \"Black Metal\" (the [[BlackMetal genre's]] TropeNamer) by Music\/{{Venom}}.\n* Music\/NanowarOfSteel sometimes parodied this with weakly linked, but [[LargeHam strongly screamed]] lines, using either Metal or HeavyMithril themes -- up to a ListSong of metals and alloys.\n* Metallica's ''No Life 'til Leather'', presumably a snowclone of Motorhead's ''No Sleep 'til Hammersmith''.\n* Most of the songs from {{Sabaton}}'s [[EarlyInstallmentWeirdness first album]].\n\n* \"Criminally Insane\" and \"Dead Skin Mask\" by Music\/{{Slayer}}.\n* \"Schizoid\" by Music\/{{Venom}}.\n* \"Sweating Bullets\" by Music\/{{Megadeth}}.\n* Music\/{{Metallica}} has many, be a SanitySlippageSong (\"Harvester of Sorrow\") or songs that also fit the Angst field above (most of ''Death Magnetic'').\n\n[[AC:Modern warfare]]\n* \"Fire In The Sky\" by Saxon.\n* \"Chemical Warfare\" by Music\/{{Slayer}}.\n* \"Disposable Heroes\" and \"No Remorse\" by Music\/{{Metallica}}\n* Most of {{Sabaton}}'s catalog.\n\n[[AC:Ancient warfare]]\n* Most songs by Music\/DragonForce; it would be shorter to list the songs that aren't.\n* \"Blood Is The Price Of Glory\" and \"Victory Song\" by Music\/{{Ensiferum}}.\n* Almost all of Music\/AmonAmarth's songs are about Vikings. Some of them are even based on real events like conquering Ireland.\n* It'd probably be easier to list FolkMetal bands which do not indulge in this, than those that do.\n\n* \"Deathbringer From The Sky\" by Music\/{{Ensiferum}}.\n* Anything by {{Manowar}} based on Norse mythology that isn't HeavyMeta.",
