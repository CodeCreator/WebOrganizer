        "text":"Sunday, 21 February 2016\n\nSuperdrug Flirty Exotic Fruits and White Chocolate Body Spray\n\nFor Christmas I had asked for body sprays and perfumes because I was running seriously low on them and needed to stock up. I don't know about you, but I feel anxious going out without any on! One of the sprays I\u00a0received\u00a0was the Superdrug 'Flirty Exotic Fruits & White\u00a0Chocolate' body spray. Quite frankly I don't know what is so flirty about spray but I gave it ago nevertheless.\n\nThere are pros and cons to this body spray. One pro is that it does smell really nice! I'm not so sure about the 'exotic fruits' but the white chocolate really comes through in the smell which even my boyfriend noticed. I certainly don't mind smelling of chocolate! Another pro is the price: \u00a31.29, but currently at sale price of 63p! So if you are someone who is on a budget this is definitely handy.\n\nHowever, a big con is that the smell doesn't last very long. It probably lasts about an hour if that, which certainly doesn't make it a long lasting body spray. To keep up the smell you would have to reapply regularly throughout the day which won't help it last a long time. It lasted about a month for me but would have lasted a much less amount of time had I taken it out with me and reapplied throughout the day.\u00a0\n\nFor the cheap price tag and the fact that it is Superdrug's own brand and not a company specified in the field of body sprays, to be honest I wasn't expecting amazing results anyway. If you're looking for something that'll last you'll most likely have to go for a slightly higher price point. But overall if you're on a budget and need something to just carry around with you then this would be an option to consider.\u00a0\n\nWhat body sprays do you use?\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

I know we haven\u2019t been on top of our NYFW postings, but here is a quick roundup of my favorites from the shows on Day 2 (Friday the 8th)\n\nRag & Bone\n\nOnce again, neutrals were the color of choice at the show. Structured jackets, updated houndstooth, and pops of color made many appearances on the runway.\n\nNicole Miller\n\nMiller\u2019s menswear inspired collection included a lot of updated basics and \u201ccool girl\u201d hats. Graphic prints and the \u201ccolor of the hour\u201d black was also showcased.\n\nCharlotte Ronson\n\nRonson credited her \u201cEnglish heritage\u201d for the inspiration behind the fall 2013 collection. \u00a0It shows, with buttoned up pieces in neutral colors.\n\n\nSuno, known for bold prints and popping colors, also seemed to stick to black in their collection. They still delivered with fun patterns in classic shapes.\n\nStay tuned for days 3&4! Photo to style.com",
