        "text":"Container Drip Irrigation Kit Buying Guide\n\nAbout Drip Depot Container Kits:\n\nDrip Depot container kits are designed to make it easy to install a professional drip irrigation system. Our kits come complete with everything you need to create a working drip irrigation system and hook it up to any standard water faucet or garden hose.\n\nWe realize that container gardening can range from a few pots on a small patio to hundreds of pots spread out over a large deck. So with that in mind we created a wide range of kits to meet all watering needs.\n\nThe following useful guide was written to help you choose the right kit for you. It will show you how to design your own drip irrigation system, gather the necessary parts and information and it will show you which kit to choose to suit your particular container gardening needs.\u00a0\n\nStep 1: Gather Information\n\nTo help ensure that you gather all the critical information needed to successfully choose and install a container drip irrigation kit we created a list of questions below that will act as an information gathering guide.\n\nQuestions to Answer:\n\n1. How many containers do you need to water?\n\nEach of our container kits come with a set number of drippers thus knowing the number of pots to be watered is very helpful in choosing the right kit.\u00a0\n\n2. How large are your containers?\n\nA good rule of thumb is that when a dripper is placed on soil with good capillary action it will create a wet zone of approximately 12 inches in diameter. If you have pots over 12 inches in diameter they most likely will need more than one dripper. Make note of any pots that will need more than one dripper.\u00a0\n\n3. How much mainline tubing do you need?\n\nThis question is extremely important for determining the right kit to choose. If you need to run tubing in a straight line over 30 feet in length then you can not use 1\u20444\u201d microtubing as your mainline tubing. Which means that you can not use kit 122 or 123 as they use 1\u20444\u201d tubing as the mainline tubing. Whether you will use 1\/4\u201d or 1\/2\u201d tubing as your mainline tubing, record the amount of mainline tubing you will need.\u00a0\n\n4. How much microtubing do you need?\u00a0\n\nIf you do not have any runs of over 30 feet then the totals for questions 3 & 4 will be combined giving you the total amount of microtubing needed. If you do have a run of tubing over 30 feet then you will need 1\/2\u201d tubing as your mainline and 1\/4\u201d micro tubing will act as your feeder lines. It is best to approximate the distance from the mainline tubing to each plant. Add up the approximate distances for each plant and this will give you a good idea of the amount of micro tubing you will need.\u00a0\n\nStep 2: Creating a sketch\n\nOnce you have answered the questions in Step 1 we recommend creating a sketch of your project area. We have found that a sketch helps to visualize the area and ensures that you have not overlooked any detail, which may result in not ordering enough parts or incorrect parts the first time. We have enclosed a sample sketch of a project to show the details that you want to provide in your sketch.\u00a0\n\nStep 3: Using your information to choose the right kit\n\nNow that you have gathered your information and created a sketch of your project area it is time to use that information to choose the best container kit for you. Below is a chart that lists the quantities of important items in each of our container kits. Start in column 1 and work your way to the right by choosing the quantity that best matches your results. When you have finished with each column look to find the kit that best matches your needs. Remember, every part we sell is available individually, so if you find a kit that is closest to your project requirements, choose it and add the parts you need.\n\nMainline Tubing-Size- amount\nCan use mainline tubing over 30ft?\n# of Con-tainers able to water\nAmount of Microtubing (1\/4\u201d)\nKit Name \/Item #\n1\/4\u201d 50ft.\nNo 30ft\/30GPH\n50 ft(mainline and microtubing are same size in this kit.

We can help! Just use the Drip Depot exclusive \u201cCustomize this drip irrigation kit\" feature.\n\nTo start: choose a container kit that is close to your design needs. This will become the template for your customized kit. Once on the item page of a kit, next to the \"add\" button you will find a \"customize\"\u00a0button. Click on the link to begin customizing your kit. Below is a short video (1:30) that will walk you through how to customize any of our drip irrigation kits.\u00a0\n\nInstallation Tips:\n\nAlthough installing your own professional drip irrigation system might sound difficult, it is actually very easy. In fact, many of our customers who were apprehensive at first, found that the installation process was very easy and took less time than they thought thanks to our kits. You don\u2019t need any specialized tools or training and we even provide a useful video tutorial that you can watch before or during the installation process. Watching the video will save you time and frustration, so check it out.\u00a0\n\nDon't forget a timer:\n\nAdding a timer to your drip irrigation system is one of those extra incurred costs that are well worth it. It reduces the time you have to put into your system by automatically turning it on and off and ensuring that you never underwater your plants.\n\nWith less human error involved, a timer can do its job of ensuring that a regular watering schedule is being adhered to and that the plants are less stressed. Studies show that a less stressed plant will deliver a much higher yield so be sure to add a timer to your drip irrigation system and watch as it pays for itself season after season. \u00a0Shop drip irrigation timers\n\nLastly, every Drip Depot kit is...\n\n\nDrip Depot kits use only the highest quality parts in every one of our kits to ensure our customers receive many years of repeated use.\n\n\nWe use Perma-loc fittings in our kits because they are durable, reusable and reliable. They offer flexibility and ease of assembly making our kits the best in the industry.\n\nBacked by a Lifetime Guarantee\n\nEvery kit Drip Depot sells is backed by a lifetime guarantee. We are confident that our kits, including the components within, will provide our customers many years of use.\n\n\nWe sell our components individually as well as in kit form. This means that you can add to your drip irrigation system at any time without having to buy new kit. Our components are in stock and ready to ship today, making Drip Depot your reliable source for drip irrigation kits, components and accessories.",
