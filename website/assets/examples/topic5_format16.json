Alternatively models for CompactPCI Serial and standard PCI Express bus are provided. Beside the obligatory isolation these boards also offer the possibility to program a digital filter per input port, e. g. for protection against bouncing. Additionally parasitic effects between field wiring and PC can be suppressed efficiently by an electrical isolation of 500 VAC RMS . 32 (ADQ-22) resp. 24 (ADQ-23) isolated digital inputs and 32 (ADQ-22) resp. 16 (ADQ-23) digital outputs are available. The streaming operation enables the continuous sampling of all digital inputs resp. streaming a bit-pattern to all digital outputs up to 1 kHz. The ADQ-23 provides 8 SPDT relays (35 V\/1 A). The isolated inputs have a Schmitt trigger characteristic according to IEC 61131-2 (type 1) and are designed for a maximum input voltage of 35 V. All isolated inputs are assembled with status LEDs and can generate an interrupt on bit-pattern change, bit-pattern match or missing external supply. The isolated outputs can drive up to 0.6 A. To increase the output current connecting the outputs in parallel is possible. This implies that no external drivers are necessary for many applications. For powering the outputs an external power supply in the range of 11..35 V with sufficient power must be provided. The output buffers come with a thermal overload protection, current limitation, short-circuit protection and an under-voltage monitoring.\n\nScope of Delivery:\n\n  \u2022 AQ-ADQ-23-cPCIs: CompactPCI-Serial 24\/16x Digital-I\/O Card\n  \u2022 D-Sub male connector\n  \u2022 Adapter cable with mounting bracket from IDC connector to D-Sub female connector\n  \u2022 Documentation and driver software\n\n\n: *\n: *\n: *\nType the characters you see in the picture:\n\nThe code is case-sensitive and must be entered exactly as above.\nAlldaq AQ-ADQ-23-cPCIs, CompactPCI-Serial 24\/16x Digital-I\/O Card\nAlldaq AQ-ADQ-23-cPCIs, CompactPCI-Serial 24\/16x Digital-I\/O Card\n\u20ac 2.088,00\nThe cookie settings on this website are adjusted to allow all cookies so that you have the very best experience.
