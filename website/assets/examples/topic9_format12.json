        "text":"Project Content\n\nEven digitalization has been a hot topic in the recent years, many of the Finnish and Lappish companies still struggle to take full advantage of the possibilities it offers. There are still plenty of room for improvement when it comes to digital sales, marketing, new types of business models and finding skilled workforce.\n\nHehku project was developed to offer solutions to these challenges. It shares knowledge, tips and lectures that are carried out in all regions of Lapland to help develop the digital business skills of our local workforce.\n\nTo broaden the bottlenecks in our digital knowledge, the project has defined these four themes:\n\n\n  \u2022 Digi Startup\n  \u2022 Digital marketing and sales\n  \u2022 Global digital resources\n  \u2022 Data and customer relationships\n\n\nThere are eight different events aimed to train and develop Lappish workforce\u2019s digital business skills. Four of them are organized in the smaller regions of Lapland and four main events are held at Rovaniemi. The regional events consist of lectures and workshops, employing remote consultants and TEQU project personnel. The events organized in Rovaniemi will each have four keynote speakers, sharing their knowledge and inspiring the participants on site.\n\nObjective of the project\n\nThe project will create targeted expertise in digital business skills for the benefit of the Lapland workforce to create new companies, acquire digital skills from global resource pools, create more digital sales and a sustainable competitive advantage through customer data management. Project boosts the growth of Lapland\u2019s and Finland\u2019s competitive advantage and promotes sustainable growth and job creation.\n\nProject implementation\n\nProject started as early as spring 2020 with the \u201cCovid19-Package\u201d, which provided six webinars on e-sales and business related to companies, as well as one network workshop to develop e-sales for SMEs in the region.\n\nYou can find the full online sales education in the form of recordings on TEQU\u2019s YouTube -channel.\n\nEducation events will continue in spring 2021.\n\nThe total budget of the project is 309 642 \u20ac, of which North Ostrobothnia Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment has admitted European Social Fund (ESF) and government funding 247 714 \u20ac.\n\nThe project will be implemented between 09.04.2020 and 31.01.2023.",

It should go without saying, but making an iconic name for ourselves is important. And we can\u2019t do that alone.\n\nIt takes dedicated partners, repeat clients, and satisfied audiences to reach a symbiotic maturity in the digital content creation business.\nAnd that\u2019s where pioneering ideas go from seed to fruition\u2026\n\nDigital Age Cozy \u2122\n\nCozies can be more than knitting grannies, cats, and cookbooks.\n\nA New Case File Opened on Cozy Mysteries:The Face of Cozy Mysteries Changes Forever\u2026\n\nMarjorie Gardens Mysteries by A.E.H. Veenman is the first series of mysteries published under the brand, Digital Age Cozy.\nAuthors\u2019 novels embody the traditional elements of the cozy mystery genre, topped off with character(s), mainly the protagonist, who rely heavily on the premise of today\u2019s technology and experts in the applied technical field to help solve crime.While common in main genres, this story structure is highly remiss with writers in the current cozy market, and makes all the difference in creating a Digital Age Cozy.With additional media and online features, these novels make for a more adventurous cozy read.\n\nThe Diversity Genre isn\u2019t a fusion of musical styles.\n\nIt\u2019s an evolution.\n\nA subgenre of Indie & Alternative, 3RD Season\u2019s music has symphonic simplicity and catchy melodies that may start out as pop\/rock or soul\u2026. Midways the song, there\u2019s a mutation.\n\nSultry vocals and tempered guitar turn loud and gritty, your expectations turned inside out. You\u2019re now listening to hard rock or punk\u2026.\n\n3RD Season strives for every song to be a journey, taking listeners from Point A to Point \u221e.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Social Marketing\n\nWe are confident in our abilities and want to share our strategies.\nOur clients\u2019 insights are our insights. And their success in reaching their audience is our greatest achievement.\n\n\u00a0 Tag & Tweet Marketing\n\nEvery author, whether traditionally- or self-published, knows the importance of marketing with an online megaphone.We\u2019re adaptive to the ever-changing face of social media and have created a big bang drum for rallying followers on Twitter called \u201cTag & Tweet\u201d. This method of growing an author\u2019s fan-base involves all the readily available features of Twitter and is used for book promotion, contests and giveaways, and blog tours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 For Mrs. A.E.H. Veenman, Exobia created her giveaway contest by orchestrating online tweets from her books\u2019 characters to instruct and entertain her followers and readers.\n\nFor 3RD Season, we invoked the use of group chats that reprint to various media, such as Storify. Not only do the band members engage with fans and fellow musicians, but they also gain inside knowledge of the music business.\n\nTheir interaction with industry professionals have proven more than useful in gaining new Twitter followers and increasing their tribe members.\n\n\nAudio Licensing\n\nIt is our pleasure to present the individual musical endeavors of 3RD Season band members for synch, mechanical, and other rights listings.\n\nFor more information, and to view our latest offerings, select \u201cLicenses\u201d in the menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELS is a legal advice agency utilizing years of corporate legal experience in the international gaming industry. ELS specializes in EU, US, UK, and Asia IP Laws and freelance\/labor laws in the European Union and United States.\n\n\n\nELS has drafted, negotiated, and executed SOW\u2019s, service, consultant, development and joint development agreements for studios and developers. Their games are being published on platforms such as Microsoft\u2019s XBLA, Sony\u2019s PS2, and PC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a published list of credits, please visit IMDB.\n\n\nAdditionally, ELS\u2019 personal experience in resource management for game studio staff (Managers and Production) can advise the best approach to hiring negotiations and draft your hiring documents.

The title coincides to the adult buyer and his or her relation to the child.\n\nThis marketing technique will help (grand)parents to locate which topic they wish to select, therefore buy the correct book.\n\nIn total, this series will begin with 20 different books.
