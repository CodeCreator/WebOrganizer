But thank you for telling me how it's actually done! Jul 16 at 12:02\n\n1 Answer 1\n\n\nThink of \u8a9e as a suffix similar to -ese (as in Japanese and Cantonese). Unlike English -ese, it can attach to almost any noun, but you're basically coining a new word that refers to a unique language by doing so. On the other hand, A\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e is a phrase that are made of several words and means \"language of A\" or \"language spoken by A\".\n\n\u72ac\u8a9e (\"dogese\") is not a word listed in a dictionary, but it can be a valid expression if dogs in your fictional work form a community and speak a distinct language. If dogs speak English and can communicate with humans using English, \u72ac\u8a9e\u306f\u82f1\u8a9e\u3060 (\"Dogese is English\") makes no sense, and you have to say something like \u3053\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u72ac\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e\u306f\u82f1\u8a9e\u3060 (\"The language of dogs in this world is English\") instead. \u672c\u8a9e (\"bookese\") may be valid if you're thinking of a fantasy world where books have a mouth and speak to one anther using a special language, but I personally have never seen a setting like this.\n\n(I also feel \u9752\u3044\u4eba is probably not what you want as the name for a specific tribe\/species, but it's a different story. You may be interested in this question.)\n\n  \u2022 That was a well-rounded answer to my question. It explained a lot.

In chapter 11\n\nChapter 11\n\nAsked by\nLast updated by jill d #170087\nAnswers 1\nAdd Yours\n\nAtticus wanted the children to understand that courage has to do with the fight for one's personal goals, no matter what the odds are against achieving the goal. Heroism consists of the fight itself, the struggle against fate, circumstance, or any other overpowering force. Mrs. Dubose's goal is to break free from her addiction to morphine. Her struggle against the clock and mortality is easily compared to Atticus's struggle to uphold his own morals despite the hopelessness of his case and the lack of support he has in town. According to Atticus's definition, he and Mrs. Dubose are both brave, even heroic, and he wants the children to follow their example. Even though Mrs. Dubose is a mean and bigoted old woman, she does have good qualities that demand respect. Atticus wants the children to see that though many of the townspeople are ignorant and racist, they also have personal strengths and are not fundamentally bad people.",

        "text":"The free dictionary gives this definition for rip on:\n\ngive someone a hard time; to hassle someone\n\nand this one for pick on:\n\nto harass or bother someone or something, usually unfairly\n\nIt sounds pretty much the same to me, but maybe there's a slight difference I don't catch?\n\n  \u2022 2\n    Could be a generation gap here but I think of bullying when I hear \"picked on\" and to me, \"rip on\" is something guys do to tease each other but it is in a joking manner, not hostile or serious. \u2013\u00a0Kristina Lopez Aug 28 '13 at 17:32\n  \u2022 I've never heard rip on. The dictionaries seem to suggest this is solely US slang. \u2013\u00a0TrevorD Aug 28 '13 at 18:36\n  \u2022 Trevor, I haven't heard it either. It is probably limited to American English. \u2013\u00a0Tristan Aug 28 '13 at 20:30\n  \u2022 I think it is fairly new here, too. It may be in another 10 years it will land at Heathrow and become part of the culture there, too. \u2013\u00a0Cyberherbalist Aug 28 '13 at 22:11\n\nPicking on someone implies merely bullying -- unfairly making fun of or harrassing someone because of something they can't help, such as their physical appearance or mannerisms. An example would be a short person being harrassed because of their physical size, or a person with a mole on their face being harrassed or made fun of because of the disfigurement. Or because of their religion or nationality, etc.\n\nRipping on someone involves severely criticizing their actions or their political positions, or even their work, such as your boss ripping on you for your bad job performance. Ripping may be fair or unfair, but it is generally directed at actions or attitudes.\n\n  \u2022 Right. They're different metaphors. Pick on is childish bullying, whereas rip on is verbal abuse (rip a new one). Both themes are perfectly coherent in practically any mix. \u2013\u00a0John Lawler Aug 28 '13 at 16:55\n  \u2022 I've found that one who is 'picked on' isn't always 'picked on' for a particular reason. There is often a given reason by the pick-er, but it is equally likely to occur for little to no reason at all, just that the individual they are 'picking on' is a preferred target. \u2013\u00a0Zibbobz Aug 28 '13 at 16:58\n  \u2022 That was my experience as well, @Zibbobz. \u2013\u00a0Cyberherbalist Aug 28 '13 at 17:01\n  \u2022 @Charles, you didn't need to delete your answer just because you thought mine was better -- there's always room for differing interpretations and points of view. In StackExchange, even the answers not Accepted can provide valuable insight. \u2013\u00a0Cyberherbalist Aug 28 '13 at 17:03\n\n\"Ripping On\" is a verbal exchange or a mocking behavior of someone, deriding them for the way they act. Specifically, to put down or belittle their way of acting.\n\n\"Picking On\" someone means to bully or harass someone. It can be that the person picking on someone else chooses to do so for the reason that they see fault in the way a person acts or behaves, but is not always the case.\n\n\"Picking On\" can also include physical violence, where \"Ripping On\" usually does not.\n\n  \u2022 In middle school (used to be called Junior High School where I lived then) I used to get picked on because I looked nerdy. The \"pickers\" never ripped on me. I got ripped on much later when my performance in Army Basic Training didn't match the Drill Sergeant's demands and expectations. \u2013\u00a0Cyberherbalist Aug 28 '13 at 16:59\n  \u2022 Picking On also doesn't have to included any form of Ripping On, though it can. As a particular example, in the movie \"Back to the Future\", the villian Biff Tannen most definitely picks on the lead character's father George McFly, and at the same time rips on him for his behavior. \u2013\u00a0Zibbobz Aug 28 '13 at 17:08\n\n\"Picked on\" can also imply something ongoing, or just a general climate of bullying or of being outcast. \"I was picked on in school\" could mean all through my school years, I was constantly the victim of bullying. (It could also mean \"I was picked on in school today.\") \"Ripped on\" is usually confined to describing a particular occurrence.\n\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
