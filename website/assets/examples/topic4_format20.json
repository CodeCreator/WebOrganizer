        "text":"2.3.5 OU multiple response\n\nAlong with the Multiple Choice question type, the Multiple Response question type is the most common form of question used in the OU's paper-based CMA system. The Multiple Response question type requires the student to choose multiple options.\n\n2.60 The Question text, mark and General feedback\n\nQuestion name: A descriptive name is sensible. This name will not be shown to students.\n\nQuestion text: You may use the full functionality of the editor to state the question.\n\nGeneral feedback: We recommend the correct answer be included in this box. Students who did not answer completely correctly can then compare and contrast to see where they made an error. The contents of this box will be shown to all students irrespective of whether their response was correct or incorrect.\n\n2.61 The available choices\n\nThe OU Multiple Response question type simplifies the authoring process by incorporating the marking scheme developed for the OU paper-based CMA system. In this marking scheme\n\n  \u2022 Choices are marked as correct or incorrect. If a question has n correct choices each correct choice is given a mark of (Question grade)\/n.\n  \u2022 If a student selects more than n choices the marks are based on the worst n choices.\n  \u2022 It follows that the number of incorrect choices should equal or exceed the number of correct choices (otherwise a student choosing all choices will receive marks).\n\nExample: A question has five choices of which only 'a' and 'b' are correct. How student responses are marked:\n\n  \u2022 a b: 100% correct\n  \u2022 a c: 50% correct\n  \u2022 a b c: 50% correct - only the two worst choices are marked\n  \u2022 a b c d: 0% correct - only the two worst choices are marked\n2.62 The Combined feedback section\n\nWhether or not Combined feedback is shown to students is governed by the Specific feedback setting on the iCMA definition form.\n\n2.63 The multiple tries section\n\nPenalty for each incorrect try: The available mark is reduced by the penalty for second and subsequent tries. In the example above a correct answer at the second try will score 0.6666667 of the available marks and a correct answer at the third try will score 0.3333334 of the available marks.\n\nIf the question is used in interactive with multiple tries mode the marking is modified as follows:\n\n  1. At each try only the worst n choices are scored.\n  2. The mark is reduced for each try by the penalty factor.\n  3. Allowance is made for when a correct response is first chosen providing it remains chosen in subsequent tries.\n\nHint: You can complete as many of these boxes as you wish. If you wish to give the student three tries at a question you will need to provide two hints. At runtime when the hints are exhausted the question will finish and the student will be given the general feedback and the question score will be calculated.\n\nClear incorrect responses: When \u2018Try again\u2019 is clicked incorrect choices are cleared.\n\nShow the\u00a0number of correct responses: Include in the feedback a statement of how many choices are correct.\n\nShow the feedback\u00a0for the selected\u00a0responses: This setting controls the feedback to individual choices however if too many choices are made it is suppressed.\n\n2.3.4 Multiple choice\n\n2.3.6 Select missing words",

(A description of Needs Assessment content is included in the Reference Section below).\u00a0 The indicators we have prepared are available at either the ZIP code or census tract level.\u00a0 Several of them are also illustrated in the maps below.\n\nTo match your ZIP code or census tract to its numerical code, see our\u00a0reference map.\n\nThe 2010 Census did not collect information on educational attainment, income, poverty, employment, vehicle availability, and other socioeconomic characteristics.\u00a0 These data were incorporated in the new American Community Survey.\u00a0 The poverty and labor force data included in your tract level indicators file come from the 2006-10 American Community Survey (ACS).\u00a0 Data at the neighborhood (census tract) level require five years of sample interviews to be combined.\u00a0 The 2006-2010 ACS file contains the most recent data available.\u00a0 No ACS data are available at the ZIP code level, however.\u00a0 While we have provided only limited information on this site, we may be developing more indicators for general context purposes and are available for specific requests.\n\nIn addition to the specific indicators we have calculated for you, we also offer our Census Comparison tool.\u00a0 This tool allows you to look at any ZIP code or census tract and track 2000 \u2013 2010 trends on all census variables, including age, race\/ethnicity, household and family composition, housing occupancy and housing tenure.\u00a0 These may come in handy when you are providing general context on the demographics of your service area.\n\n\nCensus 2010\n\nWhile we have only mapped 2010 data on single-parent households, our Census Comparison Tool allows you to find information related to all the questions asked on the Census questionnaire.\u00a0 These data will allow you to describe population trends, age distributions, the racial and ethnic context, housing trends and much more detail on the living arrangements of children.\n\nAmerican Community Survey 2006-2010\n\nSee the Data section above for information about our ACS maps.\n\nMichigan Department of Community Health\n\nThe Michigan Department of Community Health collects information related to every birth and death in the state.\u00a0 They release this information for large geographic areas \u2013 state, county and communities.\u00a0 Data Driven Detroit has acquired the individual birth record files for 2008 and 2009. (We anticipate receiving the 2010 file by September 2012.)\u00a0 We have taken these individual files and attached geographic codes to them so that we can produce information at either the ZIP Code or Census Tract level.\u00a0 Each birth record includes information on both the child (weight, level of prenatal care) and mother (age, educational level, and smoking history).\u00a0 We have utilized these data to calculate the percent of teenage births, but can provide you with additional information if you require it.\n\nEarly Development Instrument\n\n\n\nIn order to get a handle on Kindergarten Readiness (one of the measures required by the Feds for their applications), we must use results from the Early Development Instrument (EDI), developed at the Offord Centre for Child Studies at McMaster University in Canada.1\u00a0\u00a0The UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities, under license from McMaster University, is implementing the EDI in the Detroit area, in collaboration with the United Way for Southeastern Michigan (UWSEM).\n\nThe EDI has 103 core items and is an observational checklist, based on recall, that is completed by kindergarten teachers on each child in their class in the second half of the school year.\u00a0 The EDI requires approximately 10-15 minutes per child to complete.\u00a0 Information collected using the EDI is reported at a group level (e.g. for a census tract, neighborhood, city, etc) and is never reported on individual children or used as a screening or diagnostic tool for children.\n\nWe have included several documents that explain the EDI and provide test results for Southeast Michigan and Detroit.\n\nWe have mapped EDI test results by ZIP code.\u00a0 Specifically, we have mapped high-end results (Percent of Children Scoring At or Above the 75th Percentile on 4 or More Scales) and the low-end results (Percent of Children Scoring in the Lowest 10th Percentile on at Least One Scale.) \u00a0Results for each of the five domains are included in the ZIP code indicator file in the first section.\n\nThe final map we have included in this section is a market share map.\u00a0 In order to judge how representative the EDI test results are for a ZIP Code, one needs to have an understanding of the share of eligible children in that ZIP Code who were tested.\u00a0 The map shows a very wide range of coverage, from less than 1 percent to 48 percent.\u00a0 While none of these market shares would suggest particularly reliable results, shares less than 30 percent should be treated with extreme wariness.\n\n1 The tool is referred to by the publishers as the Early Development Instrument; however, in Orange County, it is referred to as the Early Development Index to reflect the community level marker of child development that is produced in the Community Profile report. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAmerican Community Survey 2007-2011\n\nAll Maps\n\n\n\n\nSee Also",

The sample table of contents, list of figures, and list of tables in Appendices D, E, and F, respectively, provide examples of suitable formats for those parts of the thesis. Appendix G provides a suitable sample format for the text of your thesis. Appendix H provides a sample thesis appendix. Appendix I provides a sample bibliography. Appendix J provides a sample reference, or literature cited, list which may be used either with, or in place of, the bibliography. (In certain scientific fields, a list of \"References\" or \"Literature Cited\" may be more appropriate than a standard \"Bibliography\". While Appendix J represents one approach, please note that lists of References or Literature Cited formats differ among various scientific fields. You should check with your thesis advisor, or refer to one of the standardized thesis preparation manuals for the format which is appropriate to your academic field.)

It is recommended that the Section Technical and Research Representative be assigned to the Papers Committee as it has been found to be helpful in promoting high quality papers and keeping members abreast of current technological advances. It is desired to have the full year\u2019s schedule developed by the beginning of the Section year for printing in October\u2019s Marine Technology and placement on the website.\n\nSome Sections have successfully followed a procedure in which an Assistant Papers Committee Chair, working with the Section Vice Chair, devotes him\/her self exclusively to the development of papers and\nprogram ideas one year in advance. He\/She then becomes Committee Chair the following year, and with the assistance of the other committee members, develops the program in detail as described. The Section Vice Chair may assume responsibility for the Papers Committee advance planning. The method of an individual or small group working a full year in advance enables the Section to develop its own program and not be forced to accept papers which are already available.\n\nA principal objective of the Society is the presentation and publishing of a broad range of materials that are of value to the profession, to the marine industry and to the general public. It is the function of the Papers Committee to select the best papers available on subjects of interest and\/or persuade eminent authorities to write such papers. Methods of determining members\u2019 interests and suggestions for developing an effective meeting are to be found in Section V-A - Program Planning Guidelines of this\nManual. The Committee should use every source available to develop papers of the highest caliber, which avoid commercialism and have the broadest appeal. Suggestions for papers, authors, or special programs are to be submitted to the Section Chair and the Executive Committee for approval. It is recognized that PowerPoint presentations are favored by many authors and, although presentations are not as desirable as a technical paper, Headquarters does have a policy to archive all such presentations, which will become accessible on the website. Electronic copies of all papers and abstracts shall be forwarded to Headquarters, both in electronic format and hard copy to make it easier for website inclusion.\n\nCoordination of the technical program is accomplished effectively by assigning one or more papers committee members to each author to assure that the papers standards are followed, and schedules and author\u2019s requirements for audio\/visual aids, etc. are satisfied. Information on Copyrights, Author's Instructions, and other technical presentation guidelines is available at Adherence to Author's Instructions is strongly encouraged.\n\nThe Papers Committee members should insist that high quality papers standards be followed, and to provide helpful suggestions to the author that will enable him\/her to write a top quality paper and make the best possible presentation. Many authors have had little experience in the development and presentation of papers, and would undoubtedly welcome help from Section members. Authors should be encouraged to discuss the topic of the paper in an extemporaneous fashion, using whatever aids\nprove effective. Papers should never be read at a technical meeting.\n\nIt is particularly important that commercialism in any form be avoided in any of the technical papers presented before any meetings of SNAME. However, it is understood that many Section papers are commercially oriented.\n\nAuthors should submit manuscripts and the copyright release form in accordance with the schedule established by the Papers Committee. The manuscripts can be submitted to other knowledgeable people for review and possible discussion.\n\nThe Committee Chair, or someone delegated by him\/her, must assume responsibility for providing the Secretary with the title, author, brief synopsis, and importance of the paper in sufficient time for inclusion in the meeting notice.",

        "text":"Technical Adequacy of Assessments\n\nTechnical Adequacy of the Progress Monitoring Passages\n\nThe following information provides evidence for the validity of the progress monitoring passages in Read Naturally Progress Monitor, based on the correlation between the monitoring passages and the benchmark passages in Read Naturally\u2019s \u00a0Reading Fluency Benchmark Assessor and Benchmark Assessor Live.\n\npointer\u00a0Learn more about Reading Fluency Progress Monitor\u00a0(Read Naturally's progress monitoring tool)\n\n\nOver the course of three school years (2002-2003, 2003-2004, and 2004-2005), Read Naturally field tested dozens of reading passages at each grade level for the purpose of continuous progress monitoring. We sent passages to classrooms throughout the country and piloted with a diversity of students. We tested students on these passages as well as on grade level benchmark passages from the Reading Fluency Benchmark Assessor and compared students' words correct per minute (WCPM) on the monitoring passages with their WCPM on the benchmark passages. Some monitoring passages were too hard for a particular grade level and some were too easy. We modified these passages and\/or tested them in a different grade. Ultimately, each passage met the benchmark passage in difficulty or we discarded it. We calibrated a total of 30 passages per grade level. The table below summarizes the results of these analyses.\n\nCorrelation and Difficulty Data\n\nThe following table lists correlation data about the progress monitoring passages compared to each other and to the grade level benchmarks. The correlation between the benchmark and monitoring passages is a measure of validity. Correlations range from -1.0 to +1.0. High correlations (.8 or higher) between the monitoring passage and the benchmark passage means that the two passages are measuring the same skill (reading fluency) with a high degree of consistency. Monitoring passages with high correlations to the benchmark and to other monitoring passages have high reliability and validity.\n\nThe table also lists data on the difficulty of the monitoring passages compared to the benchmarks. A difficulty of -2.1, for example, would indicate that the median WCPM of all students tested on the monitoring passage was 2.1 words less than their median WCPM on the benchmark passage. If the median WCPM for students on the benchmark was 50.5 and the median WCPM for students on the monitoring passage was 48.4, the difficulty on that passage would be 48.4 minus 50.5, which is -2.1.\n\nGrade (30 passages per grade) Median Correlation with Benchmark Benchmark Correlation Range Median Correlation with Other Passages Other Passage Correlation Range Median Difficulty (words correct per minute difference Range of Difficulty\n1 .96 .91 to .99 .96 .92 to .99 -2.0 -6.0 to 4.0\n2 .95 .90 to .99 .96 .92 to .99 -1.5 -5.9 to 4.1\n3 .94 .89 to .99 .94 .90 to .99 -0.5 -5.5 to 3.8\n4 .94 .92 to .98 .94 .90 to .97 1.3 -4.9 to 5.3\n5 .93 .81 to .98 .93 .79 to .96 0.3 -5.1 to 5.3\n6 .94 .89 to .97 .95 .85 to .97 -0.7 -5.6 to 6.0\n7 .94 .87 to .97 .95 .88 to .97 -1.2 -5.7 to 5.8\n8 .95 .88 to .98 .95 .91 to .97 -0.7 -5.5 to 5.2\n\nPlease let us know what questions you have so we can assist.
