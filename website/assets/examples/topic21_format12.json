        "text":"Like us on Facebook!\n\nWhat is Calisthenics?\n\nCalisthenics is primarily a team artistic dance sport performed on a stage comprising of routines performed to music and in costume. Calisthenics can be described as a \u2018one stop performance shop\u2019 as the routines are made up of gymnastic & ballet movements, they require acting, singing and apparatus manipulation.\n\n\nIn any year, a team will perform the following core items:\n\n\n  \u2022 Figure March (March in formation)\n\n  \u2022 Free Exercises (similar to gymnastics)\n\n  \u2022 Rods (Manipulation of a light weight\u00a0metal rod)\n\n  \u2022 Clubs (swinging of wooden clubs)\n\nAs well as 2-3 of the following 'fancy' items:\u200b\n\n  \u2022 Aesthetic (graceful form of dance)\n\n  \u2022 Rhythmic (similar to ballet)\n\n  \u2022 Folk Dance (A traditional dance from another country)\n\n  \u2022 Calisthenic Spectacular (combination of free exercises and dance)\n\n  \u2022 Song & Dance (singing with dance)\n\n  \u2022 Song & Action (singing with acting)\n\n  \u2022 Calisthenic Revue (everything in one!)\n\nAt the most elite level, calisthenics requires competitors to have high levels of flexibility, strength, balance and control. Precision, standard technique and good deportment are also required. Girls wear beautiful costumes often designed and sewn especially for the year's competition items.\n\nWhat is Calisthenics?\n\nWhy should I choose Calisthenics for my child?\n\nYour child will develop positive qualities such as the ability to work in a team, self-discipline and social skills whilst having fun, making friends and keeping fit. That's not all...\n\n\nUnlike other dance sports, calisthenics does not require parents to spend a fortune on\u00a0endless amounts of costumes that are often worn only once or twice. We have a large store of beautiful costumes, this means you only pay a small costume hire fee once per year.\u00a0\n\n\nAt NSW Calisthenics we appreciate all of our families and are grateful for the contributions not only made by our pupils but by our mums, dads, grandparents, brothers and sisters as well.\n\nQualified Coaches\n\nClasses are presented by experienced coaches who are Level 1 accredited and First Aid trained. Classes are held by a number of Sydney based clubs ranging from recreational to competitive classes. Some Clubs travel interstate for competitions to Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory.",

        "text":"Our Team\n\nMetaboost Review About Us\n\nWayne Clements\n\nWayne Clements \u2013 When you think of your typical \u201cbro\u201d, Wayne Clements fits the bill \u2013 visually. He\u2019s got the muscles to back up his mouth, but deep down he\u2019s a softy. If you\u2019re having trouble with creating a workout routine, Clements would be more than happy to help. He really is a stand-up guy.\n\n\nJohn CleganeJohn CleganeNicknamed, \u201cThe Peninsula\u201d, John Clegane is the guy to go to if you have any male enhancement related questions. He\u2019s not afraid to admit that he uses male enhancement pills, because he knows how outright effective they are. If a man like Clegane can use them without shame, then so can you.\n\nColt PowersColt Powers \u2013 When Colt Powers isn\u2019t dreaming of starring in 80s action movies (Come on, how can you not with that name?), he\u2019s working on his efficiency in the gym. He\u2019s a great guy to workout with, since he knows his stuff, as long as you\u2019re okay with one-liners that don\u2019t even relate to the situation. \u201cHey man\u2026. You need to chill out.\u201d Oh, Colt \u2013 never change.\n\n\nBruce RandolphBruce Randolph \u2013 Bruce is the kind of guy who is gonna let you know if your form is wrong. Now, that might seem kind of pretentious, but he\u2019s really just lookin\u2019 out for you.\u00a0 He\u2019s constantly trying to improve his technique, and he\u2019ll stop at nothing until he\u2019s perfected his workouts.\n\n\nRon SwinsonRon Swinson \u2013 Ron Swinson is the man of mans. He\u2019s the man that every man wants to be. Fully bearded and jacked to the extreme, Swinson could probably rip a tree trunk out of the ground if he really tried. If there was a battle between Swinson and a sabretooth tiger, we\u2019d probably bet on Swinson. He\u2019s the kind of guy that respects nature for what it is, so he only uses all-natural workout supplements.\n\nNick KoneliNick Koneli \u2013 Koneli understands the importance of cardio, and he doesn\u2019t keep quiet about it. When he\u2019s not sprinting, he\u2019s running. When he\u2019s not running, he\u2019s jogging. When he\u2019s not jogging, he\u2019s walking at a brisk pace. It\u2019s incredibly hard to keep up with Mr. Koneli, but he swears by his routine, and once you can get on Koneli\u2019s level, well, that\u2019s how you know you\u2019ve made it to the top.",
