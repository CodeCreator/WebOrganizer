        "text":"Cutting through wire and air: a visit to AudioQuest HQ\n\nWhen asked to mentally\u00a0picture\u00a0what goes on inside AudioQuest\u2019s headquarters in Irvine, California, what do you see? Huge spools of cable turning slowly for the deft handiwork of desk-bound terminators?\u00a0Or perhaps a brightly-lit, lab-coated environment where strips of cable are waved through flame and\u00a0dipped in chemicals? I\u2019ve met with\u00a0AudioQuest employees all over\u00a0the world \u2013 Boulder, Jersey City, New York City, Sydney, Munich \u2013\u00a0but until four weeks ago had yet to visit\u00a0the mothership\u00a0in Irvine, California.\n\nWith the T.H.E Newport Show relocated to the Hotel Irvine for 2015 and AudioQuest\u2019s headquarters located just across the road, a perfect\u00a0opportunity presented to\u00a0poke my head around the door.\u00a0What exactly lay behind\u00a0those beige concrete walls? Playing the long-distance-traveller card but with extra purpose, I invited myself. Could I also pick up\u00a0a pair of the soon-to-released\u00a0NightHawk headphones that sounded so fine\u00a0at their\u00a0CES 2015 debut?\u00a0\u201cYes\u201d and \u201cSure thing\u201d\u00a0was the spirit\u00a0of AudioQuest\u2019s VP of Communications Stephen Mejias\u2019 replies. That was April.\n\nBy the time I hit the ground\u00a0in Irvine six weeks later the tour-for-one had been expanded to include other\u00a0interested parties: Herb Reichert of\u00a0Stereophile, Paul McGowan and Scott McGowan of PS Audio, their PR guy Bill Leebens, Jack Wu and Michael Liang of Woo Audio. More attendees\u00a0meant sushi and beer in the listening room before the tour proper. I can heartily recommend Ballast Point\u2019s Indra Kunindra, an \u2018India-style Export Stout\u2019 brewed just down the way in San Diego. The label\u2019s eight-legged\u00a0sea creature points to the taste complexity held\u00a0the bottle. A pitch black pour\u00a0delivers big to\u00a0the palette: green curry and coconut flavours go bullish before hints of liquorice round out the after-taste.\n\nRemember this beer \u2013 we\u2019ll be coming back to it.\n\nFounder Bill Low and SVP [of] Marketing and Product Development Joe Harley led the AudioQuest HQ tour proper. Just along the hallway from the listening room we are shown a space\u00a0hosting cable termination stations.\u00a0Nothing unexpected about that.\n\n\nIn the room\u2019s\u00a0corner, spools of cable.\n\n\nAcross the hall a\u00a0door leads us\u00a0into a\u00a0warehouse that fulfils orders that come from all over the map; not the entire world though. Similar facilities in The Netherlands and Hong Kong supply AudioQuest product\u00a0to Europe and Asia respectively.\n\nMirrored supply solutions notwithstanding, AudioQuest\u2019s warehouse space\u00a0in Irvine is arrestingly large. How large? 32000 square feet. Australians \u2013 think\u00a0Bunnings Warehouse, Americans \u2013 think Staples or OfficeMax, Brits \u2013 Homebase. This primary warehouse\u00a0space\u00a0houses\u00a0around 2400 pallets of gear whilst the adjacent, smaller 17000-square-foot\u00a0warehouse (that we didn\u2019t see) reportedly houses half as much again. Stored across the two spaces is around\u00a06-8\u00a0months\u2019 worth of stock.\n\nBoth\u00a0warehouses pre-date AudioQuest\u2019s arrival but\u00a0all of their\u00a0inner workings (shelving, conveyors, etc.) were built and\/or selected specifically to meet the company\u2019s\u00a0needs and standards.\u00a0A quick glance at the shelves shows just how exacting\u00a0organisational standards are\u00a0at AudioQuest. Under the watchful eye of Bryan Long (VP of Operations), AudioQuest\u00a0ship anything\u00a0between five to fifteen\u00a0pallets per day and almost any order received by noon will ship that same day.\n\nStereophile\u2019s Herb Reichert is confounded by the enormity of an\u00a0AudioQuest warehouse.\n\nShipments\u00a0head out to destinations all over the world\u00a0to big-box stores, independent hi-fi dealers and online retailers. Mejias tells us that Long\u00a0is also affectionately referred to as the\u00a0VP of Getting Shit Done. No doubt a mandatory requirement for anyone overseeing\u00a0a warehousing operation of this magnitude.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Mejias would later point out that it\u2019s far from a one-man show: \u201cWe also have a warehouse manager named Chris Flanigan, a facilities manager named Jason Althouse, and a QC manager named Ken Lauzon. All awesome dudes, who\u2019ve been with the company for years and who put a great amount of pride and joy into their work, keeping the place clean, organised, and running efficiently.\u201d\n\nEven more\u00a0memorable than the size of the space is its cooling system. Off to one side, a Joape Misting Fan from down under. Firing air down from the above\u00a0is a Big Ass (ceiling) Fan. Yes, that\u2019s the brand name \u2013\u00a0no clarification\u00a0required.\n\n\nIn 2015, AudioQuest is no longer just\u00a0a cable company \u2013 they\u2019re a tech company. Like the many-tendrilled Octopus of the Ballast Point beer artwork, AudioQuest\u2019s product line points in many directions but especially\u00a0towards computer audio. Code from Wavelength Audio\u2019s Gordon Rankin does\u00a0the heavy-lifting on the DragonFly DAC, whose second, superior-sounding\u00a0revision came\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0price drop.\n\nAlmost a year on from its publication, consistently strong reader click-throughs to my own\u00a0DragonFly v1.2 review\u00a0underscore thirst for good, simple and affordable computer audio products \u2013\u00a0something that AudioQuest seemingly have been aware of for some time.\n\nRankin\u2019s code smarts were contracted again for\u00a0the USB\/Bluetooth\u00a0Beetle DAC that launched in Munich (US$149\u00a0US$159, covered here) and again, in collaboration with Garth Powell, for the JitterBug USB filter (US$49, covered here and here).\u00a0Front-footing the\u00a0message of high digital audio utility at\u00a0sensible pricing is Boulder-based VP of Development\u00a0Steve Silberman. His Computer Audio Demystified seminars at audio shows are consistently\u00a0filled\u00a0to capacity. AudioQuest is now a brand name that\u00a0buzzes in\u00a0the minds of a different, broader and younger demographic.\u00a0Hats off.\n\nPowell was\u00a0also fundamental\u00a0to the development of the\u00a0Niagara 7000 Low-Z Power Noise-Dissipation System ($7995) that could be seen\/heard back across the road at The Hotel Irvine\u2019s Optimal Enchantment room. Don\u2019t be put off by the product\u00a0name. It\u2019s par for the course in the context of AudioQuest\u2019s forward lean with\u00a0grandiose-sounding job titles.\n\n\nAt the business end of this system were Vandersteen Model 7 Mk.II loudspeakers driven by matching M7-HPA amplifiers. On source amplification duties a\u00a0Reference 10 preamp and Reference Phono 10 phono pre-amplifier from Audio Research. I punched in something from AC\/DC. The resulting sound should have taken heads clean off when played at Sunday afternoon\u2019s louder volumes\u2026but it didn\u2019t, all the while staying just the right side of vibrant and energetic, a\u00a0result\u00a0consistent with\u00a0the glare-reducing and instrument separating talents of the\u00a0JitterBug that I hear back in Sydney.\n\nFollowing his schooling in AudioQuest Ethernet cables,\u00a0I lent a\u00a0JitterBug out to skeptical\u00a0audiophile pal, Barry. My only instructions were,\u00a0\u201cPut this between your computer and your DAC and tell me what differences you hear (if any).\u201d\n\nBarry\u2019s\u00a0thoughts came down the web\u00a0wire\u00a0two days later: \u201cFirst impressions of the JitterBug. I\u2019ve plugged it in to a Macbook Pro that feeds a Chord Hugo outputting to OPPO PM-3 headphones. The little blighter definitely opens up the top end, lending more definition to the highest notes. There\u2019s perhaps a little more control all around and timing seems a little better. On Belle & Sebastian\u2019s \u201cEnter Sylvia Plath\u201d guitars chime with greater clarity. Energy on bass synth delivery is a bit better too. Vocal separation is enhanced. The little\u00a0thing\u00a0upgrades sound quality more than\u00a0any USB cable I\u2019ve tried.\u201d\u00a0\n\nL-R: Jack Wu, Michael Liang, Skylar Gray, Herb Reichert\n\nAudioQuest\u2019s product diversification\u00a0continues with the NightHawk headphone. Ex-Westone Labs engineer Skylar Gray was appointed as\u00a0AudioQuest\u2019s Director of Ear-Speaker Products in December\u00a02012.\u00a0Gray lives a fifteen\u00a0minute walk from\u00a0AudioQuest\u2019s Irvine facility where\u00a0his office\/development lab is located\u00a0upstairs, above the warehouse. The space is divided\u00a0into two. Up front in a space that measure no more than 2m x 3m, all the modern office conveniences \u2013 a desk, a chair a phone and a computer \u2013 nothing too exciting about that.\n\nIn the similarly sized section up the back we\u00a0see numerous prototypes of the\u00a0NightHawk hung on the left wall. CES 2015 attendees saw\u00a0a selection of these at The Venetian. To\u00a0the right we\u00a0are introduced to KEMAR, a head and torso simulator (HATS) made by Danish firm G.R.A.S. Acoustics,\u00a0used to study the performance of loudspeakers\/headphones\/hearing aids\/etc. or even to binaurally record music & sound.\n\n\nKEMAR has been designed to simulate the physical effects of the head, torso, pinnae (outer ear), and middle ear on an incoming acoustic sound source. It (he!)\u00a0comprises a stereo microphone with anatomical features that are statistically averaged from a large sample\u00a0of human body measurements across a) both western and eastern cultures and b) both genders. G.R.A.S. Acoustics are apparently the only HATS manufacturer to do so.\n\n\u201cThere are limitations to KEMAR\u2019s accuracy or any HATS for that matter. I had the option to purchase any HATS I wanted\u2026from B&K, Head Acoustics, G.R.A.S., etc. These things are not cheap, often tens of thousands of dollars. I have been fortunate to have had direct experience with all of them but\u00a0for AudioQuest I chose\u00a0what I consider to be the best on the market right now,\u201d explains Gray.\n\n\nChristened Data, after the Star Trek: Next Generation character, Gray uses his KEMAR to\u00a0harvest headphone measurements. \u201cIf you know where to get a screen-accurate wig and uniform, let me know,\u201d says Gray. Sorry, I don\u2019t.\n\nOn the software side, Gray\u00a0uses\u00a0Listen, Inc\u2019s SoundCheck\u00a0to generate \u2018stimulus sounds\u2019: tone sweeps, noise and even music are fed\u00a0via an RME laboratory-grade DAC \/\u00a0headphone amplifier\u00a0into headphones strapped onto KEMAR\u2019s cranium. KEMAR captures the signal and\u00a0his output fed back into the A\/D converters of the RME device. The software then analyses the incoming signal and can generate all manner of measurements from frequency response to various types of distortion to impedance to cumulative spectral decay, waterfalls and more...

        "text":"Warning! Avoid Eyelead Gel-Sticks for Sony A7 Cameras \u2013 Part 1\n\nThis is the best thing I can do for the photography community is give some advice about my personal experience using Photographylife.com\u2019s Eyelead Gel-Stick for Sony Sensors. Right now, I CANNOT and WILL NOT recommend them for ANY Sony sensor cleaning on any mirrorless camera in the Alpha series!\n\nThe staff over at PhotographyLife.com have visited various forums over the last several months warning photographers not to buy Chinese counterfeit knock-offs of it\u2019s sensor gel-sticks from Eyelead in Germany designed to remove dust specks and other debris off of camera sensors because the counterfeits have damaged several Sony cameras. I took their advice and purchased a gel-stick about 8 months ago directly from PhotographyLife.com. Recently after getting back from a 12-day photography trip from New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada, I noticed a few dust specks on my much-loved Sony A7R camera.\n\nThis was my chance to try the much anticipated Eyelead Gel-Stick from Photography life. To my complete horror, the stick was uneasy to pull away from the sensor upon first trying it out without lifting the cover glass on the Sony A7R or damaging the glass. This turned into a nightmare minutes later and instead of yanking it off, or pulling on it, or forcing it, I gently was able to lift it off from working it on one side of the gel head and then gently removing. After checking to see if it removed the dust speak, to my dismay I noticed a bunch of residue from the stick itself adhering to the Sony Sensor which looked far worse than the dust speck! I was immediately angered.\n\nI tried a few more times to apply the gel-stick after utilizing the sticky paper supplied with the product to see if that would help in removing the residue. I was very gentle utilizing the gel-stick and used the same method of lifting the gel stick from one side to remove it from the sensor. It was obvious! The more I tried to fix the situation, the more damage and residue it left on the sensor! Madness would be doing to same thing over and over expecting different results so I stopped cold turkey and will never buy another flipping gel-stick, unfortunately. I hate \u2019em now, every last gel-stick! Grrr\u2026\n\nMy Verdict is \u2013 This product from Eyelead and PhotographyLife.com is totally questionable and I find it flabbergasting that I paid so much from the \u201cauthorized source\u201d and it\u2019s a fact, in my book, that it DOES NOT WORK and it will damage or cause further damage to any Sony Full Frame Sensor.\n\nIn the photos above you will notice some discoloration to the sensor where the gel-stick was applied. It\u2019s my hypothesis that this is actually the Sony Sensor coating either being directly affected or even removed as a result of using the Eyelead Gel-Stick. It was maddening \u201ctrying to fix\u201d the situation caused by the Eyelead Sony Gel-Stick. Nasim, from Photographylife.com, reached out to me and have informed me that they are sending a wet-cleaning solution that will help me out here. I hope a wet clean will remove the discoloration and residue caused by the Eyelead!? If it doesn\u2019t, this will require\u00a0a much more expensive repair as a result of trusting Eyelead\u2019s Gel-Sticks!\n\nI\u2019ve been doing wet-cleaning methods on digital camera sensors for years with absolutely no problems with companies like Visible Dust back in the olden days. Cleaning camera sensors comes natural to me. I\u2019m hoping a wet clean clears up any visual blemishes\u00a0on the sensor caused by the Eyelead. If it does not, I will know for a fact that Eyelead Gel-Sticks damage Sony mirrorless cameras and will follow up with \u2013 Part 2!\n\n*Note, In an effort to be fair and balanced \u2013 here\u2019s an email message sent to me within minutes after posting this article from Nasim Mansurov @ PhotographyLife.com:\n\nNate, I\u2019m not sure why you ordered Eclipse when an order of a wet cleaning kit with swabs was heading your way. USPS doesn\u2019t work on weekends, so it was going out tomorrow. We have a better cleaning solution than Eclipse, which might not be able to easily remove the residue you see on the sensor. PS had to decrease the quality of their chemical liquid after dealing with a lot of complaints from Sony users whose coatings on AA filters were getting removed by the solution.\n\nI understand your frustration with our product, however, please note that we have tens of thousands of happy customers who use the sensor gel stick to clean their Sony cameras. I don\u2019t know whether the sample product you received was faulty, or some strange chemical or coatings on your A7R caused incompatibility, but it is a very rare case. Do you think we would still be selling the product if every customer had a problem? I personally issue full refunds for every customer who has a problem with our products \u2013 imagine if I had to do that for every order out there, we would be losing money left and right. These cases are extremely rare and whenever there is a complaint about any residue problem, I try to get the customer to send me their camera so that I can investigate the case and report to Eyelead Germany. However, in this case you didn\u2019t want to send the camera for cleaning, so it is not in my hands to see the issue, which is why the best I can offer is to send you a wet cleaning kit.\n\nThe Desert is an Unknown Place\n\nThat is the truth that I believe in; one where the status quo has no control over your personal sovereignty and you begin to go back to the roots of our non-reality. The desert is one such place of mystery, full of the Unknown. I\u2019ve learned this over the last decade and a half while roaming canyon labyrinths and mountain ranges. What I have witnessed adds a lot of meaning to this short life of mine. We rural desert dwellers see and hear a lot more than those who get entrapped and surrounded by dense civilization. Out there on the outskirts of the fringe you begin to see what\u2019s truly shrouded while being accompanied by\u00a0structures and ruins from the distant past that slowly wrought and crumble to the harsh desert elements.\n\nVoigtl\u00e4nder Heliar 15mm F4.5 Superwide for Sony E Mount \u2013 Test Drive\n\nVoigtlander Heliar 15mm Test Drive\n\nThe other day I had the opportunity to take the new\u00a0Voigtlander Super Wide-Heliar 15mm f\/4.5 Aspherical III Lens for Sony E for a test drive using the Sony A7R. The results were pretty otherworldly for amazing landscapes.\u00a0The sharpness of the lens, all the way into the extreme corners, passed my professional scrutiny. What is really pleasing is the fact that the Sony E-Mount version of the Voigtl\u00e4nder communicates all necessary EXIF data to the camera. It also automatically engages manual focus assist when you turn the manual focus dial on the lens.\n\nI had to trade out several legacy lenses in order to raise enough money to cover the cost of this lens. Here\u2019s a few more test examples from the same shoot, below.\n\nOther thoughts regarding the Voigtlander\u2026\n\nAll-in-all this lens really nails everything I need in a ultra wide for landscapes. When I finally switched to Sony Full Frame a few months ago from Micro Four Thirds \u2013 I was completely surprised by the unexpected learning curve that came with moving back into full-frame. The truth\u00a0is, legacy glass works well on cropped sensors because the small sensor cuts\u00a0out the imperfect corners of most legacy lenses while only utilizing the best part of the lens in the center. Switching up to a 36 megapixel sensor on a\u00a0Sony Alpha A7R amplifies the smallest flaws of old 35mm lenses. So the HUNT for decent wide angle\u00a0turned into\u00a0quite a chore.\n\nBad Experiences with Samyang vs Voigtlander!?\n\nThere are a few legacy lenses that work nicely with the Sony but when shooting with Micro Four Thirds, I was used to shooting super-wide for landscape work. So my initial choice was the\u00a0Rokinon 14mm F2.8 Ultra Wide Lens. The first copy of this 14mm lens turned out to be\u00a0a de-centered piece of trash aka a $300 dollar paper weight. The whole right side of the frame was terribly blurry. I ended up trying three times to get a decent copy of the lens and finally gave up. When I tried to reach out to Samyang\u00a0\/Rokinon about this negative experience, they ignored me and deleted my comments on their Facebook fan page. That inspired me to do some research which led\u00a0me to Voigtlander\u2019s offerings. I was able to secure\u00a0a near-perfect copy of the Heliar 15mm III on the first round despite the fact that Cosina\/Voigtlander has had some manufacturing issues with the 15mm, as well, \u00a0resulting in this thread on Fred Miranda. However the latest copies of Heliar III \u00a0(as of Sept. 2016) seem to be totally fixed and I got my copy from one of their latest production batches.Yes, I also heard about the new Rokinon 14mm F2.8 Auto Focus Lens for Sony E-Mount. It\u00a0was announced while I was investigating the Voigtlander.\n\nLong Hunt for a Superwide Finally Settled! \ud83d\ude42\n\nWith Cosina\u2019s ability to listen to customers, fix any quality control issues they may have, as well as having a long history in the camera business; I am decidedly in favor of Cosina\/Voigtlander and their high quality products. I\u2019m happy with this iteration of the classic Heliar 15mm Super Wide lens. It reminds me of the days when shooting with\u00a0Voigtlander\u2019s 35mm Best-L camera with a 15mm Heliar attached. I miss those old film days and I\u2019m glad to be shooting landscapes with a Sony Full Frame.",

It's always interesting to me to know when there has been propagation over a particular path, even if I wasn't around to take advantage of it and make any contacts.\n\nA month ago I discovered that the 2m beacon GB3VHF transmits using JT65B mode, and after leaving my receiver on all day found that it had been copied on several occasions. I wondered whether there were any other beacons that use this mode.\n\nWell, I have found one more. IT9X is an experimental 6m beacon that operates using CW, JT65B and BPSK31 on 50.057MHz. It is located in JM78re grid square. It is operational 24\/7 running 10 watts to a loop antenna. Its carrier is locked to a GPS receiver to give a high degree of accuracy.

I decided to stick with 40m and of course, like all digimode contacts this year, I was QRP 5W or less with the Yaesu FT-817ND connected to the all band alu tape vertical.\n\nFirst thing I encountered was that N1MM+ would not update? Strange it did go well last week! Reading the latest news on the N1MM+ logger website revealed the software was not beta anymore and there was a new version on line. So I took the risk and downloaded - installed version 0.19 without removing the beta version first. Everything luckely went well. Next problem was the cat control with the FT-817, the connection was lost every couple of minutes. So digging in to that I found you better follow the recommendation setup of 4800bd (menu item 14 CAT RATE). Problem solved then, never had this issue in the classic version though.\n\nI did give the tip in my previous post using \"Auto TRX offset\" when using AFSK but this didn't work at all. I've been thinking it over all weekend and Sunday evening I found the problem. You really should use AFSK RTTY on LSB. Turn menu item 26 into PSK31-L and don't forget to do the same in MMVARI. In MMTTY it's just a matter of reverse button off. Can't remember if had similair issues with the classic version. Unfortenately contest was almost over now but the spots were finally right on frequency. It improved my rate a little\n\nTwo other problems or \"bugs\". I saw others had it as well. Not every DX cluster could be contacted. PI4CC for instance could not be contacted. PI5EHV though was not a problem. I don't know why? But at least I had one connection. Another bug I bumped into was in MMTTY, most of the time TX was hanging. Very annoying to press \"esc\" every time after a transmission. So I used MMVARI most of the time as it didn't have that problem at all. Not shure if setup was wrong?\n\nI tested ESM mode both with \"enter\" and with \"left click\" on the digital screen. If you got a reliable QRO station and good antennas this will work very well. In QRP S&P mode though it's most of the time worthless. Too many times you have to repeat your call or report and that means not only press enter or your left mouse button but clicking the right buttons.\n\nHow did my contest go? Well, actually not too bad. I made 80 QSOs with 40 DXCC. Best DX was with ZX2B from Brazil (8960km). I did work one station from the USA and one from Canada. Did hear Colombia and Japan with strong signals but they didn't hear me unfortenately. Actually for a QRP station with limited time I did not bad I think.\n\n\n  1. Hoi Bas, hier ook een aantal problemen gehad met de nieuwe versie en ik gebruik hem nu al een aantal weken. Ik dacht dat mijn pc niet snel genoeg was. Met cq geven duurde het soms 1 of 2 seconden voordat de zender overging naar TX. Zeer vervelend is dat, ook een probleem dat mijn control van de pc naar mijn zender uitviel. Net als bij jou dus. Hier alleen op de 20m meegedaan en een 785 qso's gemaakt. Mooiste dx was voor mij FK8DD die me aanriep. Maar aanbod was slecht vond ik op 20m. Mis dan toch de hogere banden. Had iets van een 311.000 punten. Heb 23:55 meegedaan..\n\n\n    1. Hallo Peter, nou lijkt mij wel een redelijke score. Hoorde dat cdx niet zo best was dit jaar. N1MM+ is misschien geen beta meer maar de kinderziektes zijn er nog niet uit. Vind voor de rest het prog er wel mooi uitzien. Hier en daar een stuk duidelijker. Wat betreft dat uitvallen van de CAT control is bij jou misschien ook een kwestie van baudrate naar beneden zetten. 73, Bas\n\n  2. Good evening Bas, very nice report on how the contest went and I had a smile on my face as I read. I have run into the very same situations during my contest adventures. One rule I had was to never update software just before or during a contest\u2026.BUT\u2026. you were having trouble and the new release was not beta. I agree that ESM is not the way to go unless things are very reliable and your not QRP. I avoided using it in the past as things can get very confusing fast. For the time your were on you did a fine job with contacts! Congrats\n\n    1. Hello Mike, indeed normally I would never update during a contest. However I had problems and N1MM+ asks if I like to update which I did before without any problems. Problems are still there but there is a update every day so I guess it will be solved within no time. 73, Bas\n\n\nThanks for your comment. Bedankt voor je reactie. 73, Bas",

By installing QR code readers on consumer phones, if was suddenly possible for everyone to create and read QR codes and to connect easily to mobile sites. Today QR Codes are so pervasive in Japan that it's almost impossible not to see one. You can find them in advertisements, mobile campaigns, on maps, in magazines, on billboards etc. In that sense the QR Code revolution is comparable to SMS. It's an easy and simple tool, the cost of the connection to a mobile site is below the price of an SMS and it's up to you to decide whether or not you want to scan it.\n\nThe QR code is about to become widely used in the United States as well. Google Maps already uses them and offers posters for clients to use. Facebook is starting a location service that relies on QR code. We recommend that all our clients start using QR code on their web sites, front door and in advertising as we are on our contact page.\nThis is a video demonstration of QR code being used in Elle\u00a9 magazine advertisement.\nWe have developed a program which will generate the code for you. It is web based and very easy to use. Just enter your contact information and QR code will be downloaded to your browser.\n\nClick here to get your QR code.\nQR Code:\nClick this QR code\nto get Kawa Reader\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

Even though the demands during the launch was less crazier compared to Apple iPhone5, supply was pretty low and resulted in many failing to get one. The phone is available in white and titantium color casing, and I chose the white color version. My first impression of the Note II upon powering it on was that the usage was smooth and snappy. This is likely due to the quad-core CPU that is running this device. Installing apps was a breeze, and even loading GPS application such as Sygics was fast. The super AMOLED screen was indeed crisp and sharp, and made viewing of pictures and videos a fantastic experience.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note II (LTE)\n\nRead the rest of this page \u00bb",
