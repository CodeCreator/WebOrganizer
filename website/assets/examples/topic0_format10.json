        "text":"Salma Hayek has been caught up in a celebrity sex tape video scandal with billionaire husband Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault after being just married on Valentines Day in Paris 2009 and then making the first ever\u00a0Salma Hayek sex tape video for our viewing pleasure.\n\nThe video according to recent scandal reports features Salma and Francois making love on a giant couch with alcohol and candles everywhere. In the video Francois does not seem to be much of a catch as he looks to be out for his jolly only, however Salma is a giver the entire time doing anything he ask her to do. The video run time is about 15 minutes from start to finish and Salma still denies the video is of her and now ex-husband, however the resemblance is just to close to tell, especially with both of them in the same video at the same time says reports.\n\nSalma is one of our favorite celebs after being featured in movies like Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn and Fools Rush In just to name a few. So if you are a Salma fan like we are and well\u2026 most men in America this is a must see sex tape for sure!\n\nCalls to both Salma and Francois reps have gone UN-returned thus far.\n\n[UPDATE] \u2013 We were contacted by an anonymous source that claimed and showed us some video of a very young looking Hayek\u2026 we are talking like teens. He is saying that he used to be neighbors with Salma and would like to remain anonymous on the entire deal. You can check it out for yourself we are not going to say if it is her either way as we can not tell, but the girl does look like a very young Salma for sure.",

The organisers also auctioned off the virginity of a 23-year-old Russian man, which apparently went to a Brazilian woman for a measly $3,000.\n\nIn Brazil the auction has not surprisingly attracted controversy for both general moral turpitude and constituting prostitution, although the organisers somehow maintain it does not constitute prostitution.\n\n\nIn Japan as well the auction has attracted controversy \u2013 although perhaps for different reasons:\n\n\n\u201cYou could go to a soapland a thousand times for that much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an expensive whore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen really live life in easy mode.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a bit much for such an ugly girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cVirgin fanciers are seriously creepy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this even legal?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how much of a virgin hunter you are that is too much for a girl like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could buy up 100 virgin JCs for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the buyer here really Japanese?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the shame of Japan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat virgin boy is so cheap\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHim going for $3,000 is the real news here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is sexual discrimination or something!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pure 33-year-old virgin \u2013 please buy me!\u201d\n\n\nRecent News\n\nRecent Galleries\n\nRecent Comments",

The Fetish Pride runs from May 25 to May 29. This sixth edition includes events at The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, Club Church, Dirty Dicks, the Eagle Amsterdam, and The Web. Fetish stores Black Body, Mister B, RoB, and hairdresser Cuts & Curls will also do their bit in making this yet another successful Fetish Pride.\n\nDrik Gear, Mister Rubber 2016\n\nAlthough it is the most visible form, a fetish does not necessarily involve certain clothes or materials, but can also be about sexual practices. To cater for this, Fetish Pride has a delightful perverse start on May 25 in the Dirty Dicks, Warmoesstraat 86, with the monthly \u201cGolden Shower Party,\u201d starting at 20:00. To let the water flow excessively, beer and soft drinks only are three euros for this occasion. Those with different desires can visit Club Church, Kerkstraat 52, from 22:00 onwards, where the extravagant Hopelezz family rules the \u201cBlue Fetish.\u201d With exceptional performances, visitors can expect wild and eccentric misfits.\n\nOn Friday, May 26, the party starts at 20:00 with the \u201cBeer Bust\u201d in The Web, Sint Jacobsstraat 6. Here, DJ Bramsterdam and DJ Big General are spinning. Around the corner in The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, Nieuwezijdse Kolk 6, the first of three \u201cFetish Nest\u201d nights are organised. Everyone can indulge in his wildest fetish fantasy in the huge basement after a drink at the bar.\n\nHere, the basement is the legendary cruise space that, especially for Fetish Pride, is equipped with a sling and other equipment. DJ Mally Clark is spinning there. Those who like a change can visit \u201c(Z)onderbroek\u201d at Club Church from 22:00, where leather, rubber or sportswear is taken off for dancing and cruising in or without (!) underwear. Here you can expect, as the organisation says, \u201clots of guys with boners in their briefs.\u201d\n\nMister Rubber Contest\nDuring Fetish Pride the Mr Rubber Netherlands Foundation will organise the annual election of its Dutch rubber scene representative. At a rubber-only night on Friday (21:00) in the Eagle Amsterdam, Warmoesstraat 90, the current Mr Rubber, Dirk Gear, will give his stepping down speech. Afterwards, the rubber men in the audience and the jury will elect the first round candidates for the title Mr Rubber Netherlands 2017.\n\nThis is done in an entertaining and lively show the visitors appreciate and have come to know so well. It will be a social event among rubber men, although the basement will also see some action! This year, the jury will consist, among others, of Javi, the current Mr Rubber Spain, and Preston So, Mr International Rubber 2017, flown in especially from New York City.\n\nThe final will take place on Saturday night (22:00-23:00) during \u201cInvasion,\u201d Amsterdam Fetish Pride\u2019s main party. The Mr Rubber election is known for its extravagant extra\u2019s, such as vacuum cubes, driving cages, pony play carts, etc. However, chances are that the organisation will surpass last year\u2019s edition in kinky eccentricity, so don\u2019t miss out! The candidates will then be presented once more, and Mister Rubber Netherlands 2017 will be announced.\n\n\nThis rubber spectacle, however, will only be the kick-off of \u201cInvasion,\u201d as it is this Pride\u2019s main party where all fetish-lovers can get their money\u2019s worth. \u201cInvasion\u201d takes place in Undercurrent, Papaverweg 265, at the NDSM-terrein.\n\nThis location can accommodate over a thousand visitors and is just ten minutes from Amsterdam Central Station. Take the ferry from the station to the Buiksloterweg, followed by a free shuttle that gets you there within minutes.\n\nDJ RW from the Netherlands and DJ T&T (Topher & Trippy) from France will be spinning, offering great mixes. Go-go dancers and live shows by international porn stars Brock Hatcher and Michael Duncan will provide the necessary pit-stop entertainment. Also, there is a large dark room with all your heart\u2019s desire, from slings and beds to benches. \u201cInvasion\u201d truly offers the opportunity to go wild. The party lasts until the wee small hours, and the admission fee is 25.00 euros presale and 30.00 euros at the door. See\n\nBut there is more. The Web will host a fetish flea market on Saturday from 13:00, and the Amsterdam Kink Academy traditionally will organise a number of workshops, while the participating businesses offer events not mentioned above.
