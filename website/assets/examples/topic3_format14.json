April of 2007 I was a victim of domestic violence and as a result of being wrongfully arrested, I do not have my children and didn't even get to see them for 3 months at that time (5yrs old and 9 yrs old). Even when I made it to the ER the next day, the Sheriffs department told the ER Dr. that I attacked my husband when in fact he attacked me. I will never ever get over this and ended up moving out of the county as the domestic support group suggested in order to get a restraining order on the ex-husband. I just have to try and not think about this but some days are so hard especially when my children don't even want to go back to their Dad's. I get to see them fail at academics, not attend school, go through mental abuse beyond anyone's imagination, and get hit by their dad and still sleep with the youngest boy who is 10. I still have 3 crushed discs in my neck which has changed my life forever physically and memories of that horrible night that will haunt me for the rest of my life. To this day my children have missed over 23 days of school as usual, have been beaten by my ex-husband several times since 2007, he still sleeps with my youngest boy who is 10. Reports have been filed but nothing has been done, or will ever be done by that county. My children are not important enough. It is a different law they go by up there in Lake County and as a result my children are the ones who suffer. The nickname for Lake County is \"The good ole boys club\". It was extremely difficult to even get representation for my divorce because the out of town lawyers knew it would be a tough case because of the \"Good Ole Boys Club\".\n\nA mother currently residing in Missoula County while my children still reside in Lake County with no help from the law.\n\n1 like, 0 dislikes\nPosted by sadformykids on 02\/22\/2012 at 6:35 PM\n\nFavorite Places\n\n  \u2022 None.\nFind places \u00bb\n\nSaved Events\n\n  \u2022 Nada.\nFind events \u00bb\n\nSaved Stories\n\n  \u2022 Nope.\nFind stories \u00bb\n\nCustom Lists\n\n  \u2022 Zip.\n\n\u00a9 2017 Missoula News\/Independent Publishing | Powered by Foundation",
