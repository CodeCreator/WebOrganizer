While the code examples still work for that API version, the policies, guidelines, and some links may have changed. Please refer to the latest version of the documentation for those.\n\nThis page provides the official SpongePowered logo and mascot. Feel free to use them to spread the word about Sponge. However note that these images are not provided under the MIT License.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re reading a translated version, please note that the English license is the one which counts. Translated licenses are only provided for informational purposes.\n\nYou may:\n\n  \u2022 Make minor modifications to Spongie\u2019s facial expressions - such as making a cute smile, making them perplexed or sad, adding a hat, and so on. It should be easily recognizable that the Spongie you create is the Spongie mascot, but wearing a different expression or clothing.\n\n  \u2022 Use Spongie or the SpongePowered logo in an article or blog post about the Sponge project, and to spread the word.\n\n  \u2022 Use the SpongePowered Logo to link to Sponge Homepage (for example in your signature on forums etc.)\n\nYou may not:\n\n  \u2022 Use the mascot as a link to the Sponge project only. The SpongePowered logo (which retains Spongie\u2019s form) is a better representation of the Sponge project when used as an affiliate or reference.\n\n  \u2022 Create a vastly modified version of Spongie, where they become unrecognizable or clearly different from the original Spongie mascot.\n\n  \u2022 Add your project image to Spongie, or vice versa.\n\n  \u2022 Claim Spongie as your own mascot, or use them as a mascot for your own project.\n\n  \u2022 Sell or use Spongie in commerce without permission.\n\n  \u2022 Change any colors or dimensions.\n\nSpongie - The Official Sponge Mascot\n\nSpongie the SpongePowered mascot",
