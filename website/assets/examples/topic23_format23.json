        "text":"Garden Of The Gods \/ Keahiakawelo\n\n5 stars from 8 reviews\nAddress Polihua Rd, Lanai City, HI 96763\nA long, bumpy, 4x4-only trail is the only way to get here. Spectacular view all around once you do arrive.\n\n\u2022 General: Cost: Free \u2022 General: Photo Opportunity\n\u2022 Hiking: Hiking \u2022 Hiking: Nature Walk\n\u2022 Sightseeing: Great Views \u2022 Cultural & Historical: Heiau \/ Sacred Site\n\nMatt Anderson's Take\nKeahiakawelo, according to Hawaiian lore, is the result of a contest between two kahuna (priests) from Lana'i and Moloka'i. Each was challenged to keep a fire burning on their respective island longer than the other, and the winner's island would be rewarded with great abundance. The Lanai kahuna, Kawelo, used every piece of vegetation in Keahiakawelo to keep his fire burning, which is why this area is so barren today.\n\nSo that's the history of Keahiakawelo. But let's talk more about the present day reality of what the Garden of the Gods (as it's more commonly called today) actually is. It's a Mars-like landscape filled with all sort of rocks and boulders out in the middle of nowhere.\n\nSeriously, that's what it actually is: a rock garden. If you were expecting some sort of lush garden you will be disappointed but that doesn't mean you should pass this up.\n\nIt's about 14 miles if you are driving from the Four Seasons Resort Lanai at Manele Bay and about 7 miles from the main town area and no matter how you go it's about 6 miles of pure off road trail driving. We're talking dusty, dirty, bumpy, 4x4 only offroading goodness (even if you can only do 5-10 miles per hour the whole time).\n\nSo while the rocks aren't really a destination in my opinion, the real treat is the scenic view you get once you make the trip. Because it's an amazing view all around, including great views of Moloka'i island. So bring a camera but also pack in some snacks and plenty of drinks because you will be out in the middle of nowhere and likely won't have a cell single in some parts.\n\nPack extra supplies to be safe, and consider bringing toilet paper too because there are no facilities of any kind out here (and also a plastic bag to pack out what you packed in). That's right, hiking rules are in play so also ready up on Hiking Safety & Essentials just to be, well, safe.\n\nThis is a neat place to see and if you are on Lana'i and have a rental car (4x4 only) it's worth the trip but don't expect anything beyond scenery because you won't find it here.\nShare This On\nMatt Anderson\nAdded by on\n\nMatt A\nJoined: Feb 2013\nReviews: 790\nLikes Received: 106\nA pretty amazing place to see and the journey is part of the adventure. Go slow and take it easy and enjoy the trip there and back. Sure, it's just a rock garden but it's probably the most spectacular rock garden you'll ever see.\nBrett D\nJoined: Mar 2017\nReviews: 56\nLikes Received: 1\nWhile vacationing here we decided to rent a 4x4 and check out the Garden of the Gods. Didn't think to much about it as it looked like it was going to be nothing but just a lot of rocks, but once we go there I was awestruck, the rocks were fantastic. I took so many pictures of the scenery and loved the feeling of being in a place of isolation almost like we were the only ones left on earth. It can be a little rough of a ride but well worth it.\nKim S\nJoined: Oct 2016\nReviews: 10\nLikes Received: 0\nI guess I can't review Lanai as a whole so I will review via 1\/2 day trip from Maui via Trilogy Excursions. This was not a cheap trip by any means. $500 for 3 people but it was a worthwhile experience. The Trilogy ferry trip was 50 minutes each way. No commentary or conversation from the crew; simply transport. It was a relatively smooth trip, though my son did get a little seasick. I chose to ride outside, where I can see the scenery to keep my mind occupied and less inclined to notice the waves.\n\nWe chose the 1\/2 day Trekker excursion. This is the ferry to the island, where you are met by a guide in a 4x4 and taken to various sites around the island. Depending on how many people are in your group, the sites may vary. My son was very interested in the history of the island and what will happen to it now that it has been nearly bought out by the CEO of Oracle.\n\nOur guide was a native Lanaian who went by Uncle Tommy. We got a little more history than requested as he showed us his old home and an area called \"Snob Hill\" which took time into our other stops. We didn't really get to see much of Shipwreck Beach because of the delays but it was interesting nonetheless.\n\nGarden of the Gods was awesome and worth the trip in itself. We had to laugh at all the tourists who thought they would save a buck by renting their own 4x4 and do the tour themselves. Most of them were up to their axles in red sand and needed to be pulled out. So much for saving a little. Another stop was the new Four Seasons Hotel, which is a big part of the Island's new ownership and is actually a good thing for it's people. Honestly, Garden of the Gods was so awesome that if I return, I may try renting my own 4x4 so I can spend a little time hiking there. From what the tour guide told us, whenever a scene in Hawaii Five-0 requires a remote setting, the crew often heads to Lanai. With the exception of the massive hotels, it is an island more or less lost in time.\nSue K\nJoined: Mar 2016\nReviews: 196\nLikes Received: 9\nI loved The Garden of the Gods! We hired a jeep and hit the red dirt track leading us to this amazing spot. The stunning, desolate landscape is wild and windswept. You can see Maui on the horizon. The boulders and rock formations are cool and the colors unbelievable. We had the place to ourselves, which made it even more special. Definitely worth the bumpy journey.\nTeresa a\nJoined: Jul 2016\nReviews: 10\nLikes Received: 0\nLook for the stables and then get on the dirt track to Garden of the Gods. It's a fun, bumpy drive there and we had the whole place to ourselves. With views of Maui, the rocks of all shapes and sizes formed the landscape. It had the feel of being on the moon with the exception of the blue skies. Fabulous.\nDawn G\nJoined: Mar 2016\nReviews: 26\nLikes Received: 0\nIf you are on Lanai this is something you really should take the time to do. It's a quick drive through sort of thing once you're there. It does feel other-worldly and is a cool backdrop for photographs. As others have mentioned it's a bit of a long drive on a two-track road but getting there is half the fun.\nDewei T\nJoined: Aug 2015\nReviews: 20\nLikes Received: 0\nIt's basically the closest I'll ever get to Mars! What a neat place to see. Very windy out here and no bathrooms for a long, long way. See what I'm getting at here? Mind the direction of the wind if you have to empty your bladder out here! The ride here is pretty long and bumpy but also tons of fun. Gas up and bring food and water for sure.\nJoined: Apr 2015\nReviews: 21\nLikes Received: 1\nOne of the most amazing places to see in my opinion. It's like entering another world. The views here are just incredible in every direction. It's a bumpy trail getting here so rent a Jeep, put it into 4 wheel drive, and blaze a trail.\nMore Top Rated Lanai Places",

It's a great getaway for anyone, even if you're just looking to escape the Chicagoland area.\n\nWonderful stay!\n\n5 sur octobre 17, 2013\n\nMerida and Russell are wonderful hosts. After greeting us, they showed us around the house, telling the history and why the names of the rooms. They pointed out a refrigerator in the kitchen for drinks for guests and said there would be brownies and hot tea for us that evening. The room was spacious and cozy, beautiful bedding and nice plump towels. The breakfast was outstanding, the best we have had anywhere! There were even seconds if you could find the room! We will definitely be back.\n\nWe totally loved our hosts!\n\n5 sur octobre 11, 2013\n\nAttention to detail is the name of the game. If you enjoy seeing interesting old collectibles, then this is the place for you!\n\nSeptember 2013\n\n5 sur septembre 22, 2013\n\nThe rooms are lovely, the price is fair, breakfast was great. A very homey experience. Our hosts were very friendly and gracious and we were just 4 blocks from the square. No complaints and no suggestions for improvement. Everything was just swell.\n\nWoodstock Outing\n\n4,4 sur septembre 13, 2013\n\nComfortable room with excellent food and service. Will definitely come back again!\n\nAnniversay getaway\n\n4,2 sur ao\u00fbt 28, 2013\n\nWe had never been to a B & B until our recent stay at the Bundling Board Inn. They have quaint rooms. The breakfast was phenominal. The only down side to our stay was that the room we chose was in the front of the house. The B & B is on a busy street and I am a light sleeper.\n\nExcellent lodging and conversation\n\n5 sur ao\u00fbt 02, 2013\n\nLovely breakfast and good conversation with the owners.\n\n\n5 sur juillet 09, 2013\n\nMerida and Russell's B&B is just the greatest and so are they! Our stay with them was just wonderful.\n\n\u201cMetra Vacation!! Beautiful inn and wonderful hosts!\u201d\n\n5 sur juin 16, 2013\n\nMy wife and I stayed at the Bundling Board Inn back in November for a quick weekend away from Chicago to de-stress and we could not have been more pleased with the results. Merida and Russell were the perfect hosts and their home is quiet, comfortable, and charming. I've stayed in B & B's that are cloying, overstuffed, and overdone, but the Bundling Board is definitely not one of those. It is much more like the country home of a relative, not too precious, just comfortably familiar. Breakfast was hearty and delicious, and Merida kept us supplied with brownies and cookies baked especially for my wife's gluten-free diet. Woodstock is a great small town, with a number of good restaurants. I also treated my wife to a massage at nearby Harmony Falls and she found it to be superior to a lot of the pricier Chicago places. Therapeutic, relaxing, no-nonsense. I can't recommend the Bundling Board and the town of Woodstock enough. Treat yourself to some peace and quiet outside of the city.\n\n\n4,6 sur d\u00e9cembre 13, 2012\n\nThis was our first time at a B&B. It was a great experience. Our hosts were wonderful, the room was very nice and the breakfast was outstanding.\n\nWonderful friends and beautiful memories.\n\n5 sur novembre 21, 2012\n\nOn our 33rd wedding anniversary we decided to stay at the Bundling Board Inn. it is a beautiful Victorian house ,with wonderful innkeepers, Merida and Russell.As we entered the house we could smell the aroma of homemade chocolate chip cookies,they were very good.We stayed in the Mildred room it was beautiful room.We walked into town,it was less than 10 minutes away!We ate at the Public House the food was very good as was the service.The breakfast at the inn the next morning was fabulous !! Merida and Russell are wonderful people they made us feel like part of the family. Thank you ,Victoria and Timothy\n\nYou made us feel like family\n\n5 sur septembre 13, 2012\n\nMerida and Rus...
