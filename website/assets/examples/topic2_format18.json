But then necessity is false. For related reasons, it is hard to see how mere reflection on the case\u2009\u2014\u2009under some such description\u2009\u2014\u2009could give us justification to believe necessity .\n\nSomeone might object as follows: \u2018Why is it a problem for the target rationalist that the judgement she ascribes to us is false and unjustified? Surely it is still an open question at this stage of the inquiry whether any given intuitive judgement is true and\/or justified? Careful analysis of its content may reveal that it fails on both scores.\u2019\n\nLet me reply on Williamson\u2019s behalf: as I understand it, the problem is not simply that the candidate content is false and\/or unjustified\u2009\u2014\u2009the problem is that it is too obviously false and unjustified. Our intuitive judgements may indeed be in poor epistemic shape, but it would be highly surprising if it turned out to be this easy to reveal that they are. Indeed, it would be surprising enough if it were this easy to show that the Gettier judgement alone was in poor shape\u2009\u2014\u2009the usual presumption being that, if any intuitive judgement is in good standing, it is the Gettier judgement. But matters are worse, since parallel arguments are available for many other intuitive judgements. 22\n\nNext, the proposal under consideration is a psychological hypothesis about the content of our actual judgement, and as such it makes certain predictions that are not borne out. We simply do not behave as we would behave if the proposal were true. In particular, we do not take the possibility of the above realizations of the case to falsify our original intuitive judgement. And on the face of it, this reaction is appropriate\u2009\u2014\u2009it is not just a result of stubbornness or a reluctance to admit mistakes. Rather, the reason why we do not retract or revise our original judgement is that the envisaged realizations do not agree with our (semantic) intuitions about what the case designer meant . (By \u2018case designer\u2019 I just mean whoever put together the case description. The case designer and the thought experimenter may of course coincide.) These realizations of the case are deviant , and they are easily recognizable as such. That is, the corresponding interpretations of the case description are clearly unintended \u2009\u2014\u2009the description was not meant to be read in some such way\u2009\u2014\u2009and we rightly ignore these interpretations when running the thought experiment. And when it is pointed out to us that it can be filled out in some such way, we do not retract our original intuitive judgement or start qualifying it (e.g. by adding \u2018what I should have said is that Jones does not know\u2009\u2014\u2009 provided that there is no other route to knowledge available to him\u2019). 23 This suggests that necessity fails to capture the intended generality of that judgement.\n\nNote how even though all of the chapters in this example are added backwards, they come out in the proper order:\n\nCollections with a comparator will not automatically re-sort if you later change model attributes, so you may wish to call sort after changing model attributes that would affect the order.\n\nsort collection.sort([options]) Force a collection to re-sort itself. You don't need to call this under normal circumstances, as a collection with a AFVandevorst double breasted military coat Shop Offer WfxyXAaMOR\nwill sort itself whenever a model is added. To disable sorting when adding a model, pass {sort: false} to add . Calling sort triggers a \"sort\" event on the collection.\n\npluck collection.pluck(attribute) Pluck an attribute from each model in the collection. Equivalent to calling map and returning a single attribute from the iterator.\n\nwhere collection.where(attributes) Return an array of all the models in a collection that match the passed attributes .

Models within the collection will use url to construct URLs of their own.\n\nparse collection.parse(response, options) parse is called by Backbone whenever a collection's models are returned by the server, in Fendi Kan I small shoulder bag Recommend For Sale Cheap The Cheapest CZw1NUv\n. The function is passed the raw response object, and should return the array of model attributes to be added to the collection. The default implementation is a no-op, simply passing through the JSON response. Override this if you need to work with a preexisting API, or better namespace your responses.\n\nclone collection.clone() Returns a new instance of the collection with an identical list of models.\n\nfetch collection.fetch([options]) Fetch the default set of models for this collection from the server, setting them on the collection when they arrive. The options hash takes success and error callbacks which will both be passed (collection, response, options) as arguments. When the model data returns from the server, it uses Clearance How Much Golden Goose Deluxe Brand cropped polo shirt Outlet Pick A Best 7xPK2W\nto (intelligently) merge the fetched models, unless you pass {reset: true} , in which case the collection will be (efficiently) Elizabeth And James collarless fitted jacket Clearance Nicekicks Cno4dcZ\n.
