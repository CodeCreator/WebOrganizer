        "text":"Terms & Conditions\n\nTerms and conditions\n\nThese are the terms and conditions on which we supply products to you, whether these are goods, services or digital content.\n\nPlease read these terms carefully and in full before using this site or submitting an order. These terms tell you who we are, and about how we supply our products and services. They may change from time to time and without notice. The headings are for convenience only and do not affect meaning.\n\nWe are\n\nWe are Pain Care Clinic Limited, company number 7376424. Our registered address is 19 Grosvenor Mount, Leeds, LS6 2DX.\n\nContact between us\n\nIf you need to write to us, you can do so by post to the address above, or by email to info@paincareclinic.co.uk. You can also phone us on 0330 041 7271. Any calls made to this number from a UK landline will be charged at the local rate for that number.\n\nOur working days are Monday to Friday. We don\u2019t count public holidays as working days. Our hours are between 9am and 5pm.\n\nWe will use any contact information you provide to us to return calls or otherwise contact you.\n\nUsing this website\n\nThe content of this website is for general information only. You are welcome to contact us for more specific information and advice.\n\nPrices and orders\n\nPrices quoted include VAT and exclude delivery.\n\nWhen you place an order online you should receive an automated email from Worldpay or PayPal to confirm they are processing your payment, and another automated email from us to acknowledge your order and give you an order number.\n\nWe will then check and process your order. We reserve the right not to accept an order.\u00a0\n\nIf we do not accept your order, for example because we do not have enough stock or a workshop is full, we will tell you in writing and we will not charge you. We expect these occasions to be rare.\n\nYour order is accepted when we dispatch your products or confirm your booking. Acceptance of your order will create a contract between us and we will send you a full sales invoice.\n\nWe aim to complete our side of all contracts within 30 days, although we are usually much quicker.\n\n\nOur standard delivery charge is \u00a33.99. This covers Royal Mail second-class delivery of a small package up to 2kg, delivered to any single address in the UK. We expect this to be sufficient for most consumer orders. If your order is larger than that, you are welcome to contact us before placing it, or we may contact you about delivery method and any charges.\n\nUnless special arrangements are made between us we cannot guarantee delivery by a particular date and are not legally responsible for delivery by a particular date.\n\nDelivery and orders outside the UK\n\nDeliveries to European countries are charged at a standard rate of \u00a35.40, including VAT. This covers Royal Mail International Standard delivery of a small package of up\u00a0 to 2kg, delivered to any single address in the EU.\n\nDeliveries to the Rest of the World are charged at a standard rate of \u00a39.99. This covers Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed delivery of a small package of up to 2kg, delivered to any single address.\n\nUnless special arrangements are made between us we cannot guarantee delivery by a particular date and are not legally responsible for delivery by a particular date.\n\nYou will be responsible for the goods from dispatch and for payment of all import duties and other charges.\n\nLegal jurisdiction\n\nWe are registered in England and Wales and all dealings with us are governed by the laws of England and Wales.\n\nEven if you or your delivery location is outside the UK, we will not accept liability under any laws that apply outside England and Wales.\n\nAny legal action against us must be brought within England and Wales.\n\n\nWe source our own products and from time to time we may make adjustments or improvements. There may sometimes be minor variations between the products or packaging pictured and those supplied. If these minor variations are not acceptable to you, you can return goods under your cooling off \/ changing your mind rights.\n\nCooling off \/ changing your mind rights\n\nYou can change your mind about an order you\u2019ve placed or a product you\u2019ve received. If you change your mind please let us know as soon as possible by email to info@paincareclinic.co.uk.\n\nIf you inform us before dispatch of an item, we will not send out the product.\n\nIf you change your mind after you\u2019ve received an item, you must inform us within 14 days of receiving it that you wish to cancel your order. After that, you have a further 14 days to return the item to us.\n\nAll items returned must be unused, in their original undamaged packaging and capable of re-sale. You are responsible for looking after an item while it remains with you.\n\nYou are also responsible for returning an item to us. This includes choosing an appropriate method of return, and paying the costs of return and any insurance against loss or damage, if you wish to take this out.\n\nWe will confirm by email when returned items have been received by us and whether the condition is acceptable for a refund. Assuming it is, we will authorise a refund without quibble. We will refund the price and any standard delivery charges you paid.\n\nFor appointments and workshops the situation is slightly different, see below.\n\nFaulty products\n\nAs well as having cooling off rights or rights to change your mind about an order, consumers also have statutory rights in relation to faulty products. By faulty products, we mean products with serious defects or products that are not as described or are not fit for their purpose.\n\nYou can return faulty products and ask for either a replacement or a full refund.\n\nIf you intend to return a faulty product, please let us know by email as soon as you realise the product is faulty, as this can affect whether you are entitled to a refund or a replacement.\n\nOnce you have notified us that the product is faulty, please return it to us so we receive it within a further 14 days.\n\nIf a product is found to be faulty within 30 days of purchase we will offer you a full refund or a replacement.\n\nIf goods are found to be faulty within 6 months of purchase, we may offer you a repair or a replacement instead.\n\nCooling off rights do not apply to workshops or appointments if these are booked within 30 days of the start date. However, we will still try to accommodate a cancellation if we can. See Appointments and Workshops.\n\n\nWhere you are entitled to a refund for a cancelled order or faulty product, we will process your refund as soon as possible after satisfactory return of the relevant item. Occasionally, it may take us up to 30 days to process a refund.\n\nRefunds will be made to the card or account used for payment.\n\n\nAll appointments must be paid for in advance or on the day.\n\nWe sometimes have a waiting list for appointments. If you would like to cancel or change an appointment you have already booked, please let us know as soon as possible so we can offer the appointment to someone else.\n\nWe have a 48-hour cancellation policy. This means that if you don\u2019t give us at least 48 hours\u2019 notice that you wish to cancel or re-arrange an appointment, we will charge in full for the appointment. We will charge you even if we find someone else to take the appointment.\n\nWe can accept payment for missed appointments by card or bank transfer.\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse appointment requests or to cancel appointments.\n\n\nWe schedule all workshops carefully and with the intention that they will go ahead as planned. All workshops must be paid for in full at the time of booking.\n\nWe may decide to cancel a workshop, for example if we do feel we have enough bookings to make it a worthwhile workshop experience. If we cancel a workshop, we will offer you a refund or a place on another workshop.\n\nWe are not responsible for reimbursing any travel or accommodation costs you may be responsible for.\n\nYou can change your mind and cancel a workshop booking, provided there is still 30 days or more before the workshop is scheduled to run. You can\u2019t change your mind about attending a workshop after it has run.\n\nIf you cancel your workshop booking with less than 30 days to go before the workshop, you do not have the right to either a refund or a place on another workshop. However, if we have someone on a waiting list who can take your place we will exercise our discretion.\n\nMatters outside our control\n\nIf we cannot supply goods or services for reasons beyond our control, we are not obliged to offer you a refund, and we are not responsible for any losses you may incur.\n\nPayment and ownership of products\n\nAs a precaution against non-payment, legal ownership of products belongs to us until full payment is made.\n\n\nWe are entitled to charge interest on all invoices until full payment.\n\nLegal liability and professional accountability\n\nIt is always our intention to provide you with goods and services that meet legal and professional standards.\n\nWe don\u2019t limit our liability for defective products where it would be unlawful to do so.\n\nPrivacy and data protection\n\nWe are registered with the UK data protection registrar.\n\nWe respect your privacy online and offline. And we believe it is important for you to be able to access the information and help you need in confidence.\n\nFirst and foremost, we are complementary therapists. All our client healthcare records are confidential. We keep them securely. We will not disclose any personal client information unless we are legally or professionally obliged to do so, for example to prevent harm to you or someone else.\n\nAs well as being complementary therapists, we run this website.
