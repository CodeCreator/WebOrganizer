        "text":"8 Things That Giveaway Someone Carrying A Concealed Firearm\n\nLet\u2019s face it, even the most seasoned concealed carrier will sometimes find him or herself drawing a little attention to themselves and their firearms once in a while. After some time, the instances will become less frequent, but it\u2019s good to be conscious of the things we tend to do when we first start carrying.\n\nThis article is mostly for people who are new to concealed carry, or haven\u2019t even started carrying yet. It\u2019s good to keep these things in mind, because a lot of the time we will do them without even noticing. While many people wouldn\u2019t think twice about seeing you do these moves, some will know why you\u2019re doing them.\n\nAdjusting Your Rig\n\nLightly touching the firearm and\/or holster to make sure that it\u2019s in the proper position is something that we all do from time to time, but it should be something that we do in private. A restroom for instance, is a great location to make any necessary adjustments. The number one time that I find myself doing this is right after getting up from a seated position. When we sit, our rig can have a chance to shift a little bit, and it may feel like it needs some adjustment when we stand up. If you can, do this adjustment quickly and tie it in to the next point; the shirt tug.\n\nThe Shirt Tug\n\nA quick tug down on your shirt to make sure that your firearm is covered never hurt anyone, but making a habit of it will draw attention to yourself and that area (right where your firearm happens to be). If you are wearing the proper clothing to cover everything that needs to be covered, there should be no reason to \u2018tug\u2019 at your shirt. An exception would be right after you\u2019ve gotten up from a chair, in which case you may want to give your shirt a quick tug just to make sure it\u2019s in the right spot. Again, this depends on your current outfit and will not be necessary for everything. After that however, leave it alone until you\u2019re somewhere private.\n\nWith the first two points, if your rig is really out of place, you should realize this simply by how it feels. If you carry regularly, you should be very familiar with how your rig feels during your daily activities.\n\nThe \u201cMaking Sure It\u2019s Still There\u201d Move\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re new to concealed carry, this is something that happens often until we are used to carrying on a daily basis. It\u2019s usually just a quick touch of the back of the firearm while it sits in the holster. It\u2019s part \u2018make sure it\u2019s seated in the holster\u2019 and part \u2018make sure it\u2019s still there\u2019. It\u2019s also part \u2018unnecessary\u2019 because if you have a proper holster, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\n\nSome on our Facebook page even made note of the fact that they\u2019ve been guilty of \u2018resting\u2019 their arm\/hand on the firearm.\n\nPull Up Your Pants\n\nPulling up your pants is a little more difficult when you add a firearm into the mix. If you ever find yourself needing to lift up your belt and pants to a correct position, you may want to make a few adjustments. The first one would be to make sure that your belt is tight enough, and that you\u2019re using a proper belt for concealed carry. Remember that you have an extra pound or two (or more) that\u2019s being supported by your belt, so it\u2019s important to have a sturdy belt to keep things up.\n\nWearing Shirts That Just Don\u2019t Work\n\nI tend to put an emphasis on printing because I\u2019m not a fan. Some think that it\u2019s not that big of a deal and that\u2019s fine, but I do what I can to avoid any printing of my rig. The entire point of concealed carry is keeping it concealed and unnoticed so that\u00a0no one knows you are carrying.\n\nThe only way to tell if a shirt is going to work is to throw it on with your rig and check yourself out in the mirror. Some of your favorite shirts may simply not work anymore and should not be worn. If you see excessive printing, it\u2019s best to avoid that shirt and move onto another one. Or, throwing on another layer (weather permitting) may solve any printing issues.\n\nWearing Firearm Related Attire\n\nIf I\u2019m wearing a Justin Bieber shirt (I\u2019m not, I swear), chances are I enjoy her his music. If I\u2019m wearing a firearm-related shirt, chances are I\u2019m a gun owner. While it may not mean that I carry a firearm, it definitely supports the thought.\u00a0Be mindful of what you wear if you\u2019re worried about being profiled, because chances are you\u2019re being profiled.\n\nSome people will fight me day and night on this point, but I stand by my reasoning.\n\nPut it this way; if you\u2019re at the bank with two other people and you\u2019re the only one with an NRA hat and an \u201cI love the 2nd Amendment\u201d shirt, guess who the bank robber is going to watch the closest. Sure the chances are slim, but the reason we carry is so we\u2019re prepared. This is just another step in preparedness, and it\u2019s called blending in.\n\nNot Swinging Your Arm On The Side You Carry\n\nFor instance, if you carry on your right side, your right arm is likely to swing much less than your left when you walk. It\u2019s a way that we protect our firearm without even noticing that we\u2019re doing it.\n\nInspire others by sharing the link to this page on websites, Facebook or email!\nClick Here to Learn More Secrets!",

Here\u2019s an excerpt from the column.\n\n\nWe have so many people faking hate crimes that if you assume every one of them is a scam, you\u2019d be right more often than you\u2019re wrong. When you combine the liberal desire to get attention for being a victim with the possibility of making serious money on GoFundMe, it creates an enormous incentive to fake it. Add to that the possibility that what you do will be blamed on people you detest for not agreeing with you and there are liberals who are willing to lie. As you are about to see, there are a lot of them. I\u2019m giving you 10 examples, but the actual number of \u201chate crimes\u201d revealed to be fake gets up into the hundreds during this same period. Just to show the scope of the problem, I\u2019m only going to use examples from 2015 or later.\n\n1) \u201cThe allegation set social media ablaze, sowing shock and outrage as it went: Three black students at the University at Albany had been attacked on a city bus by a group of white men who used racial slurs as other passengers and the driver sat silently by.\n\nThe Jan. 30 episode, reported to the police, would draw hundreds of people to a campus rally against racism; an emotional response from the university\u2019s president; and even the attention of Hillary Clinton, who condemned the attack on Twitter.\n\n\u2026Surveillance videos did not support the accounts of the young women, Ms. Burwell, Alexis Briggs and Ariel Agudio. Neither did the statements of multiple fellow passengers. Rather than being victims of a hate crime, the authorities said, the women had been \u2018the aggressors,\u2019 hitting a 19-year-old white woman on the bus.\n\nAll three pleaded not guilty on Monday to misdemeanor assault charges; Ms. Burwell and Ms. Agudio, who publicized the episode through Twitter, also pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false report. The judge who oversaw the arraignment called the charges, if proved, \u2018shameful.\u2019\u201d\n\nOnce again, you can read it all here.\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nShare this!\n\nEnjoy reading?

        "text":"Types of Carry On Knife Sheaths, There are many ways in which you can carry your knife. The options depend on your comfort in carrying your knife. But if you are not sure what option you want, below are the other options on how people carry their knife around while concealing it to the public. Read the options in order to help you choose.\n\ntypes of carry on knife sheats\n\n1. Carry on Your Neck\n\nThe latest trend now is carrying your knife around your neck. Most of the knife carried around the neck is lightweight and has around 3 inches blade. The sheath of your knife is attached to a ball chain or a paracord which makes it simple to slip your knife on and off your neck. But this kind of carry on option has its own pros and cons to deal with.\n\nAlso read: How to Choose A Pocket knife?\n\nThe first con is carrying a sharp object where your heart and lungs are near. Do you think it is practical or safe? You might get caught into an accident. The pro on carrying your knife around the neck is you can conceal it from the public. You can hide the knife under your shirt and people won\u2019t notice you are carrying it around.\n\nBefore you select this option, make sure you weigh the pros and cons. In this way, you won\u2019t waste your money. It might be the best way to carry your knife but it does not mean its good for everyone.\n\n2. Clip on Your Pants or Shorts\n\nUsing belt sheaths are also popular because it is easy to put and carry around. But in case you don\u2019t have a belt, what will you do to attach your sheath? You can have the option in carrying your knife on your pocket. But if the knife is too big, this cannot be the option. During emergency option where you require your knife with you, there should be an alternative option to carry your knife around your pants without the belt.\n\nThe best way to do it is a clip or a belt loop. But the clip is the best way to conceal your knife while carrying it on your side. It is easy to put by just clipping it and you are ready to go.\n\n3. Attached on Your Bra\n\nFor women, the best way to conceal a knife is attaching it to your bra. It\u2019s the best way for a woman to be armed in public without others knowing she is carrying something. But this option is best rather than the neck sheath. Why? The knife is not allowed to move while the carrier is moving around, even when you are running. It will be in the same position throughout the day you are carrying the knife while concealing the weapon from others.\n\n4. Wear it Like an ID\n\nIf your knife is tiny, this might be a good option. A badge sheath is like a fancy badge ID that most teachers or health professionals carry. This badge is exceptional as it carries your knife. The best thing about this option is you can carry it easily and anytime but only with a small knife\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here",

But this isn't the first time that a spine-chilling crime involving a celebrity from the entertainment industry has made headlines.\n\nHere are some other cases involving Bollywood and TV celebrities:\n\nNeeraj Grover murder case\n\nGrover who was a television executive working for Synergy Adlabs was murdered in 2008. After investigations, it was revealed that a small-time actress Maria Susairaj along with her lover, naval officer Emile Jerome Mathew had murdered Neeraj.\n\nApparently Neeraj was helping Maria land roles in television soaps, besides shifting to a new house.\n\nMathew who was Susairaj's fiancee, suspected that Neeraj was living with her which infuriated him. He ended up stabbing Neeraj with a knife from Maria's kitchen. Later the betrothed couple allegedly hacked his body to pieces, packed it in a bag and set fire to it.\n\nGulshan Kumar murder case\n\nThe T-series music baron and film producer Gulshan Kumar was shot dead in broad daylight outside an Andheri temple by two men who pumped numerous bullets into his body.\n\nNadeem, of the popular music composer duo Nadeem-Shravan, was accused of plotting the murder. After investigations the Mumbai Police Crime Branch alleged that Nadeem had planned the murder in Dubai with Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim Kaskar. Nadeem presently resides in London.\n\nBrij Sadanah killing spree and suicide\n\nKamal Sadanah's (Bollywood actor) father Brij Sadanah, who was a successful filmmaker in the 1970s, killed his wife and daughter in a fit of rage at their Bandra residence in Mumbai .\n\nKamal was also shot at but he survived. The father then committed suicide on the same night. This entire episode sadly took place on Kamal Sadanah's birthday, when the entire family was wiped out.\n\nSandhya Singh murder case\n\nSandhya Singh who was the sister of Bollywood music composers duo Jatin-Lalit had gone missing in December 2012.

He used to have frequent fights with his mother and was also a drug addict.\n\nDivya Bharti's 'controversial' death\n\nKnown Bollywood actress and model Divya Bharti who was married to producer Sajid Nadiadwala, fell to her death from her five-story apartment building in Versova, Mumbai in 1993.\n\nFollowing her death there was much speculation by the media regarding Bharti's sudden demise, including the possibility of accidental death, conspiracy and even murder.\n\nEven after the investigations, the Mumbai Police failed to find any evidence against Nadiadwala. He was never charged for murder and the case was closed in 1998, labelling it as an accidental death.\n\nFirst published: 7 September 2015, 10:30 IST\nRaza Naqvi @Mir_Naqvi\n\nRaza is an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) and has worked with the Hindustan Times in the past.
