How are you measuring the volume in your fermenter? My other thought is how is the DME packaged? Is it generic and packaged by the LHBS or a name brand? Are they ripping you off and putting less in the bag?\nYes, five gallons. I use a little guage on the side of the fermenter. After having the problem with the first batch, I checked this to make sure it is accurate. The marking is a little bit off, but no more than a few cups.\n\nInteresting note on the DME, though. It's generic, and I haven't double-checked the weight on it. I'm pretty sure the LHBS owner is on the level (really cool, helpful guy), but that's definitely something to investigate.\n\nOn the water\/wort mix question, I'm pretty sure that it's mixed well when I take a sample, because I really slosh it around to aerate the wort. Perhaps next time, I'll use my siphon to get a sample from the middle, rather than from the top with a measuring cup . . .\n\nThanks to you and everyone else for your suggestions! In the meantime, I'll stop worrying about it, relax, and have a homebrew.\n\n\nReply With Quote\nOld 11-14-2006, 05:47 AM \u00a0 #12\ndantodd's Avatar\nOct 2006\nSan Carlos, CA\nPosts: 1,173\nLiked 11 Times on 9 Posts\n\nunfortunately water + malt extract = OG.

Bring them out and celebrate the spice! Even better, try a new spice or a new spice combination. Explore new regions of cuisine or revisit an old favourite. The choice is yours.\n\nFind a Mark Bittman recipe, from one of his books or online, that represents Spice Caravan to you.

All delicious. First authentic Italian food I have tasted in Belfast I lived in Sicily for 5 years,it was like being back there again. Service excellent Will be back and have told lots of friends about the restaurant\n\n  2. D.Marshall says:\n\n    Il Pirata is a great addition to all the restaurants here. However I always wonder when they are going to put up a nice big sign outside, or is that part of the 'look' ?\n\n  3. Lynn says:\n\n    Very disappointed when I visited, food mediocre and definitely not authentic! As for sitting in the window, yes in the window! Thought I was in Amsterdam!\n\n  4. T-bird says:\n\n    Yes I agree with D. Marshall above, the 'look' is damnable!!! Get it sorted please!!!!\n\n  5. T-bird says:\n\n    Oh and I also agree with lynn\u2026 Food far from great won't be rushing back:-(\n\n  6. kate says:\n\n    very disapointed when i over heard two cheffs only caught one of their names say that they did not want any catholics around thought them days were gone pity to i enjoyed the food\n\n    \u2022 mainliner48 says:\n\n      what a ridiculous statement to make\u2026absolute rubbish I'm sure\n\n    \u2022 Rachael says:\n\n      I very much doubt this is true, considering that ballyhackamore is a mixed area.\n      Just pure slander, no doubt from disgruntled competition.\n\n  7. Graham says:\n\n    @ Kate \u2013 that's a very big accusation to make. Can't believe you were so close to two chefs and they were discussing religion and came up with the old \"we dont want any catholics around\" statement. I say you are talking nonsense and you are being very mischievous with your inflammatory accusation. Shame on you.\n\n  8. Riichard says:\n\n    There was 7 of us. I enjoyed the casual ambience of the surroundings. I should have ordered more. the small plates were great!. When going back i will order more\n\n  9. Alex says:\n\n    Visited Il Pirata for a birthday dinner last week\u2026\u2026great place if you like eating in the dark. The lights were so low that we couldn't see the menu to order and staff refused to turn the lights up. they did bring a torch though so we were able to amuse ourselves during the long wait for food by making shadow animals on the walls. People were taking candles off empty tables and adding them to their own. All part of the ambience according to staff\u2026\u2026just like the toddler screaming non-stop at the next table. Verdict on the food \u2013 it didn't light up the evening, a bit like Il Pirata itself.\n\n  10. Colin says:\n\n    I must admit, I'm not a big fan of Il Pirata but SHAME SHAME SHAME on Kate (above) for posting such complete drivel.\n\n  11. Rab says:\n\n    Had a fantastic meal on Saturday 11th Jan, will definetly be back, we where a party of 8 of mixed religion don't think the comment made by Kate has any substance.\n\n  12. Richardthechef says:\n\n    Oh my god\" i came on looking for food..? I grew up in a mixed area in Belfast, I now live in England, I can't believe you guys are still going on about religion. One of the main reasons I moved to bring my family up I'm an area where no one cares what you are.. So is this place any good for food?\n\n  13. Rose says:\n\n    Had a lovely meal in Il Pirata but when are restaurants going to go back to ensuring the whole meal experience is as good as the food? The 'recycled' furniture thing has gone too far. I had to get up and go and get myself another chair as the one I was sitting on was so uncomfortable my back was hurting (they are all mismatched chairs which, for good reason, were discarded, possibly from 1950's schools\/community halls. I've encountered these elsewhere in places such as Made in Belfast so someone is obviously making money out of selling them off as 'designer' items.) The service was very good but not much ambience \u2013 trying too hard to be 'trendy'. I would love to return for the food, but will not, as I'd rather go somewhere more comfortable.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nPowered by WordPress \u00b7 Designed by Theme Junkie\nBallyhackamore and Belmont road Community news and information website",

There were periods when I stopped going due to major dust in the ceiling fans and an incident with the BLT. It was changed without warning to something that was unpalatable. Apparently the fake meat was not completely Vegan. I gave Native Foods another shot about 2 years later and found that I really enjoyed some of the sandwiches and pizza. Recently though the sandwiches and pizzas have shrunk in size! I completely understand that with the dollar devaluation and manufactured food shortages that food has gone up in price. I don't think anyone at this point is so naive that they don't realize the inflation we are experiencing especially with food and gas. I would much rather have a regular sized sandwich or pizza and pay the extra buck or two than to be deceived and given smaller portions. What in the world is that about?\n\n\nPosted by gr8vegan on Friday, February 22, 2013\nThe portion sizes are SO large we ALWAYS split what we get, if we're still hungry we enjoy one of their tasty desserts. I encourage anyone who hasn't been to completely ignore this review. Native Foods is a fantastic Vegan experience. Their bowls \/ pizzas \/ sandwiches are all very good, too good... This is one of the top Vegan stops in LA\nPosted by vegantruther on Friday, February 22, 2013\nWow \"I encourage anyone who hasn't been to completely ignore this review.\" What are you the happycow posting police? I actually agree with \"critic\" that the place has gone down. Too often on vegan forums and sites everyone is so quick to say how great a place is when it's just not so. When you speak your opinion you help a restaurant see its flaws. Saying that they're great when they have issues just encourages them to stay bad and\/or not rectify the issues. I'm glad that someone actually has the cojones to say what they believe. By the way - the Xmas meal really blows, but is better than M Cafes. BTW, I really hope Native Foods does address these issues because I've spent lots of $$$$ there and would again.\nYou must login to post a response\n\nLogin | Register (see member benefits)",
