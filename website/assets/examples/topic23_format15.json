        "text":"Thursday, August 9, 2012\n\nA guide to the rejuvenated Radiance Of The Seas\n\nThere are plenty of quality ships for cruise loving holidaymakers to choose from right now and the Radiance Of The Seas is well worth considering. The lead ship of Royal Caribbean's Radiance Class vessels has been radically rejuvenated at considerable expense and is now even more ship-shape than ever it was.\n\nAs a result, the Radiance hosts some of the latest dinning experiences offered on-board any of the world's great cruise ships. And you can't help but be impressed by the enormous nine-storey atrium that sits right in the heart of the ship and provides some really stunning views out to sea.\n\nThe feel on-board these days is one of spaciousness and relaxation. Although there are plenty of activities for passengers to choose from and a huge amount for children to get involved with each and every day.\n\nAmong the most impressive features of the newly refurbished Radiance is the Adventure Ocean element that has all manner of water slides and pools for energetic holidaymakers of all ages to enjoy and have a splash around in. There is also a state-of-the-art gym area, where passengers can have a go at yoga or tai chi, if the impulse takes them. Elsewhere there are sunbeds where the idea is only to take it easy and you can take in a newly released movie on a nearby big screen if you're so inclined.\n\nThere are cut-price deals on cruise holidays aboard the Radiance and a variety of other awe-inspiring Royal Caribbean vessels available online throughout the year. And if you're looking for a bargain deal on an excellent cruise Thomas Cook should perhaps be your first route of inquiry given the array of discounted packages offered by the company. You might just be surprised by how much cruise holiday you can secure for your money.\n\n\nBlog Widget by LinkWithin\n\nWorth Exploring\n\nMommy Chronicles @ Step It Up\n\nCopyright 2009.

        "text":"Exploring Manoa Valley\n\nLocated on Oahu, Manoa is a residential valley neighborhood. It is approximately 3 miles inland from downtown, close to Waikiki and Ala Moana. While it may not be on the list for tourists, it is a worthwhile spot to check out offering a look into one of Oahu\u2019s older communities.\n\nI learned that in 1825, Manoa was the site of the first sugarcane and coffee plantations in Hawaii. The word \u201cManoa\u201d is a Hawaiian term translating to \u201cthick, solid or vast\u201d perhaps a reference to the valley itself. The valley receives a high amount of rain, keeping it lush and green so don\u2019t be surprised if you see a rainbow.\n\nThe Manoa area is home to the University of Hawaii\u2019s main campus and some of Hawaii\u2019s most historic homes. One such building has been converted into a charming brunch spot called the Waioli Tea Room. Manoa Marketplace is the central shopping area and features a farmer\u2019s market several days a week. It is a great opportunity to mix with residents and support the local flower and produce farmers.\n\nClose by is Manoa Falls, an easy 3 mile round trip hike. The waterfall features a vertical drop of about 150 feet into a small pool. Please note that the water is not safe for drinking. The trail is well worn and travels through an amazing bamboo forest and features some unusual native plants. Another area to stretch your legs is Lyon Arboretum. This 200-acre botanical garden features beautiful trails and views of Manoa Valley. The Arboretum is open to the public on weekdays from 9 \u2013 4 PM and admission is free. I encourage you to make the trip to Manoa Valley and see for yourself why it is one of Oahu\u2019s most charming communities.",

From a Canadian perspective, that's more people than ALL of the provinces and territories outside of Ontario and Quebec. In one city. Woah. It literally takes hours to get from one side of the city to the other because of the volume of traffic - by day or by night - it is always \"rush hour\" it would seem.\n\nThe city, formerly known as Constantinople of course, is steeped in more than two thousand years of history, equal in scope and grandeur (though not quite as ancient) to that of Rome, or Athens. The most important trade routes, by sea and by land, between Asia and Europe came through Istanbul, and the ancient Persians, Macedonians, Greeks and Romans all defended it's location in their time, on the strategic Bosphoros Strait. It was a world city well before Prague, London or Paris were anything but villages. Everywhere you look there are historical wonders. At one time, the entire Roman empire was ruled from here, and the great Hagia Sophia was erected as the Holy See of Eastern Christendom (Byzantium) when that empire divided. Later, the Ottomans conquered and ruled from grand palaces here, for six centuries, erecting beautiful mosques, solidifying the Islamic faith as a world religion, and governing a surprisingly progressive empire (by feudal standards). This history built the foundations of the modern Turkish state which emerged, with revolution, in the aftermath of World War I.\n\nThere are no straight roads in the old city, nor even in the 'new city' (which is hundreds of years old). It's easy to get lost, and we did. Lots of times. There are outdoor and indoor markets in every neighbourhood (not just in the famous Grand Bazaar) and at each one someone will try to sell you a carpet, some knock-off name brand clothing, a hookah pipe, or Sahlep ( a delicious creamy hot drink). Apparently the hawkers and hustlers can sniff out Canadians - our hostel concierge warned us that our countrymen are far too polite and are known as easy marks. This is probably the same reason so many Canadians end up owning time share condos in Mexico, and the same reason we ended up paying someone 10 lire (about 5 bucks) to 'help' us find a recommended restaurant (it was one of the times we were lost).\n\nMy western sensibility - or perhaps sensitivity - was challenged by this at times; the smiling faces of the men who would strike up conversation and offer me tea only to turn around and try and sell me a carpet, or a tour, or a leather jacket. Their approach is dogged and persistent. Though I may not appreciate the style, I have to concede that in every culture, the job of the business man is to separate you from your cash. And so it goes. Be polite, be assertive, no thanks.\n\nOn another occasion, I was visiting the Suleymaniye Camii (Sultan Suleyman's Mosque,\u00a0which is every bit as beautiful as the Blue Mosque) and happened to be in the visitor's section when prayers began. I was not the only visitor in the mosque ('camii' in Turkish) at the time, there were many Turks wandering around like me, jaws agape in amazement at the grandeur and serenity of the site. However, I was clearly the only foreigner - and the government employed security guard singled me out. \"No visitor, prayer time,\" he said curtly, and kicked me out. Outside, I waited (just a little peeved) as Turkish tourists continued to file into the visitors section unimpeded. Finally, I plucked up the courage and walked back in. I found a spot at the back of the visitors section, between two Turkish families.... just to blend in... as if.\n\nHaving never been in a mosque before, I felt a little self-conscious as the Imam began the sung prayer - so I just closed my eyes. Having never heard Muslim prayers before, other than the distorted ones through the loudspeakers on the minarets of every mosque, I was at first surprised and then astounded by the beauty of what I heard. I did not hear the words, which I couldn't understand anyway, but only the ephemeral intonations of the soul - the pleading, lonely, tired heart - my heart, longing for release. I like to think of myself as open-minded, and now I was being carried in song, challenged to be open-hearted - confronted by my own fears and prejudice of this faith - and these people - about which I know almost nothing. The architecture and splendour of the domed mosque, such a feast for the eyes, is clearly and finely tuned for this moment of the soul. I was deeply moved.\n\nOutside the mosque, Istanbul raced on.\nSlideshow Report as Spam\n\nMy Review Of The Place I Stayed\n\nLoading Reviews\n  \u2022 Your comment has been posted.

        "text":"gather and grow\n\nHomegrown, hand-spun living in the city\n\nWe are in Delhi \u2014 acclimating, running some errands, meeting friends\u2026 and following the increasingly depressing news about the last week\u2019s devastating floods in the state of Uttarakhand, where we will be heading tomorrow.\n\ndelhi-2I\u2019ve spent years in India, and still its contradictions never cease to baffle me. There is much that I feel completely at ease with at this point, it all comes back as soon as I step off the plane \u2014 Hindi turns of phrases, how to navigate a crowd, how to cross the street without getting hit, how to avoid unwanted attention. But there are other aspects of life here that I can\u2019t walk through unfazed the way Indians seem to. Beggars with missing limbs in front of sleek boutiques, the filth surrounding a temple, an encounter with shameless rogues followed by an act of inexplicable kindness from a stranger, the way the air can be filled at once with\u00a0the most intoxicating scent of jasmine and the stench of urine.\n\nI suppose the problem is my own tendency to want to categorize things, rather than anything having to do with India itself.\n\ndelhi-3On this visit, it\u2019s the contradictions inherent in the question of sustainability in India that have made me aware of the limitations of my conceptual boxes. I grumble in my usual way about the fact that people here simply throw thrash on the street, expecting sweepers and rag-pickers to clean up the mess later. Then again, the total amount of waste in any Indian city is surely less than in your average American city. When we met with a Delhiite friend who is doing nonprofit work to advocate dry toilets that would save India\u2019s scarce resources and provide free organic fertilizer, the stories he told again challenged my notion that Indians are much more common-sense and less fussy about their waste than what I\u2019m used to. Before coming here, I had investigated the availability of organic food in Delhi \u2014 but as soon as I got here and had enjoyed the overpriced though satisfying snack at the Navdanya Cafe, I began to feel uncomfortable about the fact that my organic obsession is clearly a luxury most people here couldn\u2019t afford. I\u2019ve been happy to be able to take cycle rikshas rather than the horribly polluting auto-rikshas to get around, but am I really supporting a life-giving economy when it\u2019s another person\u2019s physical effort and even strain that\u2019s taking me where I need to go?\n\nAnd lastly, just when I had spent a morning observing the almost village-like simplicity of the food economy in the lower-income level neighborhood where we are staying \u2014 one-room dairies making their own yogurt in enormous vats, sugar-cane and lime juice pressers making fresh drinks, fruit and vegetable sellers presenting their fresh (and likely quite local) fare on their carts, small family shops throughout and no chain supermarket in sight \u2014 another friend insisted that we meet at the new Ambience mall south from Delhi, and I witnessed The Other Indian Economy. This was by far the largest mall I have ever seen: over 1 km in length, with an 867,000 square feet footprint and of course multiple levels. Inside the mall, along with over 300 brand retail stores and restaurant, were multiplex cinemas, an amusement park, skating rink etc. This is the New India that many of its inhabitants want to see. I found it disgusting in its excess. There really is no way to make a general statement about whether Indians live comparatively more sustainably than, say, North Americans. I guess I should just give up on that effort \u2014 it\u2019s a country of a billion people, after all \u2014 and start asking different questions.\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

I was lucky enough to be bought a trip to the top of the Shard by my parents for my birthday. I'd heard good things about it from other people, but only when I witnessed it with my own eyes did I realise how special (and high!) it actually was.\n\nThe Shard is currently the tallest building in Europe, towering above the City of London. It's quite amazing how tiny some of the large buildings and landmarks look from the top two viewing floors. The other thing that struck me is how the tall London skyscrapers almost lose their definition when looking down on them. They seem to blend into the cityscape and don't seem half as daunting as they do from the ground.\n\nBelow are a collection of photographs of London at night that I took on that very trip.\u00a0We decided to go just after sunset so we could see the bright lights of the city from above. If you like what you see then I highly recommend visiting it for yourself, you won't be disappointed!\n\nTower Bridge and the River Thames, looking towards Canary Wharf The streets of London below The Shard London Skyscrapers including the Gherkin, the Walkie Talkie and the Cheesegrater The River Thames and St Paul's Cathedral London Bridge Station platforms The River Thames and the London Eye The streets and buildings of London below the Shard",

        "text":"Archive for May, 2012\n\nTouring Ghana \u2013 Day 1\n\nThursday, May 31st, 2012\n\nWe had a week to kill before our reservations at Green Turtle Lodge, and no idea what to do with it. We don't really like big cities, and there is very little \u201ctourist\u201d infrastructure in Ghana, so getting around and finding places to stay wasn't easy. Inspired by Marie McCarthy's kindle book Travels in Ghana, we decided to hire a car & driver through one of the tour companies. We requested quotes from both Easy Track Ghana and Jolinaiko Eco Tours. In the end, we choose Jolinaiko largely because they had a much better price and seemed a little more flexible. Since we were returning from Benin, we wanted our tour to start in Aflao (the town at the Ghana border with Togo) and end at Green Turtle Lodge, where we already had reservations. The tour would serve the dual purposes of allowing us to see parts of Ghana we otherwise would not see, and it would allow us to get to Green Turtle Lodge without having to go back to Accra! In the end, we booked a 6-day tour, that involved visiting a Kente weaving village, an eco community, hikes to the second highest \u201cmountain\u201d and a couple of waterfalls, a palm wine brewery, a monkey sanctuary, a bead factory, the Akosombo Dam, a Lakeside lodge, and a slave castle. It was a busy 6 days.\n\nDay 1 \u2013 Aflao to Mountain Paradise\n\nWe took a car taxi from our hotel to the Ghana border. It wasn't far, but with all our gear it certainly made it easier to avoid all the border chaos on the Togo side. The actual checking out of Togo and checking into Ghana went smoothly. Just as we had arrived at a the border, we recieved a call from our driver, Fofo, saying that he had arrived in Aflao. So all we needed to do was walk away from all the touts at the border and find him. Having already arranged transportation made it much easier to get away from all the drivers offering rides to Accra.\n\nWe found it interesting that the border staff on both the Benin and Togo sides asked why we didn't speak French. In their experience everyone from Canada speaks French. We found ourselves repeating in our very broken French that only about 30% of Canadians speak French, and that most, are Anglophone. We suspect that because Benin and Togo are French speaking, it is more common for French speaking Canadians to visit here. English speaking Canadians are more likely to visit Ghana.\n\nInitially, we couldn't find the meeting place, but we were pretty obvious \u2013 two yovos standing looking at their phones \u2013 so it didn't take long for Fofo to find us. Soon, we were introduced to Fofo's beat-up 4\u00d74 Landrover (no air conditioning). We had been informed by Jolinaiko Tours that morning that the air conditioned 4\u00d74 we had been promised was broken, and that instead we would be using Fofo's Landrover for the day \u2013 with the other vehicle and driver to meet us that night.\n\nBefore leaving Aflao, we stopped at the bank machine to get some Ghana cash (Cedi). This time we used Eco Bank. At first, Becky couldn't get money, but soon discovered that it didn't work when she tried to enter a dollar amount, but worked fine when she just selected one of the values from the screen. The machine only let us take out 400 Cedi at a time (about $200). Since we had to pay the tour company in cash, and almost all our expensense would also be in cash, we each widthdrew 400 Cedi, and realized that along the way we would need to find another bank machine. In hindsight, we should have each done multiple widthdrawls (which we later discovered was possible). The Ghanian Cedi bills are thicker than the Canadian Dollar, so $200 in Cedi (mostly in 10 Cedi notes) makes for a crazy thick wad of cash!\n\nOur first tour stop for the day was at a Kente cloth weaving village. It wasn't really a village so much as a warehouse just off the main road. Becky was struck by how all the weavers were men. We paid a small fee to take pictures, and Scott took the opportunity to talk to some of the weavers. It takes them a long time to make a swath of cloth. Becky was surprised to learn that the cloth was made of a rayon-cotton blend. She expected it to be more of a traditional handmade thread.\n\nIt was 1:30 pm and we had not had lunch yet. Becky was starving. Our driver, Fofo, decided to take us to a museum before lunch. Since we paid an entrance fee for the not very impressive museum, Scott used that opportunity to ask the man there more about Kente cloth. After our quick museum visit, we headed out to a hotel restaurant for lunch. One thing to remember about restaurants in West Africa, when you order your food you can wait 60-90 minutes before you see it. Even if what you order is a \u201csimple\u201d dish. This certainly has put our local (Ottawa) Ethopian restaurants into perspective \u2013 since we are accustomed to North American restaurant time standards, we always thought the service at the Ethopian restaurant was really slow \u2013 now we realize that it was just authentic timing!\n\nAfter our late lunch, our day was not over yet. We thought we were headed towards our hotel as the day was getting on, but it turned out we were making our way to the village nearest the second highest mountain in Ghana \u2013 Mount Gemi. The drive up to the mountain village, Amedzofe, reminded us very much of a trip up to Monte Verde cloud forest in Costa Rica. The roads really needed a 4\u00d74 to traverse. There were a lot of hair-pin turns and rough patches, but as we climbed the views were spectacular. When we arrived in the town the weather was looking rather threatening, with thunder storms approaching. Rather than stop at the visitor centre, we picked up a guide and headed straight to the base of the trail. We would do the hike first, and then return to the visitor centre to register. Our 4\u00d74 made it most of the way to the top, leaving only a short 10-minute hike.\n\nThe hike and the discussion with the guide turned out to be the highlight of our day. The guide told us about his community and the neighbouring communities of the same \u201ctribe\u201d, six in total. They shared a language and were lead by the same chief. There were no trotros (mini-van buses) between the villages, and although you could see them all from the mountain top it was not easy to get from one to the other. To visit a neighbouring village you needed to hire a car and it could be over an hour drive.\n\nOur final destination for the day was the Biakpa Mountain Paradise Lodge. Unfortunately, the open air bar that overlooks the valley, which they are famous for, burned down the week before. It was a shame, as we could see the charred remains of the deck and the hillside that had burned. Fortunately, the restaurant was still operational and had a nice atmosphere. Upon arrival, we were asked to place our order for dinner. We would soon learn that this was a normal practice \u2013 ordering your meal several hours before you wanted it. After ordering and confirming how long it would take, we recessed to our room for a nice cool shower before supper. For supper Scott ordered ground nut (aka peanut) soup with chicken and fufu (ground cassava). Becky ordered stirfy vegitables with rice. When the food came, we both got ground nut soup with chicken, Becky got glutenous rice, and Scott got fufu. We would soon learn that even though something is on the menu doesn't mean they actually have it! Although this was the only place where they didn't tell us they didn't have it \u2013 they just substituted for what they had. Fortunately, the groundnut soup with chicken and rice was delicious.\n\nIt was our first stay in a \u201cbudget\u201d range hotel in Ghana, so we didn't know what to expect. It was certainly adaquate for our needs, but we were happy to be carrying our own bednet. This was the first night that we felt we actually needed it (we had used it at Marianne's but she also had netting in the windows and it wasn't really necessary there). In highsight, we would rate the hotel poorly. Compared to the other budget places we stayed in Ghana, it was expensive and not particularly clean.\n\nThe Kente clothe villiage. This particular place seemed to be the place where several different guides brought their guests \u2013 as there was another group of yovos arriving just as we left.\n\nA weaver at work.\n\nBecky climbing into the backseat of the Land Rover.\n\nA typical Ghanian school house. We found it amusing that the buildings were painted using the same colour scheme as the children's uniforms. The tan\/brown uniforms were worn by students of the government run schools.\n\nStanding atop Mount Gemi, as the weather moved in.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the cross at the top of Mount Gemi on the left side of the picture, and the rains moving in on us.\n\nThe charred remains of the bar at Mountain Paradise alongside a large terminate hill.\n\nOur hotel room with our bednet hung.\n\n\nCompared to Benin, the Internet we received from my phone was \u201chigh-speed\u201d.

In many ways that sounds more challenging than it actually is. Marianne arranged the first taxi for us \u2013 her usual driver picked us up and brought us right to the border. Since we'd been through the border in the other direction, we didn't find this border crossing at all challenging. We also saw the official price list for Togo Visa for Canadians and discovered that indeed we had not been ripped off. Our visas were 20,000 CFA each (a bit more than $40 CAD).\n\nFrom there, we had learned from both Logan and Marianne that after clearing customs we needed to just keep walking until we reached the area of shared taxis.
