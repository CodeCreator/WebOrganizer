Not only does it quote many of the great and the good in PR today and showcase the worst, it's basically an ethics manual every practitioner in PR should be forced to read. Massive thumbs up from me.\" (Sarah Hall Consulting, Founder and Editor of #FuturePRoof, CIPR President-Elect 2017)\n\n\"If PR is in the dock, I'd choose Rich to represent us over any large agency MD. He demonstrates how PR thinking can thrive on what's possible today, instead of 'the way things are done' or 'who you know'. He helps illuminate our industry from a dark art to a beacon in the modern marketing mix.\" (Max Tatton-Brown, Founder and Managing Director, Augur)\n\n\"Rich Leigh's passion, experience and creativity sets him aside as one of the top PR professionals in the country with a breadth of knowledge that belies his years. A must read for any aspiring PR guru.\" (Paddy Power, Head of Communications, Paddy Power Betfair)\n\n\"At a time when 'fake news' is a common term it's no wonder there's a lack of trust in PR. Rich Leigh is restoring the faith at a crucial time with his book 'Myths in PR'. It's an essential guide for practitioners, an inspiring read for PR hopefuls and an open door for anyone interested in 21st century PR. Let's bury the myths and enjoy the most exciting time in history for communications.\" (Stella Bayles, Director, CoverageBook)\n\n\"If I could marry a book, this would be the one! There is almost nothing worse than someone saying that all publicity is good publicity and Rich Leigh hits that myth head on. What's more, I have dedicated the better part of the past 10 years working toward changing the perception that people have of the PR industry (though Spin Sucks) and everything Rich writes in this book speaks to that vision. I love it so much, I wish I'd written it. If you think PR is just getting your name in the paper so the phone will ring, this book is for you. Buy it, read it, highlight it, read it again, and share it. Your business depends on it.\" (Gini Dietrich, CEO of Arment Dietrich and author of 'Spin Sucks')\n\n\"At a time when the telling the truth is a revolutionary act, Rich Leigh tackles misconceptions and strategy head on with facts, tact and wit. This book is required reading for current and aspiring communications professionals and, frankly, anybody affected by or contributing to the daily onslaught of misinformation; a practice exercised at present, most damagingly and disconcertingly, by even the highest offices in the world.\" (Nick Hewer, PR impressario, 'Countdown' host and Lord Sugar's aide on 'The Apprentice' and personal PR advisor)\n\n\"This is a candid, punchy and practical book. Buy one for your mum or your children when they ask what you do. Buy one for your employer to underline the value of public relations. And buy one for yourself if you want to advance your practice.\" (Stephen Waddington, Partner and Chief Engagement Officer, Ketchum, Visiting Professor, Newcastle University)\n\n\"Rich Leigh's punchy approach to dispelling PR myths makes for an entertaining and informative read. Is PR really glamorous? Do you have to be an extrovert to succeed in the industry? Can you make something go viral? Rich gives his experienced insights into all these questions and more.\" (Sarah Stimson, Chief Executive, Taylor Bennett Foundation)\n\nAbout the Author\n\nListed in PR Week's 29 under 29 list and named one of 'the brightest young social media communicators' in the UK, Rich Leigh has a rich and varied PR background, having led award-winning campaigns and household name accounts at digital agency 10 Yetis and consumer agency Frank PR.
