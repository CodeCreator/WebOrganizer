And it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.\n3 And David said to him, \u201cFrom where do you come?\u201d And he said to him, \u201cI have escaped from the encampment of Israel.\u201d\n4 David said to him, \u201cHow did the matter go? Please tell me.\u201d And he said, \u201cThe people have fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Yehnathan his son are dead also.\u201d\n5 And David said to the young man who told him, \u201cHow do you know that Saul and his son Yehnathan are dead?\u201d\n6 And the young man who told him said, \u201cBy chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.\n7 When he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I said, \u2018Here I am.\u2019\n8 He said to me, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 And I answered him, \u2018I am an Amalekite.\u2019\n9 Then he said to me, \u2018Please stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, because my life is yet whole in me.\u2019\n10 So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.\u201d\n11 Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, as did all the men with him.\n12 And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Yehnathan his son, and for the people of YEHOWAH, and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.\n13 And David said to the young man who told him, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d And he answered, \u201cI am the son of an alien, an Amalekite.\u201d\n14 Then David said to him, \u201cHow were you not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy YEHOWAH\u2019S anointed?\u201d\n15 And David called one of the young men and said, \u201cGo near and fall upon him.\u201d So he struck him and he died.\n16 David said to him, \u201cYour blood is on your head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, \u2018I have killed YEHOWAH\u2019S anointed.'\u201d\n17 Then David chanted with this lament over Saul and Yehnathan his son,\n18 and he commanded that they teach the children of Yehudah the song of the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar.\n19 \u201cThe beauty of Israel is slain upon your high places! How the mighty have fallen!\n20 Tell not in Gath, proclaim not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice; the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice.\n21 You hills of Gilboa; let neither dew nor rain be upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away; the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.\n22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Yehnathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.\n23 Saul and Yehnathan, loved and pleasant in their life, and in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.\n24 You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.\n25 How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Yehnathan is slain on your high places.\n26 I am distressed for you, my brother Yehnathan; very pleasant were you unto. Your love to me was wonderful; more than the love of women.\n27 How have the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!\u201d\n\n\nAnd it came to pass afterwards, that David inquired of YEHOWAH, saying, \u201cShall I go up to one of the cities of Yehudah?\u201d And YEHOWAH said to him, \u201cGo up.\u201d So David said, \u201cWhere shall I go up?\u201d And He said, \u201cTo Hebron.\u201d\n2 So David went there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.\n3 And his men who were with him, David brought up; each with his household; and they lived in the cities of Hebron.\n4 And the men of Yehudah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Yehudah. And they told David, saying, \u201cIt was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.\u201d\n5 So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, \u201cMay you be blessed of YEHOWAH, because you have shown this kindness to Saul your lord, and have buried him.\n6 Now may YEHOWAH show lovingkindness and truth to you; and I also will requite you this goodness, because you have done this thing;\n7 therefore, let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Yehudah has anointed me king over them.\u201d\n8 But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul\u2019s army, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim,\n9 and he made him king over Gilead, over the Asshurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, and over Benyahmin, even over all Israel.\n10 Ish-bosheth, Saul\u2019s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for two years. But the house of Yehudah followed David.\n11 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Yehudah was seven years and six months.\n12 Now Abner the son of Ner, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul.\n13 And Yehab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.\n14 Then Abner said to Yehab, \u201cNow let the young men rise up and make sport before us.\u201d And Yehab said, \u201cLet them rise up.\u201d\n15 So they rose up and went over by count, twelve for Benyahmin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.\n16 And they caught each one of them, their fellow by his head and thrust his sword in his fellow\u2019s side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.\n17 And the battle that day was very severe, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.\n18 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there: Yehab and Abishai and Asahel; and Asahel was as swift-footed as one of the gazelles, which is in the field.\n19 And Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left from following Abner.\n20 Then Abner looked behind him and said, \u201cIs that you, Asahel?\u201d And he answered, \u201cIt is I.\u201d\n21 So Abner said to him, \u201cTurn to your right or to your left, and take hold of one of the young men for yourself, and take for yourself his spoil.\u201d But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from following him.\n22 And Abner said again to Asahel, \u201cTurn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Yehab?\u201d\n23 But he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner struck him in the belly with the butt end of the spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died at that place. And it came about that all who came to the place, where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.\n24 But Yehab and Abishai pursued Abner, and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.\n25 And the children of Benyahmin gathered together behind Abner and became one band, and they stood on the top of a hill.\n26 Then Abner called to Yehab and said, \u201cShall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the latter end? And how long will you refrain from telling the people to turn back from following their brothers?\u201d\n27 And Yehab said, \u201cAs Elohim lives, unless you had spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone away, each from following his brother.\u201d\n28 So Yehab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still and pursued Israel no longer, nor did they continue to fight anymore.\n29 Then Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain; and passed over the Jordan, walked through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.\n30 And Yehab returned from following Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen of David\u2019s servants besides Asahel were missing.\n31 But the servants of David had struck down many of Benyahmin and Abner\u2019s men, and three hundred and sixty men died.\n32 And they took up Asahel and buried him in his father\u2019s tomb that was in Bethlehem. Then Yehab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at the break of day.\n\n\nAnd the war was long between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David grew continually stronger, but the house of Saul grew continually weaker.\n2 And sons were begat to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;\n3 and his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maachah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;\n4 and the fourth, Adoniyah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiyah the son of Abital;\n5 and the sixth, Ithream, by David\u2019s wife Eglah. These were begat to David at Hebron.\n6 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.\n7 Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, \u201cWhy have you gone in to my father\u2019s concubine?\u201d\n8 Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, \u201cAm I a dog\u2019s head, I who against Yehudah do show kindness this day to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hands of David; that you charge me this day with a fault concerning the woman?\n9 May Elohim do so to Abner, and more also, if as YEHOWAH has sworn to David, even so I do to him,\n10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Yehudah, from Dan even to Beersheba.\u201d\n11 And he could...

        "text":"Palm Beach, Florida at 10:00am\n\n\nLo and behold! The evil one is raising his head and breathing his last gasps of putrid evil upon the face of humanity. He is writhing in agony now for he knows that his future is cast in the prophetic words of the Bible of the Lord, in the prophecy that has been ordained for the plan of mankind as ordained by the Father.\n\nThe end is near for the reign of the evil one here upon the face of the earth. He has been tolerated for longer than the Son and Redeemer and his Mother Mary can bear. He has wreaked havoc upon humanity and is the scourge of the earth that has created so much misery and pain to the inhabitants of the planet, particularly for those of you who have become so enamored within the earthly life and its riches that you have become almost soulless in your nature, not even knowing of the existence of your God and of the Redeemer of the World.\n\nAlas! A new world is unfolding before your very eyes; a world in which the Redeemer is manifesting Himself more fully to you and ushering in the Era of Peace for all humanity for it is in these times when all humanity, all souls living on the face of the earth, will begin to recognize that He Who Is the Son of God is the Redeemer of all humanity. There is not one soul on the face of the earth who will be able to deny the existence of the Lord and Redeemer during these times for the way in which the Redeemer will convey Himself to all of you is so awesome that no one will deny His presence among you.\n\nThese are the times that have been prophesied to you by many of the chosen prophets of God from the earliest of times until the most current times. These are the times that the Mother of God, the Blessed Virgin is also manifesting Herself more fully to Her chosen ones. Many among you now are receiving Her messages and are being instructed on how to prepare the others to prepare for the Coming of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ for the time is short now and much will be happening across your planet and throughout the Universe that will give you the Signs of the Times that the time of the Saviour is now upon you.\n\nLook to the future with excitement and courage and you will not despair. Prepare yourself through prayer and fasting for the times ahead. Be courageous in your preparation for receiving the Lord. Recognize His Presence among you already through the reception of His Sacraments, particularly through the reception of the Holy Eucharist which is the most powerful gift of the Holy Spirit that had been ordained for you to bond in your eternal connectedness to the Lord and Saviour, Your Redeemer, as well as to God the Father, the Creator of all that exists.\n\nAs for the evil one, his days are numbered but he is also calling upon his legions and minions in these times to breathe his last breath of evil upon humanity. He will be defeated through the power of the Holy Spirit as well as through the power of the prayers of the servants of God here upon the earth.\n\nYou are being called upon at this time to pray mightily for the salvation of the world and the defeat of Satan and his minions. The time has come when the followers of Satan, many of whom are being deceived of who their master really is, are also being called upon by the evil one to spread more of his wickedness and evil ways upon the face of the earth.\n\nSatan has chosen his day of manifesting himself strongly and powerfully upon you. That day is June 6, 2006.\n\nYou are being called upon to proclaim this day as the DAY OF DELIVERANCE from the power of the evil one. Upon this day from its very beginning to its very end around the world you are being called upon to pray for the end of evil in the world.\n\nOn this day, June 6, 2006, you are being asked to organize prayerful gatherings, particularly to request an increase in the availability and attendance at Eucharistic Adoration. This is the day that the evil one has chosen to attack you and this is the day that the Lord and Saviour is calling upon you to make your stand against the evil one.\n\nYou are being asked to pray with your families and your friends, to organize gatherings among you to pray for an end to evil in the world. You are being asked to attend Eucharistic Adoration and to pray powerfully before the Consecrated Host from the very beginning to the very end of June 6, 2006 as it approaches and ebbs throughout the world.\n\nThrough the power of your prayers, you can force the evil one into the bowels of perdition. Through the power of your prayers, you can make a difference individually and collectively on this particular day to end the reign of the evil one on the face of the earth and to usher in the Era of Peace that has always been ordained for you by God the Father when He created the world and knew that you would fall by the wayside, only to return to Him through Jesus Christ, the Lord and Saviour, as well as through the intercession of your Heavenly Mother.\n\nSo, plan now for the Day of Deliverance from Evil. Plan your prayerful activities and events that will be designed to bind Satan and all of his legions and minions for on that day Satan and many of his followers will be cast from the face of the earth and bound up by the power of your prayer so that no more harm can be rendered upon the future of humanity.\n\nIt is up to you the followers of the Cross to be victorious on this Day of Deliverance. Pray mightily in preparation for this day and on this day to cast Satan and his minions out of your hearts, and minds, and souls, out of you family members, your loved ones and your friends, out of the sinister and evil leaders of the world who are reigning death and destruction across the face of the earth, and out of the many souls who are living in darkness, not even aware of their spiritual nature or even of the existence of their Lord and Creator.\n\nSet aside all of your worldly pursuits on this Day of Deliverance, June 6, 2006, and turn your day over to the Lord. Pray and fast for the entire day and prepare for the Coming of the Saviour for the time is soon.\n\nI am Michael, the Archangel\n\nEnd: 10:30am",

Please tell me what to say.\n\nI've bowed my head I have knelt down, But... should I be upright?\n\nI've closed my eyes, I've raised my hands, Or... should I fold them tight?\n\nDo I stand up? Should I sit down? Dear Lord... what do you like?\n\nAre lights turned on Or are they off? Maybe... candle light?\n\nWear my glasses? Take them off?\n\nBe at my desk or table? Should I whisper? Speak out loud?\n\nDo I quote the Bible? What do you think about the time?\n\nDo You prefer the dawn? Should I pray fast, Or keep it slow? Better short... or long?\n\nI'm new at this What are the rules? I want to do it right.\n\nHow do I know You'll even hear That I am in Your sight?\n\nAnd while I sat there quietly, Waiting for some sign, I heard a gentle voice say,\n\n\"Oh, dearest child of mine... Do you think I really care About the time of day, Or whether you are standing up, Or kneeling when you pray?\"\n\n\"I don't care about your posture, Or about the place you choose; Just open up your soul to me, I have no other rules.\n\nTell me what is in your heart, And tell me what you seek; Tell me of your sorrows, And of those things that made you weak.\"\n\n\"Speak to me in private About what concerns you most; I know about your good deeds...

The Pastor had shared about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man couldn't help but wonder, \"Does God still speak to people?\"\n\nAfter service he went out with some friends for coffee and pie and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked about how God had led them in different ways.\n\nIt was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home. Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, \"God...If You still speak to people, speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey.\"\n\nAs he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out loud, \"God is that You?\" He didn't get a reply and started on toward home.\n\nBut again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how little Samuel ran to Eli.\n\n\"Okay, God, in case that is You, I will buy the milk.\"\n\nIt didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and started off toward home.\n\nAs he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, \"Turn down that street.\" This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection. Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he said out loud, \"Okay, God, I will\".\n\nHe drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop. He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.\n\nAgain, he sensed something, \"Go and give the milk to the people in the house across the street.\"\n\nThe young man looked at the house. It was dark and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat.\n\n\"Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and if I wake them up, they are going to be mad and I will look stupid.\"\n\nAgain, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened the door, \"Okay God, if this is You, I will go to the door and I will give them the milk. If You want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something but if they don't answer right away, I am out of here.\"\n\nHe walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise inside. A man's voice yelled out, \"Who is it? What do you want?\" Then the door opened before the young man could get away.\n\nThe man was standing there in his jeans and T-shirt. He looked like he just got out of bed. He had a strange look on his face and he didn't seem too happy to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. \"What is it?\"\n\nThe young man thrust out the gallon of milk, \"Here, I brought this to you.\"\n\nThe man took the milk and rushed down a hallway speaking loudly in Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was crying.\n\nThe man had tears streaming down his face. The man began speaking and half crying, \"We were just praying. We had some big bills this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some milk.\"\n\nHis wife in the kitchen yelled out, \"I ask him to send an Angel with some. Are you an Angel?\"\n\nThe young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward his car and the tears were streaming down his face. He knew that God still answers prayers.\n\n~~ Author Unknown ~~\n\nBuy at Art.com\nThe Christ Child, St.John and Angels\n\nLaptop Batteries\n\nJoin SurveyPrincess.com for\nand make money doing online consumer surveys.

He then continued as follows, using his hands in\nthe grave and simple gesticulations characteristic of him:\n\nThere was once a Governor in Ancient Syria, who had a beautiful and\nclever wife. She was so capable that when the Governor died, she was made\nruler in his stead. The land prospered under her sway, and men\nacknowledged that she was a better ruler than her husband. After a time\nthe legions of Rome invaded the country, but again and again she drove\nthem out with great confusion. She let down her beautiful hair, and\nherself rode at the head of her army, clad in a scarlet cloak, wearing a\ncrown of gold, and wielding a two-edged sword in her hand. The Roman\nCaesar then withdrew his strength from five other provinces in order to\nsubdue her. After a long and brave fight Zenobia retired into the city of\nPalmyra, which she strengthened with wonderful fortifications, and there\nshe endured a siege of four months, Caesar being unable to dislodge her.\nThe food she had stored within the walls at last was gone, and the misery\nof her starving and plague-stricken people compelled her to surrender.\n\nCaesar was full of admiration for this great woman, because of her\ncourage and endurance, and he asked her to become his wife. But she\nrefused, saying that she would never consent to take as her husband the\nenemy of her people. Thereupon, Caesar was enraged, and determined to\nhumble her. He took her back with him in his ships to Rome. For his\ntriumphal entry a great procession was prepared, and the streets were\nfilled with people. In the procession came first elephants, after the\nelephants came the camels, after the camels came the tigers and the\nleopards, after the leopards came the monkeys, and lastly, after the\nmonkeys, walked Zenobia with a gold chain round her neck. Still she\ncarried her head high, and was firm in her determination. Nothing could\nbreak her spirit! She refused to become the Empress of Caesar, so she was\nthrown into a dungeon, and eventually she died.\n\n'Abdu'l-Baha ceased. Silence fell upon the room, and it was some time\nbefore it was broken.\n\nUpon another occasion 'Abdu'l-Baha said to a group of friends around him:\nTaken in general, women today have a stronger sense of religion than men.\nThe woman's intuition is more correct; she is more receptive and her\nintelligence is quicker. The day is coming when woman will claim her\nsuperiority to man.\n\nWoman has everywhere been commended for her faithfulness. After the Lord\nChrist suffered, the disciples wept, and gave way to their grief. They\nthought that their hopes were shattered, and that the Cause was utterly\nlost, till Mary Magdalene came to them and strengthened them saying: 'Do\nyou mourn the body of Our Lord or His Spirit? If you mourn His Spirit, you\nare mistaken, for Jesus lives! His Spirit will never leave us!' Thus\nthrough her wisdom and encouragement the Cause of Christ was upheld for\nall the days to come. Her intuition enabled her to grasp the spiritual\n\n'Abdu'l-Baha then added: But in the sight of God sex makes no difference.\nHe or she is greatest who is nearest to God.\n\nOne morning 'Abdu'l-Baha, on entering the room looked about and said: It\nis just like a miracle, our being here together. There is no racial,\npolitical or patriotic tie. We are drawn together by the words of\nBaha'u'llah, and in like manner will all the races of the earth be drawn\ntogether. Of this, rest assured!\n\nNext: The True Baha'i\n\nPrevious: Woman's Work\n\nAdd to Add to Reddit Add to Digg Add to Add to Google Add to Twitter Add to Stumble Upon\nAdd to Informational Site Network",
