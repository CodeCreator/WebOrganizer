        "text":"Adventure Time with Finn and Jake Wiki\n\nThe Fool\n\n2,818pages on\nthis wiki\nAdd New Page\nTalk0 Share\n\nThe Fool was a vampire gnome and a member of the Vampire King's court.\n\n\nMarceline fought The Fool centuries ago when she was on a mission to protect the remaining humans from vampires. While most vampires are malevolent, The Fool is more of a mischievous child; in one of his witless misadventures, he lost one of his fangs to a box turtle. Despite this, he is still a vampire which means he subsists on human blood. He is one of the first vampires Marceline ever targeted, and while she hunted him with deadly earnest, he regarded the whole thing as a game of tag. Marceline managed to defeat him and gain his power of flight and levitation.\n\nThe vampires are resurrected after Princess Bubblegum removes Marceline's vampire essence from her. After a short period, the Vampire King and his court manifest. While the other members of the vampire court debate what to do, The Fool proposes taking things easy, suggesting that they just get an apartment. Most of the court part ways with the group, but The Fool hangs around with the king.\n\nThe Fool is the first vampire Marceline kills in stakes in Vamps About. Marceline dispatches with him with absolutely no effort. The Fool casually shrugs off being stabbed in his usual carefree fashion.\n\n\nThe Fool has the body of a gnome with long, noodly limbs on a short, round frame. He has a Petit Goatee style beard, a single fang, light blue eyes with diamond-shaped pupils, and dresses barefoot with a grey, long-sleeved shirt, dark, navy pants dress, and a similarly colored pointy hat.\n\n\nAs a vampire with magical powers, the Fool can levitate and fly by his own means.\n\n\n  \u2022 He is named after the unnumbered trump or Major Arcana card in traditional Tarot decks. The Fool card represents innocence, spontaneity, and free-spiritedness. Similarly, Fool behaves like an incautious, carefree child. In the reversed position, the card can represent recklessness or a disregard obvious dangers, which is what leads to the eponymous vampire's downfall.\n  \u2022 He is seen playing a bongo with the others in \"Vamps About\"\n  \u2022 Jake describes him looking as if \"a baby snake was a baby baby\".\n  \u2022 The Fool had both his fangs when he was revived, but the Vampire King ripped it out of his mouth.\n  \u2022 He is the only vampire not to be encountered by Finn and Bonnibel, as well as the only vampire to stay with the Vampire King.\n\nAd blocker interference detected!\n\nWikia is a free-to-use site that makes money from advertising.

        "text":"NOT SO MANY YEARS AGO, film directors were downright orgasmic if they were paid a million bucks to direct a movie. Now, that\u2019s considered \u201cscale\u201d by many filmmakers.\n\nLately, the million-dollar summit has been scaled by another unlikely group: screenwriters and novelists. Not only are these ink-stained wretches earning seven-figure packages for their work, but they\u2019re also making the sort of gross deals previously reserved for superstars. Even more unthinkable, they\u2019re gaining a degree of creative control.\n\nThe examples are bountiful: William Goldman, who was paid a paltry $ 400,000 for his original \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d will earn well over a million bucks from Universal to adapt John Grisham\u2019s \u201cThe Chamber.\u201d The studio laid out $ 3.75 million for the thriller \u2014 the most ever paid for an (at the time) unpublished book. Goldman also serves as an occasional \u201cmentor-at-large\u201d for that lively minimajor, Castle Rock, which has been making a lot of news lately.\n\nThen there\u2019s Ted Tally, who\u2019s pulling down another million to adapt \u201cThe Juror\u201d for Columbia. And that\u2019s chicken feed compared with the latest coup for that prolific scriptmeister, Joe Eszterhas. Gonzo Joe sold \u201cForeplay\u201d to Savoy for $ 3.5 million, but, more importantly, the complex deal entitles him to 2.5% of first dollar gross along with a very favorable cut of video income and even a percentage of earnings from music.\n\nWHILE THESE MEGABUCK WRITERS DEALS may seem excessive to some, there\u2019s a logic behind them that\u2019s worth pondering. The reason movie stars make the big bucks, after all, isthat they supposedly \u201copen\u201d a picture. Given the fact that writers like Tom Clancy, John Grisham and Michael Crichton sell as many as 2 million books inhardcover, it can be argued that their names can open a picture as well. Hence a Crichton will pull down $ 3.5 million for the rights to \u201cDisclosure\u201d as well as for his producing services on the film.\n\nSimilarly, to companies like Carolco or Cinergi, Eszterhas\u2019 name arguably is a significant help in foreign presales. If a writer can help raise upfront money, that clearly counts for something.\n\nThese developments are shaking up the dealmaking machinery around Hollywood. Agents are reevaluating their strategies, fearful of underpricing their projects. Grisham\u2019s representatives, for example, are likely going for gross participation for his book \u201cA Time to Kill,\u201d which has attracted a lot of attention. The agents for the idiosyncratic Pat Conroy, who wrote \u201cPrince of Tides,\u201d are demanding millions for his next novel, \u201cBeach Music,\u201d even tying it into an original script he cranked out six years ago.\n\nThe studios find all this rather unnerving. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the Eszterhas deal is going to generate similar demands from star writers,\u201d says the production chief of a major studio. \u201cI don\u2019t want to break the barrier on gross deals \u2014 but I know the goddamn barrier has already been broken.\u201d\n\nEVEN BEFORE GONZO JOE\u2019S BREAKTHROUGH, writers\u2019 deals at studios had been escalating rapidly. The top body-and-fender men are making $ 100,000 a week and up to patch up scripts being readied for production. When a star demands a rewrite by a John Patrick Shanley, the pricetag can run to $ 800,000. Jeffrey Boam reportedly was making almost a million bucks a year at Warners for his scripts and rewrites; now he has switched to Paramount, where he has a rich writer-producer deal, and the studio is delighted with his draft of \u201cThe Phantom.\u201d\n\nParamount also has a rich deal with John Bishop, who lent his talents to \u201cBeverly Hills Cop III\u201d and \u201cDrop Zone.\u201d There\u2019s a dark side to this boom, how-ever. \u201cWhile some writers-du-jour may be scoring spectacular deals, the middle-range writer is having trouble getting work at all,\u201d says one of the town\u2019s top literary agents. \u201cThere are guys out there with major credits who are taking substantial pay cuts.\u201d\n\nWhen a writer hits a hot streak, the big question is, how high should he set his sights? A gross deal a la Eszterhas presents one glossy goal, to be sure. Greater creative control is even more attractive to others. Michael Crichton, for example, agreed to sell \u201cDisclosure\u201d with the proviso that he also serve as producer. This gave him a major say in the choice of director and cast.\n\nNow that Barry Levinson has started shooting the film, however, Crichton, ever the realist, is not exactly lingering around the set arguing about setups. Instead he\u2019s doing exactly what a writer should do \u2014 he\u2019s in Hawaii hammering away on his next project. Such a writer understands full well that ultimate creative control, now and forever, resides with the bozo who shouts \u201cAction.\u201d\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?
