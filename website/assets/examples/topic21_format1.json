This free event is for ages 4 and older. Register at 1-800-859-2960.\n\n\u220e Jurassic Roadshow \u201cHome Team\u201d The quiet, wooded Barton Cove peninsula once rang with the sounds of men hammering out slabs of sandstone from Lily Pond and other small quarries. These laborers unearthed dinosaur tracks, insect trails, raindrop impressions, and other trace fossils created during the Jurassic period, when marks in sandy mud hardened into rock and formed a record of what this land was like nearly 200 million years ago. Lily Pond quarry is now underwater, but one old quarry site is still in the open air. Join us on Saturday, May 4, from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. for a few hours with Jurassic Roadshow, a team of experts who share their fascinating collections of these special fossils and answer questions about the creatures that made them and the geology that preserved them. Bring in your rocks and fossils from home to stump the experts! There will also be a guided walk to the old quarry, where you can learn about how the tracks were discovered and quarried and how they made their way into museums in American and European cities. See fossils and talk with experts from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Quarry walks will be at 10:30 for families and 12:30 for adults, or feel free to use the Barton Cove Quest map available on site and discover the quarry on your own. Jurassic Roadshow is a project of Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association (Deerfield), funded in part by an Adams Grant from the Massachusetts Cultural Council. This free event is appropriate for all ages. Barton Cove is located on Route 2 in Gill. No registration is required, but if you have any questions, please call Northfield Mountain Recreation and Environmental Center at 1-800-859-2960.\n\n\u220e Fitness Hike on the New England National Scenic Trail. The woods should be bursting with birdsong and late spring wildflowers on this 5.5 mile hike along the trail formerly known as the M-M trail. On Saturday, May 18, from 9 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. Northfield Mountain Recreation and Environmental Center staff will lead the hike which begins in the town of Erving and travels through hemlock forests to the oaky woods on the ledges above the Millers River with a view of the River and east to Mount Wachusett. The group will then continue to Briggs Brook above the village of Farley, where a connector trail leads to the Northfield Mountain trail system. A second viewpoint atop the Mountain looks north to Southern Vermont with a view of the Northfield Mountain Station upper reservoir. Hikers will finally descend along the scenic Rose Ledge foot trail to the Northfield Mountain Visitor Center. Participants will meet at Northfield Mountain and carpool to the hike start location and should wear sturdy, closed-toed shoes, and bring lunch, water and trail snacks to enjoy along the way. Long pants, sleeves, a hat and bug spray may also be desired. People who participate in aerobic exercise three times per week or more will be a good fit for this program.
