All rights reserved. IMPORTANCE Recently, a rare variant in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) was described in a population from Iceland. This variant, in which alanine is replaced by threonine at position 673 (A673T), appears to protect against late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). We evaluated the frequency of this variant in AD cases and cognitively normal controls to determine whether this variant will significantly contribute to risk assessment in individuals in the United States.OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of the APP A673T variant in a large group of elderly cognitively normal controls and AD cases from the United States and in 2 case-control cohorts from Sweden.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case-control association analysis of variant APP A673T in US and Swedish white individuals comparing AD cases with cognitively intact elderly controls. Participants were ascertained at multiple university-associated medical centers and clinics across the United States and Sweden by study-specific samplingmethods. They were from case-control studies, community-based prospective cohort studies, and studies that ascertained multiplex families from multiple sources.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Genotypes for the APP A673T variantwere determined using the Infinium HumanExome V1 Beadchip (Illumina, Inc) and by TaqMan genotyping (Life Technologies).RESULTS The A673T variant genotypes were evaluated in 8943 US AD cases, 10 480 US cognitively normal controls, 862 Swedish AD cases, and 707 Swedish cognitively normal controls.We identified 3 US individuals heterozygous for A673T, including 1 AD case (age at onset, 89 years) and 2 controls (age at last examination, 82 and 77 years). The remaining US samples were homozygous for the alanine (A673) allele. In the Swedish samples, 3 controls were heterozygous for A673T and all AD cases were homozygous for the A673 allele. We also genotyped a US family previously reported to harbor the A673T variant and found a mother-daughter pair, both cognitively normal at ages 72 and 84 years, respectively, who were both heterozygous for A673T; however, all individuals with AD in the family were homozygous for A673.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The A673T variant is extremely rare in US cohorts and does not play a substantial role in risk for AD in this population. This variant may be primarily restricted to Icelandic and Scandinavian populations.\n  \u2022 Published In\n\n  \u2022 JAMA Neurology\u00a0 Journal\n  \u2022 Digital Object Identifier (doi)\n\n    Pubmed Id\n\n  \u2022 20137071\n  \u2022 Author List\n\n  \u2022 Wang LS; Naj AC; Graham RR; Crane PK; Kunkle BW; Cruchaga C; Gonzalez Murcia JD; Cannon-Albright L; Baldwin CT; Zetterberg H\n  \u2022 Start Page\n\n  \u2022 209\n  \u2022 End Page\n\n  \u2022 216\n  \u2022 Volume\n\n  \u2022 72\n  \u2022 Issue\n\n  \u2022 2",

(bluebottle or Portuguese Man-of-War) stings.\n\nDesign: Open-label, randomised comparison trial. Primary analysis was by intention to treat, with secondary analysis of nematocyst-confirmed stings. One halfway interim analysis was planned.\n\nSetting: Surf lifesaving first aid facilities at two beaches in eastern Australia from 30\u00a0December 2003\u00a0to 5\u00a0March 2005.\n\nParticipants: 96\u00a0subjects presenting after swimming in the ocean for treatment of an apparent sting by a bluebottle.\n\nInterventions: Hot water immersion (45\u00b0C) of the affected part versus ice pack application.\n\nMain outcome measures: The primary outcome was a clinically important reduction in pain as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were the development of regional or radiating pain, frequency of systemic symptoms, and proportion with pruritus or rash on follow-up.\n\nResults: 49\u00a0patients received hot water immersion and 47\u00a0received ice packs. The two groups had similar baseline features, except patients treated with hot water had more severe initial pain (VAS [mean \u00b1 SD]: 54\u00a0\u00b1 22\u00a0mm versus 42\u00a0\u00b1 22\u00a0mm). After 10\u00a0minutes, 53% of the hot water group reported less pain versus 32% treated with ice (21%; 95% CI, 1%\u201339%; P = 0.039). After 20\u00a0minutes, 87% of the hot water group reported less pain versus 33% treated with ice (54%; 95% CI, 35%\u201369%; P = 0.002). The trial was stopped after the halfway interim analysis because hot water immersion was shown to be effective (P = 0.002). Hot water was more effective at 20\u00a0minutes in nematocyst-confirmed stings (95% versus 29%; P = 0.002). Radiating pain occurred less with hot water (10% versus 30%; P = 0.039). Systemic effects were uncommon in both groups.\n\nConclusions: Immersion in water at 45\u00b0C for 20\u00a0minutes is an effective and practical treatment for pain from bluebottle stings.\n\nThousands of bluebottle (Physalia sp.) stings occur each year in Australia.1 Stings cause immediate, intense pain that usually resolves within an hour and is associated with a characteristic linear erythematous eruption (Box 1).2 The first aid management of bluebottle stings is a daily problem for surf lifesavers. Currently, most first aid bodies, including the International Life Saving Federation,3 recommend treatment by topical application of ice packs. There is little scientific evidence to support this,2 and the only study to investigate ice packs was observational with no objective measure of pain, or control or comparator treatment.4\n\nMany marine venoms are heat-labile in vitro.5-8 It is feasible that heat penetrates the human dermis to the estimated depth that nematocysts inject toxins (100\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcm),1 and recent clinical research suggests heat may be effective for treating jellyfish stings.9,10 However, previous studies of heat therapy were small10,11 or not randomised,11,12 and only one was published in full.12 A randomised controlled trial showed that, compared with ice packs, hot showers significantly reduced pain and treatment duration for bluebottle stings.10\n\nIf heat is to be used, it needs to be applied continuously. Furthermore, it has to be easily and rapidly administered at the beach. The risk of burns is temperature- and time-dependent, and superficial burns have been reported only with skin exposures longer than 1\u00a0hour and with temperatures over 46\u00b0C.13 Therefore, we chose immersion of the sting site in 45\u00b0C water for 20\u00a0minutes as an appropriate safe treatment for bluebottle stings, and compared this with the currently recommended treatment using ice packs.\n\nStudy design\n\nThe study was a randomised open-label comparison of hot water immersion (45\u00b0C) versus ice packs for treating pain from bluebottle stings. Patients were randomly assigned either hot water immersion or application of ice packs.\n\nThe Hunter Area Research Ethics Committee and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Newcastle approved the study.\n\nStudy patients\n\nFrom 30\u00a0December 2003\u00a0to 5\u00a0March 2005, subjects were recruited from two surf lifesaving first aid facilities in Newcastle. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or, if under 16\u00a0years of age, their parent or guardian.\n\nSubjects presenting for treatment of an apparent bluebottle sting were eligible for the study. They were included if they had immediate localised pain and observed a bluebottle, or they had the characteristic linear wheal and flare reaction. Children under the age of 8\u00a0years were ineligible as the visual analogue scale (VAS: the tool we used for assessing the primary outcome measure) is not validated for this age group.15 Patients were also excluded if they had a sting to the eye or appeared sufficiently unwell that ambulance attention was required.\n\n\nSubjects were randomly allocated in a 1\u00a0: 1\u00a0ratio to a treatment group after agreeing to stay for 20\u00a0minutes and consenting to the study. They were randomised to receive either hot water immersion or ice packs, using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes containing the study documents stamped with either \u201cwarm\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d to indicate treatment. Randomisation was in blocks of six (AABABB, BABAAB, etc.) divided into two separate groups for the two beaches using a computer-generated sequence of random numbers. Blinding of the patients or investigators was not possible due to the types of treatments. However, to ensure allocation concealment, the envelopes were not opened until after the patient consented.\n\nStudy procedure\n\nPatients were enrolled by the investigators or paid study assistants, the latter receiving training before enrolling patients. Personnel were present at study sites for most days when conditions were appropriate for bluebottle stings. Following baseline assessment, the allocated treatment was undertaken. After 20\u00a0minutes, subjects were offered crossover to the opposite treatment.\n\nHot water treatment consisted of immersion of the affected body part in water at 45\u00b0C for 20\u00a0minutes. Water was delivered by hose to truncal stings or into a large bucket for limb immersion. Accurate water temperature was ensured by using thermostatic mixing valves (Aquablend 2000, Enware Australia Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW), which both surf lifesaving clubs allowed to be connected to the hot water system. Water temperature was checked daily by spirit thermometer to ensure accurate calibration (accuracy \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C).\n\nIce pack treatment consisted of placing disposable ice packs (Glad, Sydney, NSW) from a portable freezer at \u22124\u00b0C onto the affected area for as long as the patient could tolerate during the 20-minute period.\n\nCollection of data\n\nBaseline data included sex, age and sting site. The patient was also asked to score their initial pain on a VAS. Patients were instructed to make a single vertical mark on a horizontal, ungraduated 100\u00a0mm line labelled \u201cNo pain\u201d at the left end and \u201cWorst pain possible\u201d at the right end. Subsequent VAS scores were recorded 10\u00a0and 20\u00a0minutes after commencement of treatment. Investigators also recorded the presence of radiating pain, generalised pain, nausea or vomiting, and respiratory symptoms.\n\nAdhesive tape (3M, St Paul, Minn, USA) was placed over the sting site and then stuck to a numbered microscope slide.16 Nematocysts were identified microscopically by one author (J E S) using cnidome libraries.\n\nSubjects were telephoned about 24\u00a0hours after presentation and asked about systemic symptoms, persistent pain, itchiness or rash. If symptoms persisted, subjects were followed up until the symptoms resolved.\n\n\nThe primary outcome for the study was a clinically important reduction in pain 10\u00a0and 20\u00a0minutes after treatment. A clinically important reduction in pain was taken to be the reduction in the VAS score equivalent to the patient description of \u201ca lot better\u201d (Box 2).17\n\nSecondary outcomes were the development of regional or radiating pain, generalised pain, frequency of systemic symptoms (nausea, vomiting, respiratory symptoms), crossover to the alternative treatment, and proportion with pruritus or rash on follow-up. For secondary analyses, patients were only included if data for the outcome were available. All primary and secondary outcomes were decided a priori and registered with the ethics committee.\n\nFor all outcomes, a P\u00a0value of less than 0.05\u00a0was considered to indicate statistical significance. Proportions were compared using Fisher\u2019s exact test.\n\nThe sample size was based on the assumption that a reduction in pain would be reported by 30% of patients after ice treatment and 48% after heat treatment.10 Our study was powered at 80% to detect a 20% absolute increase in patients with clinically important pain reduction after hot water immersion compared with ice packs, at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. The number of patients required was 190.\n\nA halfway interim analysis was planned because of the possibility that the treatment effect of hot water immersion would be greater, using a stopping rule that required a two-sided P\u00a0value of 0.01\u00a0for the primary outcome. The main analysis was by intention to treat. A second planned analysis included only nematocyst-confirmed Physalia stings.\n\nTo address the baseline imbalance in pain severity between the two groups, we simulated subgroups of patients matched for baseline VAS scores (VAS of hot water and ice treatment patients within 2\u00a0mm or less of each other) and re-examined them for the primary outcome. Details of the simulations using Mathematica 5.1.1\u00a0are available from the authors.\n\nAll statistical analyses were done using StatXact version 4.0\u00a0(Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, Mass, USA), StatsDirect version 2.4.4\u00a0(StatsDirect Ltd, Cheshire, UK) and Mathematica version 5.1.1\u00a0(Wolfram Research Inc, Cham...

We investigated the consequences of 2 missense mutations, R768W and Q1382R, of nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of the multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2; ABCC2) that were previously identified in patients with DJS. Pulse chase analysis revealed that the precursor form of the wild-type and Q1382R MRP2 were converted to the mature form, which is resistant to endoglycosidase H (Endo H) in about 60 minutes. However, the precursor form of the R768W MRP2, which is sensitive to endoglycosidase H, was degraded within 120 minutes and did not mature to the fully glycosylated form. Proteasome inhibitors inhibited the degradation of the precursor form of the R768W MRP2. Unlike the R768W MRP2, the Q1382R MRP2 was mainly localized on the apical membrane in the wild-type form. However, efflux of glutathione monochlorobimane (GS-MCLB) and ATP-dependent leukotriene C4 (LTC4) uptake into plasma membrane vesicles from cells expressing the Q1382R MRP2 were markedly reduced, suggesting that the Q1382R MRP2 on the apical membrane was nonfunctional. Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping with 8-azido-[\u03b1-32P]ATP in the wild-type MRP2 was stimulated by estradiol glucuronide (E217\u03b2G) in a concentration-dependent manner but that in the Q1382R MRP2 was not. In conclusion, the R768W mutation causes deficient maturation and impaired sorting, and the Q1382R mutation does not affect maturation or sorting but impairs the substrate-induced ATP hydrolysis.",

Implications for the latent structure of emotional dysregulation\nAuthor(s):Sprague, Jenessa\nDirector of Research:Verona, Edelyn\nDoctoral Committee Chair(s):Verona, Edelyn\nDoctoral Committee Member(s):Allen, Nicole E.; Heller, Wendy; Roberts, Brent W.; Miller, Gregory A.\nDepartment \/ Program:Psychology\nDegree Granting Institution:University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nBorderline Personality Disorder\nEmotion Dysregulation\nAbstract:Although research supports the existence of primary and secondary psychopathy variants in men, little work has examined psychopathy variants in women. Research on gender differences is important, as evidence suggests that the interaction of the interpersonal-affective (F1) and impulsive-antisocial (F2) features of psychopathy is associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD) in women. This has prompted some theorists to propose that secondary psychopathy actually represents a female manifestation of BPD among women. However, empirical research in this area is lacking. Towards this end, the current project sought to achieve three goals using archival data collected across three different studies. These studies examined whether BPD, as well as the emotional dysregulation associated with the disorder, manifests in terms of secondary psychopathy in women. First, Studies 1 and 2 tested the hypothesis that the interaction of the two psychopathy factors is associated with BPD in women (Goal #1). Across both studies, results indicated that the interaction of F1 and F2 traits was associated with BPD in women; this association was found to be specific to women in Study 1. Second, the current investigation moved beyond the BPD diagnosis in order to clarify how the underlying pathology associated with the disorder (i.e., emotional dysregulation) relates to psychopathy across genders (Goal #2). Before this could be accomplished, Study 3 evaluated four competing models of emotional dysregulation in men versus women \u2013 (1) a two-factor hierarchical model; (2) a developmental model; (3) a two-factor model; and (4) a one-factor model. Analyses revealed that emotional dysregulation is best represented by a one-factor model and, moreover, that this model demonstrates at least partial measurement invariance across genders. Supplementary analyses further clarified how the one-factor model relates to existing internalizing and externalizing dimensions of psychopathology. Lastly, Study 3 determined whether the aforementioned relationship between the psychopathy factors and BPD in women is generalizable to the broader construct of emotional dysregulation. Namely, Study 3 examined whether the one-factor model of emotional dysregulation established per Goal 2 phenotypically manifests in terms of secondary psychopathy in women versus men (Goal #3). Similar to the findings of Goal #1, results indicated that the interaction of F1 and F2 psychopathy scores is associated with emotional dysregulation among women, but not men. This observed association between psychopathy and emotional dysregulation was also not accounted for by a history of childhood abuse. The findings of the current project are important for informing work on dimensional conceptualizations of personality psychopathology, moving towards more empirically-derived psychopathology constructs, and refining how their manifestations are understood across genders.\nIssue Date:2013-08-22\nRights Information:Copyright 2013 Jenessa Sprague\nDate Available in IDEALS:2013-08-22\nDate Deposited:2013-08\n\nThis item appears in the following Collection(s)\n\nItem Statistics",

Carbamazepine or phenytoin was withdrawn over the next 4 weeks; then patients entered a 12-week monotherapy period. Study drug treatment was discontinued in patients who met predetermined escape criteria for seizure worsening.\n\n\nMore patients receiving LTG were successfully maintained on monotherapy compared with patients receiving VPA (56% versus 20%; p < 0.001). The time to meet the escape criteria was also significantly longer in LTG-treated patients (median = 168 days) than in VPA-treated patients (median = 57 days; p = 0.001). The incidence of adverse events during the monotherapy period was lower than during the transition period. Four LTG patients and five VPA patients reported serious adverse events. Two of those patients experienced a rash that led to withdrawal soon after adding LTG to carbamazepine.\n\n\nWe conclude that LTG is effective and well tolerated when administered as monotherapy in adult patients with partial seizures.\n\n[PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\nPubMed Commons home\n\nPubMed Commons\n\nHow to join PubMed Commons\n\n    Supplemental Content\n\n    Loading ...\n    Write to the Help Desk",

Its role in the detection of breast cancer is evaluated.\nMETHODS: In this prospective clinical trial, 92 patients for whom a breast biopsy was recommended\u00a0based on prior mammogram or ultrasound underwent DITI. Three scores were generated: an overall risk\u00a0score in the screening mode, a clinical score based on patient information, and a third assessment by\u00a0artificial neural network.\nRESULTS: Sixty of 94 biopsies were malignant and 34 were benign. DITI identified 58 of 60\u00a0malignancies, with 97% sensitivity, 44% specificity, and 82% negative predictive value depending on\nthe mode used. Compared to an overall risk score of 0, a score of 3 or greater was significantly more\u00a0likely to be associated with malignancy (30% vs 90%, P \u0001 .03).\nCONCLUSION: DITI is a valuable adjunct to mammography and ultrasound, especially in women\u00a0with dense breast parenchyma.\n\u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Pairs of marmosets were exposed to varying challenge doses of Francisella tularensis by the airborne route and monitored for up to 14 days postchallenge (p.c.). Lethal infection was achieved following a retained dose of less than 10 bacterial colony-forming units (CFU). However, precise LD(50) determination was not possible. The model was characterized using a target challenge dose of approximately 100 CFU. Increased core body temperature was the first indicator of disease, at approximately 2.5 days p.c. Overt clinical signs were first observed 12-18 h after the temperature increase. Significantly decreased activity was observed after approximately 3 days. All animals succumbed to infection between 4.5 and 7 days p.c. At postmortem examination, gross pathology was evident in the liver, spleen and lungs of all animals and high bacterial numbers were detected in all the organs assessed. Bacteraemia was demonstrated in all animals postmortem. Histopathological observations included severe suppurative bronchopneumonia, severe multifocal pyogranulomatous hepatitis, splenitis and lymphadenitis. Tularaemia disease progression in the common marmoset therefore appears to be consistent with the disease seen in humans and other animal models. The common marmoset may therefore be considered a suitable model for further studies of inhalational tularaemia.\n\nOriginal publication\n\n\n\n\nJournal article\n\n\nInternational journal of experimental pathology\n\nPublication Date\n\n\n\n\n\n109 - 118\n\n\nBiomedical Sciences, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK.\n\n\nLiver, Lung, Kidney, Spleen, Animals, Callithrix, Francisella tularensis, Tularemia, Pneumonia, Bacterial, Disease Models, Animal, Disease Progression, Disease Susceptibility, Colony Count, Microbial, Lethal Dose 50, Inhalation Exposure, Virulence, Female, Male",
