Daugherty Friday, 30 May 2014 Posted in 2014, Uncategorised\n\nOn May 15th, states were required to certify compliance, or provide assurances that it would eventually come into compliance, with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). This week, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ), only two states have certified full compliance with PREA: New Hampshire and New Jersey. Forty-six states provided assurances that they will continue to work on full implementation and seven state Governors completely rebuked the federal statute and stated they would absolutely NOT comply. These states include: Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Nebraska, Texas, Utah, and Florida.\n\nImpact of PREA: Advocates Pushing For Implementation, Reform, and Transparency\n\nFriday, 16 May 2014 Posted in 2014, Research & Policy\n\nAs we wrap up our PREA \"There's No Excuse\" \u00a0Week of Action, we wanted to highlight efforts across the country and give everyone one more chance to support PREA implementation this week.\n\nHow Will Your State Handle Youthful Inmates? PREA Deadline Today\n\nThursday, 15 May 2014 Posted in 2014, Take Action Now\n\nToday, Governors across the country will certify whether the state is in compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and make assurances to the Department of Justice that the state will use federal resources to come into compliance with PREA.\n\nTwo Days Until PREA Compliance Certification: The Youthful Inmate Standard Matters\n\nTuesday, 13 May 2014 Posted in 2014, Take Action Now\n\nPrisons and jails across the United States house youth under 18 with adults every single day. The most recent data from the Department of Justice, Bureau of Statistics reports that nearly 4500 youth are held in jails and nearly 2000 in prisons on any given day. According to the new data, Florida houses over 200 youth each day in adult prison, Louisiana and New York, 178 and 182 respectively, Connecticut 143, North Carolina 115, and Michigan and Texas, 106 and 104. Georgia houses nearly 100.\n\nReport Shows Florida Prosecutors Abuse Direct File Power\n\nWednesday, 23 April 2014 Posted in 2014, Research & Policy\n\nIn a recent report titled \u201cBranded for Life,\u201d the Human Rights Watch condemned the state of Florida\u2019s outdated policies of allowing juveniles to be moved to the adult court through \u201cdirect file.\u201d This policy allows a prosecutor to have unfettered discretion to move any juvenile offender under 18 into the adult court. \u201cFlorida transfers more children out of the juvenile system and into adult court than any other state. In the last five years alone, more than 12,000 juvenile crime suspects in Florida were transferred to the adult court system.\u201d Roughly 98% of Florida youth in adult courts are there because of the arbitrary decisions of prosecutors stemming from this \u201cdirect file\u201d process.\n\nGovernors Must Certify PREA Compliance or Face Fiscal Penalties by May 2014\n\nCarmen Daugherty Thursday, 13 February 2014 Posted in 2014, Uncategorised\n\nOn February 11th, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a letter to state governors reminding them of their obligations under the\u00a0Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA)\u00a0and setting a strict deadline for governor certification of compliance. Per the PREA standards, states risk losing valuable federal dollars--such as the Bureau of Justice Assistance's Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Formula Program and the\u00a0Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's (OJJDP) Act Formula Grant Program--if unable to provide DOJ with certification of compliance or assurance that money will be used to come into compliance. \u00a0\n\nA governor's certification of full compliance, \"shall apply to all facilities in the State under the operational control of the State's executive branch, including facilities operated by private entities on behalf of the State's executive branch.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 115.501(b). By May 15th 2014, governors must provide DOJ with such a certification or provide DOJ with an assurance that the state will use no less than 5% of its federal grant dollars to come into the compliance \"in the future.\"\nWhile we applaud DOJ for setting a certification date, we wonder how many states will actually be able to certify compliance by May 2014. Although the PREA standards have been in effect since August 2012, it is unclear what progress has been made in the states since audits began in August 2013. We also wonder how long state governors can promise to use federal dollars to come into compliance without actually taking any substantive steps to keep corrections facility residents safe.\nConsidering that nearly 100,000 youth are held in adult jails and prisons each year, how long can we wait for full implementation of the Youthful Inmate Standard? Or are we to be satisfied to receive \"assurances\" from the state that \"we're working on it\" only to find ourselves back in the same spot we were in 10 years ago when PREA became the law of the land?\u00a0\nAs May 15, 2014 draws near, helps us encourage states to come into compliance by signing this petition urging your Governor to take action now.\n\n\n\nVoice and Visibility for Disconnected Girls\n\nCarmen Daugherty Monday, 18 November 2013 Posted in 2013, Uncategorised\n\nOn November 15th, The National Crittenton Foundation, Georgetown Law Center on Poverty, Inequality & Public Policy, and Human Rights Project for Girls hosted a Trauma-Informed Policy and Practice for Disconnected Girls forum at Georgetown University Law Center. This event launched a new policy series entitled Voices and Visibility for Disconnected Girls: Responding to Trauma. The goal of this new series is to explore the importance of trauma-informed approaches to girls in school, the juvenile justice system, and child welfare system.\n\nA Word of Thanks to YOU!\n\nMonday, 04 November 2013 Posted in 2013, Across the Country, Voices\n\nSPLC: Art, Poetry & Justice Slam in Mississippi\n\nThe Campaign for Youth Justice team would like to take a moment to thank all of you whose inspirational actions engaged, educated and activated communities during Youth Justice Awareness Month (YJAM).\n\nThrough Youth Justice Awareness Month, you lifted up the experience, voice and leadership of young people and their families who have been directly affected by the justice system. You took a stance against trying youth as adults, placing youth in adult jails and prisons, the over-incarceration of youth of color in the justice system, and the dangers of solitary confinement and the risk of violence and sexual assault in adult jails and prisons.\u00a0\n\nMany of your states were highlighted in a new report, State Trends: Legislative Victories from 2011-2013 Removing Youth from the Adult Criminal Justice System\u201d and you shared the good news with your communities.\n\nFFLIC 5k Walk\/Run in Louisiana\n\nAnd although there was a government shutdown for the first half of October, that didn\u2019t stop you from hosting events \u2013 such as film screenings, panel discussions, poetry slams, art exhibits, and 5k runs. By engaging your community, you move these issues forward and play a role in building youth justice wins throughout the country.\n\nYou showed how the Juvenile Justice & Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) matters to your communities because it sets federal standards for how youth in the justice system should be treated.\u00a0 And your actions pressured Congress to keep investing in federal funds and to consider the reauthorization of the JJDPA.\n\nSPLC event at the University of Alabama -Birmingham\n\nDuring YJAM, you took actions to ensure that the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) is being fully implemented in your states, and because of your efforts, the U.S. Department of Justice issued new guidance recommending that PREA\u2019s Youthful Inmate Standard be implemented by removing youth from adult jails and prisons!\n\nTracy McClard, Chair of Youth Justice Awareness Month, recently shared in an interview with JJIE, \u201cNo matter what side of the issue you are on, if you do the research, you're going to find that kids don't belong in adult systems in any way, shape or form.\u201d It is people like Tracy and you, that give our youth a fighting chance. Your actions inspire us all to continue this momentum all year long!\n\n\nThank you to all organizations and their partners for hosting YJAM events in 2013:\n\nACLU of Mississippi\nAct 4 Juvenile Justice Campaign\nAlliance for Youth Justice\nAmerican University Students\nAppalachian State University -Student Chapter of the American Correctional Association\nBlack on Both Sides\nCenter for Educational Excellence in Alternative Settings (CEEAS)\nCFYJ Fellowship Alumni\nChicago Grassroots Curriculum Taskforce\nChild and Family Focus, Inc.\nChildren\u2019s Defense Fund-Southern Regional Office\nColorado Juvenile Defender Coalition\nCorrectional Association of New York - Juvenile Justice Project\nDC Lawyers for Youth\nDecarcerate PA\nDelores Barr Weaver Policy Center\nDeSoto County Parents and Students for Justice (DC-PSJ)\nEducation from the Inside Out Coalition\nElephant Rebellion\nFamilies and Friends of Louisiana's Incarcerated Children (FFLIC)\nFamilies and Friends Organized to Reform Juvenile Justice (FORJ)\nFamilies of Youth Incarcerated (FYI)\nFirst Defense Legal Aid\nFree Minds Book Club & Writing Workshop\nIllinois Juvenile Justice Initiative\nImmigrant Youth Justice League\nJust Kids Partnership\nKings Leadership Institute\nKuumba Lynx\nMichigan Association for Children's Mental Health\nMichigan Citizens for Prison Reform\nMichigan Council on Crime and Delinquency\nMikva Challenge\nNAACP of Mississippi\nOne Voice of Mississippi\nProject NIA\nRenewed Minds, Inc.\nSouthern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)\nStudents Against Mass Incarceration (SAMI)\nTampa Interfaith Coalition for Juvenile Justice\nThe Children's Campaign - Florida\nThe National Crittenton Foundation\nThe Young People\u2019s Project of Jackson\nTougaloo College Owens Health and Wellness Center\nUnit...

He is currently writing a book, \u201cIslam, Slavery and Empire in the Indian Ocean World.\u201d The views in this article are his alone.\n\nBy Professor Bernard Freamon\n\nIn the past few months, the world has witnessed horrific accounts of the enslavement of thousands of innocent Yazidis and other religious minorities by ISIS partisans in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn a recent article in its online English-language magazine, ISIS ideologues offered legal justifications for the enslavement of these non-Muslim non-combatants, stating that \u201censlaving the families of the kuffar [infidels] and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Shariah or Islamic law.\u201d\n\nThe article argues, based on a variety of Shariah sources, that ISIS partisans have a religious duty to kill or enslave members of the Yazidi community as part of their struggle [jihad] against their enemies.\n\nThis argument is plainly wrong, hypocritical and astonishingly ahistorical, relying on male fantasies inspired by stories from the days of imperial Islam.\n\nIt is also an affront to right-thinking Muslims everywhere and a criminal perversion of Islamic law, particularly its primary source, the Glorious Quran.\n\n\nTopics: In The News\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Voices\nOctober 30th, 2014\n11:20 AM ET\n\n'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS\n\nBy Ivan Watson\n\nJana was a 19-year-old in her final year of high school, with dreams of becoming a doctor. Then, ISIS came to her village last August.\n\nShe described to me in chilling detail, how the jihadis first demanded that members of her Yazidi religious minority convert to Islam. Then they stripped villagers of their jewelry, money and cellphones. They separated the men from the women.\n\nA United Nations report explained what happened next. ISIS \"gathered all the males older than 10 years of age at the local school, took them outside the village by pick-up trucks, and shot them.\"\n\nAmong those believed dead were Jana's father and eldest brother.\n\nA different fate lay in store for the women.\n\nTopics: In The News\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Life In Slavery\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Voices\nMauritania: Where escaping slavery can be a crime\nOctober 20th, 2014\n04:34 PM ET\n\nMauritania: Where escaping slavery can be a crime\n\nBy John D. Sutter\n\nImagine being rescued from modern slavery, only to be charged with a crime.\n\nThat's the apparent reality in Mauritania, the country with the world's highest incidence of modern slavery. Located in West Africa, on the edge of the Sahara Desert, an estimated 4% to 20% of people there remain enslaved. It was the last country in the world to abolish the practice - in 1981. And it only criminalized owning humans in 2007.\n\nSo perhaps this latest news should come as no surprise.\n\nMbeirika Mint M'bareck, a 15-year-old girl, was rescued from slavery only to be subsequently charged with having sex outside of marriage, according to a letter activists drafted on her behalf. (It is unclear who fathered the child). That crime is potentially punishable by death by stoning, according to an expert I spoke with. The activists planned to send the letter to the country's ministry of justice on Monday.\n\nWhile India's girls are aborted, brides are wanted\nAkhleema and Tasleema, two sisters from Kolkata in India's east, were sold as brides in Haryana state, in western India\nSeptember 4th, 2014\n02:32 PM ET\n\nWhile India's girls are aborted, brides are wanted\n\nCultural preference for boys in parts of India results in some of the largest imbalances between males and females in the world.
