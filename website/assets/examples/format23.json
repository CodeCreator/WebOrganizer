We did the first two hours as a easy ride we got past the damn and stopped for lunch at the Birmingham road bridge. Then it got tough as the water level was very low and there were a lot of trees down that we normally go right over with good water. We cut some of them out of the way but there are many left. Then with about an hour left in the trip one of the Pungos seat straps broke so we had to rig that back up. Then we went back to work on the trip and more clearing. The whole trip took about four hours of paddling but when I got home and everything put away it was more like eight hours as per the Wife. If any one wants to do the trip now I would say go for it but there are some spots that a big or long boats would have problems because of fallen trees. Have Fun.\n\n\nWe met at the Vincetown Dinner at the corner of Route 38 and 206 and 530 then went west on route 206 to the first street on the right (it say Smithville). Go up that road until you see a bridge turn left just before and the take out is there. Then go back towards the Dinner stay on 206 it turns into 530 follow that about a mile the road turns to the left just before a bridge and there will be a small drive way that goes to the left take that to the ramp.\n\n\nCanoeing the Jersey Pine Barrens\n\nShow All NJ Reports - Submit Your Report\n\n\u00a0Great Products from the Buyers' Guide:\n\nKindle \/ iPad Cases\n\nKayak Seats\n\nRescue \/ Throw Bags\n\nThe Kayak Wing\n\nKayak Motor Kit\n\nFollow us on:\nFree Newsletter | About Us | Site Map | Advertising Info | Contact Us\n\n\u00a92014 Inc.\nSweepstakes Banjo Shirt",

KONE Spares and its team has been the most helpful during and after normal business hours and even during vacations (Mario) which is unseen in the elevator industry. The surveying process is easier now with the online form and the ordering is simple as well by using the Montgomery CTS numbers. As for the installation, I am hugely surprised how simple the installations has been.\"\n\n\n\"Any drive upgrade should take no more than 3 to 4 hours at best if all goes well but no more than 8 hours giving the elevator owner a running elevator the same day.\"\n\n\nChris Rivera, Service Manager Orlando, Oracle Elevator\n\nEscalator Parts and Elevator Parts for North America\n\n\"In 2014 we were looking into upgrading our Kone Miprom 21 elevators. I contacted Kone Spares and ask about the new DC drives that were available. I was put in contact with Mario Jones an engineer with Kone Spares who explained the benefits of installing the new DC drives. My concern was the installation of each drive, how many man hours it would take to install per elevator and if detailed instructions was provided with the purchase of the new drives.\n\n\n\"Mario assured me the drives would come with detailed instructions and the time to install would decrease after the first drive was installed. \u00a0We have 26 Kone Miprom 21 elevators at our installation and we decided to purchase 3 new drives and see how they would work. The drives were installed and working great, the instructions were detailed and the drives were easy to install. The time frame to install was cut in half after the first install. Since, we have purchased the\u00a0other 23 drives and are happy with the product.\n\n\n\"Thank you KONE Spares, and a special thanks to Kelly Oberhardt and Mario Jones for all your support during the purchasing and installation of the DC drives.\"\n\n\nDonnie Bearden, Utility Supervisor, Wolf Creek Federal Services\n\n\"I can honestly say that in my 16 years ... you and your staff are the top of my list of favorites!\u00a0 You are always so pleasant and everyone seems so knowledgeable!\"\n\n\nName and Corporation withheld by request\n(because, well ... you know)\n\nWe carry OEM parts for all major elevator and escalator brands:\n\nKONE, Montgomery, O&K, Armor, MAC, Otis, Schindler, Dover, ThyssenKrupp, and many others!\n\nWe have features and exclusives!\n\nSign up today (so you don't miss any):\n\nHear about it before anyone else \u00bb\n\nCall KONE Spares Toll Free:\n\nUSA - (800) 343-3344\n\nCanada - (888) 644-5663",

I came across Direct Kitchen Surfaces through a google search. I entered my contact details and received a very prompt call. Their surveyor arrived on time and maintained excellent communication throughout. DKS almost halved the quote from our local company, who incidentally said the colour I wanted was now discontinued. The order was placed and payment was staggered in a very fair way. The fitters arrived on time and completed the job within their timescale. They were very clean and tidy workers and basically just got on with it! Courtesy being the buzz word! The result is a stunning job, beautiful quartz worktops. So easy to care for. I would recommend their services to anyone. Quality product. Quality service!\"\n\n\nPoonam Agarwal\n\n\"We remodelled our kitchen this year. The goal was to make the space more modern and functional. To go inline with this, we decided to install some coloured glass splashbacks. My good friend recommended that I get in touch with David. David had recently done my friends kitchen and was extremely pleased with the results. When I called David, he was prompt in coordinating a site visit carried out by his colleague Dan. What I liked most about this team was that they were extremely accommodating and experienced without being aggressive to make a sale. Dan came to get accurate measurements and sent us several samples so that we could decide which exact shade of grey would compliment our worktops. I am extremely pleased with the results! The splashbacks\u00a0 look stunning and always get complimented by family and friends. I would really recommend working with David and Dan who made the whole experience stress free. It really was a comfort when we were able to rely on them completely to ensure that the job was done beyond our expectations! Thank you!\"",

I like the idea of a quick break instead of wringing necks, but I tried several times squeezing hard on a Canada goose and it wouldn't break it's neck. Cost Do you think this item is a good value? It was $2. As long as it breaks duck necks, it is for me. Flyway Which flyway do you hunt in? Central Overall Please give your general opinion of this product. I wouldn't recommend on big geese, but should do the trick for smaller geese, ducks, and upland game.",

This review is from doing a side by side with 08 and 11.\nThe beer pours a amber red color with the 08 being a duller and murkier color with the 11 vibrant and clear. They both have a light tan head that fades quickly and sticks to the glass.\nThe 11 smell like a cherry and clove bomb, spicy, honey and alcohol. The 08 smells amazing much more balanced then the 11 with the smell a bit candy like.\nThe taste follows suite to the nose on both beers, the 11 was dominated by belgian flavors with clove, cherry and alcohol. The 08 tastes fantastic, its sweet yet spicy, the clove has faded off a lot revealing a balanced cherry and honey to mesh with the belgian flavors.\nThey both have a medium body and good carbonation. The 08 in my opinion is leaps and bounds better then the 11, if I get anymore bottles this year I will be putting them away for awhile.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n11-13-2011 20:41:51\u00a0|\u00a0More by BdubleEdubleRUN\nPhoto of jmerloni\n\n\n4.9\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +26.9%\nlook: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5\n\nA - Mahogany to ruby in coloration, with a small but heavy cream-colored head that laces fairly lacklusterly. But this is one of the only beers whose color I haven't been able to quite describe. It's a color I've never seen and I guess it's special in that way.\n\nS - Incredible smell. Light, FRESH maltiness, dark fruits which you can already tell are perfectly acidic and perfectly sweet in all the perfect, balanced places.\n\nT - Off the charts delicious. Tastes like how an 11% beer should taste without all the alcohol. Achieves a very impressive flavor profile between malt and and hop. Really, really impressed by the flavors here. They're really pleasant. Cherries! Honey malts. Fresh, west coast IPA hops. An incredible mix. Almost just jawdropping.\n\nM - Medium to light bodied, not very carbonated. Incrediblly profession makeup of each sip in this beer, though.\n\nD - One of the only beers I've ever tried that is just unmistakably elite. And one of the only beers I've ever encountered where a brewery just set out to make it great. It doesn't fit any real description nor style. Troegs just set out to make a great, elite beer, and they have with Mad Elf, they absolutely have.

Heavenly.\n\nT - A super sweet bomb, not for the weak of heart. Honey and cherries overtones lead the way with undertones of sweet bread and stick buns. Slight metallic twang in the finish, most likely a byproduct of the munich malt. Very boozy.\n\nM - Mouthfeel is syrupy, very brandy like. Definitely a sipper.\n\n) - A perfect choice to be enjoyed after a big winter meal.

It poured a very nice deep red color. The nose was not what i expected, very little cherry.\n\nThe taste also did not really exude cherry as i expected but it did start with a very nice smooth and clean malt taste followed by spice and ended with faint honey notes.\n\nFor an 11% abv beer it is very smooth and the alcohol is hidden very well behind the spice and honey after taste.\n\nAll in all Mad Elf is a very good beer and I would highly recommend anyone to give it a try around the holidays. Its around $16 a six pack but if you can find a single bottle its a must buy.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n11-11-2011 21:35:57\u00a0|\u00a0More by MicEp\nPhoto of Hopfenpeter\n\n\n4\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +3.6%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\nBought this bottle as a start for the Christmas season.

First the cherry fruit flavor, being met by malt and honey notes, than some decent hops and spice to finish the beer. Good balance and very drinkable. The alcohol is noticeable, but well hidden!

Smudged born date.\n\nPoured a lucid tea color or light ruby red. Slight head, dissipated quickly. No lacing to speak of.\n\nSmells of belgian yeast, bananas and a hint of cherry. Not well projected.\n\nTaste is a just slightly tart, effervescent blend of spiced fruit and honey. The balance between honeyed sweetness and cherried tart really is perfect here, and I can't believe that the blend works as well as it does though. I can see some however, potentially finding this a little bit like cough syrup. It stops just short of synthetic for me, but more sensitive palates or supertasters may have a hard time with this one. Plenty effervescent, lot of boozy cherry in on the background, as those tertiary flavors take off into the drydown.\n\nOverall, really a unique beer that stands alone next to a slew of dark, stouty winter seasonals. I started off not liking it initially, as it was just so vast different from anything that I was used to, but working my way through the bottle really had me enjoying it at the end. Overall, a fantastic offering.\n\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n11-10-2011 23:42:27\u00a0|\u00a0More by Crossmd\nPhoto of josefnewsong\n\nNew York\n\n4.8\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +24.4%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5\n\nThis is a seasonal favorite of mine...just picked up my first sixer of the winter so I figured a review was in order...\nA - red, clear, dark, little head\nS - cherries, honey, boozyness, belgian yeast\nT - all of the above, and more...this beer is more than the sum of its parts.
