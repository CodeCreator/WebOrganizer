The conditions are designed to deny relief in connection with charges arising on the transferor\u2019s death if, broadly, the transferee has disposed of the business asset without replacement or if it is no longer relevant business property (IHTM25141).\nAs the name suggests, the conditions are additional, so it is an essential preliminary that\n\n  \u2022 where the transfer is a failed potentially exempt transfer (PET) (IHTM04057) that it would have qualified for relief at the time it was made,\n\n\n  \u2022 where the transfer was immediately chargeable (IHTM04067), that it did then qualify for relief.\n\nThe conditions apply to affect\n\n  \u2022 the value transferred by a PET, IHTA84\/S113A (1)\n\n\n  \u2022 the additional tax payable on an immediately chargeable transfer following the transferor\u2019s death within seven years of the transfer, IHTA84\/S113A(2).\n\nThe additional conditions do not apply to gifts with reservation (IHTM25381) where the reservation was still in existence at the date of death because there are separate rules that apply to this type of gift. But they will apply where the gift has ceased to be one with reservation so that the donor is treated as having made a deemed PET during their lifetime.\nThe rate of relief (whether the higher or lower rate) and the value on which it is given are determined by reference to the original gift and the position at that time. But if the value of the rate of relief has changed, as it did in 1992 and in 1996, it is the rate at the date of death that applies.",

For example, a person first occupies her residence paying rent under a tenancy, but incurring no capital expenditure. She then later buys the freehold. Her period of ownership begins with the acquisition of the freehold. An example of this is given below.\n\nAn individual occupied residence A as his only residence from 1 March 2003 on a weekly tenancy. He incurred no capital expenditure. On 1 December 2006 he acquired the freehold in the property for \u00a3100,000. On 1 June 2008 he acquired a second property, B, and began to use both properties as residences. He nominated B as his only or main residence within the time allowed by TCGA92\/S222 (5), see CG64495. On 1 January 2013 he sold A for \u00a3250,000.\n\nHis gain on the disposal of A is computed as follows\n\n\u00a0 Disposal proceeds 250,000\nLess Cost 100,000\n\u00a0 Net gain 150,000\n\n\n  \u2022 period of ownership 1.12.06 - 1.1.13 = 73 months\n  \u2022 period of only or main residence 1.12.06 - 1.6.08 = 18 months\n  \u2022 final period allowed by Section 223(2) = 36 months *\n\nRelief: 18 + 36 x \u00a3150,000 = \u00a3110,959\n\n\nThe chargeable gain is \u00a339,041 before the annual exempt amount.\n\n  \u2022 If residence A had been disposed of on or after 6 April 2014 the final period exemption would be limited to 18 months see CG64985.",

All other snapshots will be taken at random times chosen by the Kalmar team to protect our users and ourselves from bad actors.\nThat means that the more snapshots in which you are registered, the more you distribution of the airdrop you will get.\nIf you lend 10 BNB to the bank for 1 snapshot out of 10 total (10%), your allocation will be proportional to 1 BNB.\nIf you lend 10 BNB to the bank for 5 snapshots out of 10 total (50%), your allocation will be proportional to 5 BNB.\n\n\nWhat's an airdrop?\n\nAn airdrop is an event in which the project distributes digital assets (coins, tokens, NFTs, and so on) to users, with the most common requirement being using the protocol itself.\n\nHow do I qualify for Kalmar's airdrop?\n\nIn order to qualify for our airdrop users have to provide BNB coins to the bank and\/or yield farm with more than 1x leverage.\n\nWhat's a snapshot?\n\nA snapshot is an event that records and saves the state of the blockchain at a specific block height to be later used as data.\n\nI'm lending\/borrowing, do I qualify for the airdrop?\n\nAs long as you've been lending\/borrowing at the time of the snapshot, yes, you qualify for our airdrop.\n\nWhen are the snapshots taken?\n\nWe are taking between one or two snapshots a day.\n\nHow long you'll be taking snapshots?\n\nWe will take snapshots until the day the KALM tokens launches.\nWe do not have an exact date for the launch of the KALM token, but we can estimate the launch to be within May 2021.\n\nIs it too late to participate in the airdrop?\n\nDepends when you're reading this, but as long as the token is not released, no, not at all!\nAgain, we're taking snapshots every day, don't focus only on the first snapshot as there are many.\n\nIs there a minimum of BNB I have to use to participate in the airdrop?\n\nThere is no minimum when it comes to providing BNB to the bank, however, the farms do have a 0.5 BNB minimum debt ratio.\n\nFor whom was the first snapshot?\n\nThe first snapshot only included the funds in the bank, every snapshot after that also includes the farms.\nLast modified 9mo ago",
