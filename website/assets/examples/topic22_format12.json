        "text":"\n\nChairman's Message\n\nThis winter, the Commission conducted two major proceedings simultaneously.\u00a0 On March 27th, the Postal Regulatory Commission published the seventh Annual Compliance Determination.\u00a0 Our ACD provides specific direction to the Postal Service in a number of important compliance areas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe same week, the Commission issued an Advisory Opinion analyzing the Postal Service\u2019s Load Leveling Plan.\u00a0 This Advisory Opinion, like the ACD, was completed in 90 days or less.\u00a0 I encourage you to review these two documents, both available on the PRC website.\n\nAlso published on the Commission\u2019s website is a report completed by Swiss Economics, including a model of city carrier delivery analyzing how changes in delivery frequency or delivery type would affect postal finances and operations.\u00a0 The model could provide a better estimate of the cost of the Universal Service Obligation and the value of the letter and mailbox monopolies.\u00a0 It may be used to evaluate economies of scale, density and scope in delivery, as well as the cost structure of mail and package delivery under a variety of circumstances.\n\nYour detailed comments and assessment of this study would be most welcome.\n\nRuth Y. Goldway\n\nInformation for the Mailing Community\n\nMonthly Meeting of the Commission\n\n\nUpcoming Schedule\n\n\nThe next public monthly meeting of the Commission will be held on\u00a0Wednesday,\u00a0September 10, 2014\u00a0at 11:00 a.m. in the Commission's Hearing Room, 901 New York Ave., NW, Suite 200.\u00a0 The public is invited to attend.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRecordings of past Commission meetings are available here:\n\nArchive of Monthly Commission Meetings\n\n\nSchedule for Regular and Predictable Price Changes\n\n\n\nOn\u00a0January 27, 2013, the Postal Service implemented a price increase on all market-dominant classes equal, on average, to the applicable price cap limitation.\u00a0 The Postal Service expects that, in each subsequent year, price changes for all of the market-dominant classes will equal, on average, the price cap limitation applicable in that year.\n\n\nPostal Service price increases for market-dominant products are subject to a statutory, CPI-based price cap.\u00a0 The price cap for future increases will not be finalized until the Postal Service files a Notice of Rate Adjustment with the Commission.\n\n\nClick here to view recent trend data showing 12-month average change in CPI-U for planning purposes and explanation of how CPI-U is calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Information for Postal Consumers\n\n    The Postal Service is a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by their government. Through its oversight of the Postal Service, the Postal Regulatory Commission promotes that goal and strives to ensure that every consumer receives appropriate and effective postal services. The following links provide quick and convenient access to basic consumer information and tools that may assist consumers in obtaining the best possible service from both the Commission and the Postal Service.",

Cycling can play an important role in achieving this, as well as offering many other benefits to both the individual and the community.'\n\nLUFBUG seeks to ensure that this philosophy, as stated in the University document \"Cycling on campus\", is translated into practical action to improve conditions for cyclists on campus and to encourage more University staff and students to cycle. We encourage all sections of\u00a0the University to adopt cycle-friendly policies and \u00a0practices, and maintain regular contact with Estates Services in particular.\n\nThe LUFBUG Co-ordinator sits on the Charnwood Cycle Consultative Committee, where cycling activists meet with the local authorities with the aim of improving conditions for cycling in the Borough. LUFBUG is represented on the GoCycle group, which is about University and town cycling initiatives and awareness co-ordination. LUFBUG also occasionally organises rides and other events, for instance during the University's Environment Week.\n\nCommunication among members is mainly by email, but the LUFBUG Blog will be listing random bike-related bits as and when the webmaster finds it. The LUFBUG Co-ordinator sends out email updates rather irregularly, and you are invited to contact him ( with any concerns you have relating to cycling on campus or around Loughborough, any ideas for improving matters, or offers of help or blog content.\n\nYou can subscribe to the LUFBUG mailing list by emailing with subscribe lufbug (and nothing else) in the main body of the message.\n\nSite update 7-April-2017",

And that\u2019s exactly why we created CarDoor.We believe that car shopping should fit around your life, and not the other way around. That means, unlike traditional dealerships, you won\u2019t have to deal with inconvenient appointments, far-away showrooms, and pushy salespeople. Nor will you have to work directly with a car owner to negotiate the deal and plan the hand-off.\n\nTo make the used car buying experience as easy and transparent as possible, we developed a completely digital car buying experience that puts you in the driver\u2019s seat. You can value a trade-in, browse a wide variety of vehicles, get financing, and have your car delivered, all at the touch of your fingertips.\n\nLife is stressful. Car shopping shouldn\u2019t be. So, go ahead. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.\n\nCarDoor 43.630091, -79.522825.",
