We are staying at the Hilton on Disney property. My husband wants to take the ferry into Magic Kingdom like we did ages ago when we parked our own car. Is this possible to catch the ferry from the Hilton transportation??\n\n    Hi Melanie!\n\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That is just sooo sweet!\u00a0 I love that your husband is so nostalgic!!!\u00a0 You are in luck, because the Hilton bus will drop you off at the Ticket and Transportation Center, where you will have one of two choices to get to the Magic Kingdom.\u00a0 The fist choice is the monorail and the second is... you guessed it, the ferry boat!\u00a0\n\n    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I hope that you have a wonderful vacation and I would love to hear from you again!\n\n    Much pixie dust,\n\n    Jackie S.\nthumbnail image for Jackie\n\nMeet the Panelist: Jackie, Louisiana\n\nYes, I'm the one behind you in the grocery store checkout line.

I would like to visit China in August, but my ARC card will have expired by that time. I will be in Vietnam in March. What is the best way to obtain a Chinese visa if my ARC card has less than 6 months left on it?\n\nAnswers (1)\nAnswered by Tyler from USA | Feb. 09, 2012 01:25\nYou can't apply for China visa in Vietnam, a single entry visa is valid for 3 months, when you travel to China in August, your visa obtained in Vietnam has expired. Please apply for a visa about one month in advance of your intended date of entry into China, and do not apply 3 months earlier than your intended date of entry into China.\n\nIt is also impossible for you to get a China visa in Korea if your ARC card has less than 6 months remaining validity.\n\nYou can first travel to Hong Kong or Macau to get a China visa, then go to Mainland China.\nRelated Questions:\nI am US citizen and I am traveling to Spain to study in Barcelona for sprin...\nAsked by Ms.Brenda from USA\n| Oct. 18, 2010 22:27\ncan i apply 4 months in advance of my visit?\nAsked by Martha from USA\n| May. 08, 2014 03:16\nOur children used Chinese Travel document when they were young, can we not ...\nAsked by amy from usa\n| Dec. 20, 2014 02:20\nCruise out of Shenzhen, China\nAsked by Abby from USA\n| Mar. 26, 2018 02:25\nUSA citizen in Vietnam, Do I have to be in the US to apply for the student ...\nAsked by Andrew from USA\n| Jun. 23, 2013 03:29\nOn bicycle from Bangkok to Hongkong\nAsked by Claus Jepsen from Denmark\n| Jul. 10, 2012 01:32\nAsk a Question\nQuestion Summary (100 characters)\nDetails (optional) (2,000 characters)",

I have the confirmation number, and I get an error that does not allow me to link it to myself. How can I check if the reservation does indeed still exist? Thanks.\n\n    Hello again Whitney,\u00a0\n\n    Welcome back to the Disney Parks Moms Panel and thank you for asking us another question. It\u2019s always great to see you!\n\n    The answer to your question depends on the type of error that you\u2019re getting when you\u2019re trying to link your Disney dining reservation to your My Disney Experience account. If the error says to try again later, then it might be a system issue. I can usually resolve those by switching internet browsers, devices (if you\u2019re using the mobile app) or even going into \u201cincognito mode\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d mode on my browser.\u00a0\n\n    If none of those options works or the error message says that your reservation can\u2019t be found, your best bet would be to contact Walt Disney World Resort and see what the issue is. They\u2019re always happy to help \u201cuntangle\u201d your vacation plans!\n\n    I sincerely hope that this is the only technical issue that you\u2019ll experience when planning your upcoming visit to Walt Disney World Resort.

Is there any other option apart from taxis? Any idea how much could this ride cost?\n\nThank you!\n\nFrom Santorini to Bali Beaches in Rethymnon Crete\n\nHi Ruth,\n\nThere is a pre-booked transfer service available which will give good peace of mind. The service can meet your ferry and will be informed if the ferry is delayed. The transfer can then take you to your hotel in Bali.\n\nYou have a few choices of transport on this route...Of course, the sea always has the last word with ferry crossings, and for safety reasons the trip may be delayed.\n\nThe fast ferries from Santorini (Thira) to Heraklion in Crete run May to October and depart 5.30 pm arriving 7.15 pm. This is Hellenic Seaways service.\n\nFrom June to October, the TeraJet leaves Santorini at 5.20 pm and arrives to Heraklion at 6.55 pm, this is run by SeaJet service.\n\nFrom April to October, the MegaJet leaves Santorini at 5.30 pm and gets to Rethymnon at 8.00 pm, this is also run by SeaJet ferries.\n\nSee our page about Santorini to Crete (and return) here...\n\nMore information for Getting Around in Crete including taxis and pre-arranged transfers.\n\nSee info for pre-booked transfers here at Taxi Reservations...\n\nFor up to 4 people from Heraklion to Bali, shows a cost of around 60 Euro if pickup is around 7.15 pm.\n\nFor up to 4 people from Rethymnon to Bali, shows a cost of around 66 Euro if pickup is around 8.00 pm.\n\nYou can put in your Port and your destination area (Bali) or hotel name to see exactly how much it will be for your relevant date and time of day.\n\nThe coves of Bali are five beautiful beaches on the north coast of Crete, 34 km from Rethymnon town, with clear waters perfect for snorkelling or diving. Protected by the peninsula, these calm waters are great for families or just relaxing, inland are mountains to explore. A popular hiking area is Mount Kouloukonas.\n\nHire a car or take the local bus to visit Rethymnon town, explore its old town with narrow lane ways and beautiful Venetian architecture. There are the old port, the lighthouse and the fortezza to visit, and the atmospheric plazas and museums.\n\nBon Voyage!

First visit to Japan.\nThis will be our itinerary. Is it worth it to buy the 7 days Japan rail pass? Also, how easy is it to travel to the stations from hotels? Also, are all the trains bullet train? Thank you.\n\n\nHello there,\n\nThe JR Pass would be worth it if you return to Tokyo after Kyoto, if you stay in Kyoto then it would be better to buy normal tickets.\n\nIt depends on the hotel of course, however public transport in Japan is very good and it should not take too long to get there.\n\nNot all trains in Japan are bullet trains, however Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto all have a bullet train station.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\nIf this is your first trip, I would suggest that you stay close to the stations. There are many comfortable and affordable hotels at and close to all railway stations. Plus JR pass not only allows you unlimited travel on certain bullet trains but also unlimited travels on JR trains which is an alternative to metro or underground ( especially in Tokyo ).\n\n\nOrder your Japan Rail Pass Online\n\nStarting from $254.00 for 7 days of unlimited Japan Rail travel\n\nPlease note: we are only able to handle order related enquiries via our online direct support.
