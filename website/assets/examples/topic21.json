        "text":"Former Australia Test opener Colin McDonald dies aged 92\n\nColin McDonald swings Tony Lock away for a boundary\u00a0PA Images via Getty Images\n\nColin McDonald, Australia's lone resister during Jim Laker's world record 19-wicket haul in the 1956 Old Trafford Ashes Test, has died at the age of 92.\n\nIn a lengthy and reliable stint at the top of the order for Australia for the best part of the 1950s and early 1960s, McDonald was a key part of the team in the era spanning the captaincies of Lindsay Hassett, Ian Johnson, Ian Craig and Richie Benaud, playing the last of his 47 Tests on the 1961 tour of England that saw the debut of his fellow Victorian opening batsman Bill Lawry.\n\nBatting with a range of partners, McDonald was at his best during the 1955 West Indies tour and the 1958-59 Ashes series at home, the scenes of four out of his five Test hundreds and plenty of cut shots and leg-side deflections with a technique that was dominated by the bottom hand.\n\nBut McDonald's most enduring efforts were arguably his run of scores in the Laker-led defeats of the Australians by both England and Surrey during the 1956 tour: scores of 89, 45, 32 and 89 out of team totals worth 259, 107, 84 and 205 represented high skill and no little determination against the turning, spitting ball.\n\nAsked in later years by Gideon Haigh about how he viewed the 1956 Ashes, McDonald offered an unvarnished view of the conditions and how they had been prepared. \"England cheated: if by cheating you include the practice of preparing wickets to suit your own purpose,\" he said in The Summer Game.\n\n\"I mean, we wouldn't have minded so much if the pitches had played true to character. But we'd played Lancashire at the start of the tour and it seamed like a normal Manchester wicket. Then the Test pitch was like Bondi Beach when it was dry and a mud-heap when it was wet. In truth, though, Australians were poor at playing off-spin on slow turning wickets. They tended to thrust at it with firm hands, where the way to do it was play side-on, close to your body, bat inside pad. They bowled well. We batted very badly.\"\n\nMcDonald's traditional, \"take the shine off the new ball\" approach to opening served his country well as Benaud fashioned them into the world's pre-eminent team, culminating in the memorable 1960-61 series against West Indies at home and then the retention of the Ashes in England in 1961.\n\n\"Colin will forever be remembered as a legend of Victorian and Australian cricket,\" Cricket Australia chair Earl Eddings said. \"He was fearless against the fast bowlers and skilful when playing the spinners both in Australia and across tours of England, the Caribbean, South Africa, India and Pakistan.\n\n\"Australian cricket is a better place for Colin's many years of outstanding service at international and state level, as well as his club career with Melbourne University, Melbourne Cricket Club and Brighton. Our sincere condolences and best wishes go out to Colin's family.\"",

        "text":"Boston Marathon: The things I wish someone told\u00a0me\n\n\nWhen I look around at my running friends I would hardly be the person I\u2019d point to and say \u201cThere\u2019s your expert on the Boston Marathon\u201d. I am privileged to count as friends people that have run\u00a0Boston dozens of times. All of them can and will provide intricate details of the course, and are very helpful with race day strategies. You can also find countless on-line guides to actually running the race. But many Boston veterans\u00a0have forgotten what it\u2019s like to be a rookie there and the things a rookie might want or need to know. So in random order, here are some of the things I wish I knew last year going into my first Boston.\n\nIf you can afford it stay in town.\u00a0I have a lot of running friends for whom Boston is old hat, and has become just another race in their season. Travel, lodging, and meals are done for as little money as possible and the sole focus is getting from the start to the finish and getting out of town. Hey, if that\u2019s your thing I\u2019m not knocking it. But if this is a new event for you, you should really enjoy the atmosphere of Boston on race weekend. I had a positively miserable race last year running-wise but I was continuously amazed by the spirit and excitement of the city and all of it\u2019s people for the entire weekend. In other towns, \u201crace weekend\u201d is an inconvenience and hassle but in Boston everyone is excited for the Marathon. Perhaps a bit of this is still a sense of recovery from the bombings, but everywhere I went, people thanked me for coming, asked me how my race was, asked if I\u2019d be coming back. It was as if I was lifted up on a pedestal just for running from Hopkinton to Boyleston street.\n\nLeave your car home.\u00a0You won\u2019t need it. It will be expensive to park. You can get everywhere on the T or on foot. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help with the T. Once you figure it out it\u2019s pretty simple but not immediately obvious. The locals are happy we are there and will be glad to take the time to help you with tickets and point you to the right platform.\n\nGo to Mike\u2019s Pastry shopIt\u2019s in the North End. Just look for the crowd when you get there. And yes: It\u2019s that good and the line goes fast.\u00a0mikes\n\nYou can see the whole course at the expo.\u00a0I assume they do this every year, but\u00a0last year there was a theatre setup in the middle of the expo where they stream a loop of the course. It is very good. I watched it twice and felt like I was familiar with the course.\n\nThe expo is HUGE.\u00a0Get your packet. Go checkout out the big poster with all the names and find yours, maybe hit a couple specific vendors and the video (above). You can also buy your jacket there. (If I\u2019d have mail-ordered mine I would have gotten the wrong size). They have lots of other apparel too, all mostly overpriced as you can imagine. But focus on race day and don\u2019t expend all your energy at the expo. You can see all that stuff on-line or elsewhere.\u00a0hopkinton\n\nPrepare to walk a lot race morning . . before you ever get to the start.\u00a0Depending on where your hotel is, or where you park, or what T stop you get off you have to do a lot of walking. Last year our hotel had a shuttle to take us to\u00a0Boston Commons where you get on the school buses out to Hopkinton. First, they could only get so close. There are dozens of buses and they had a lot of the city streets choked. It was then necessary to walk the rest of the way to Boston Commons, several blocks more to bag drop. (Just past the finish). Then several blocks back across Boston Commons to the buses. Once there, we waited in line for a bit to get on a bus. The bus ride to Hopkinton isn\u2019t particularly short (closer to 4o minutes than the advertised 20). Once there, there is yet more walking to the athlete\u2019s village. From the athlete\u2019s village it is a few more blocks around to the start. I didn\u2019t have my Garmin on for all this but I\u2019d assume 2-3 miles of walking before hearing the word \u201cGo\u201d.\n\nThe MBTA has the most useful information for getting to and from the start and finish here.\n\nThe BAA map and directions are also helpful though missing some detail.\n\nVolunteer Map\nNot the official version but much more helpful\n\nThings to know about the Athlete\u2019s Village.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 There are 2-3 sections of the Athlete\u2019s Village. Don\u2019t necessarily stop at the first one.\n  \u2022 They have a lot of porta potties. A lot. Still, lines form \u00a0the closer to the start you get. Just give yourself enough time for that last minute pit stop.\n  \u2022 There are a whole bunch more porta potties on the way to the corrals. I didn\u2019t use these so don\u2019t know what the wait time is. But if you want to use them be ready to leave as soon as your wave is called. They are in a big lot off to the left as you get nearer the start.\n  \u2022 Aside from porta potties, the other thing they have a lot of is runners. Unless you\u2019ve arranged to meet friends somewhere specific, don\u2019t expend a lot of energy walking around trying to find people. It is nearly impossible. Find a comfy spot, spread your blanket out, sit\/lay down and chill.\n  \u2022 You can get breakfast there. They have everything. Bagels, bananas and other fruit, Clif products, coffee, water, orange juice. This is helpful since you probably won\u2019t start your race until mid-morning at a time you\u2019d ordinarily be done your long run. Again, seek out the more distant breakfast and drink areas. They will be less busy especially early.\n  \u2022 There are tents but if it were raining no way in hell would everyone be able to fit under the tents. Be prepared if the weather is iffy. Maybe a big cheap golf umbrella or poncho, or cheap plastic rain gear you can leave behind.\n  \u2022 There are roving photographers. Chances are you can get your best pre-race photo ever here. Take the time to get the photo the way you want. The photographer isn\u2019t in a hurry. If you want to take off your warm-up stuff to get your photo in racing attire, do it. They won\u2019t mind.\n  \u2022 Goodwill is your friend. We all know about throw away shirts for racing, but depending on what time you get to the Athlete\u2019s Village, you could be there a while. Go to Goodwill and buy some warm, comfortable stuff to wear while you wait, and ideally an old blanket. Don\u2019t worry. It won\u2019t go to waste. They have people everywhere on your way to the start to collect these things and re-donate them. Last year I had a really nice fleece jacket that I paid something like $1.80 for. I almost hated to get rid of it.\n\n    The athlete\u2019s village\n\nHeartbreak hill isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u00a0Hopefully you haven\u2019t hit race day never having done any hills. Don\u2019t be intimidated by the idea of this hill 20 miles in to the course. Honestly, it isn\u2019t all that bad. Just focus on good running form and be patient. But then if you haven\u2019t run any hills in training perhaps now is a\u00a0good time to panic.\n\nThe Citgo sign is a long way from the finish.\u00a0Everybody talks about the damned Citgo sign and how it means you are almost at the finish. BULLSHIT. You can see that thing\u00a0for miles. It\u2019s no different than somebody yelling \u201cYou\u2019re almost there!\u201d when you aren\u2019t.\n\nThe finish is crazy.\u00a0For a runner it\u2019s awesome. It is downright deafening. For your family or friends it\u2019s gotta be nuts. I would not have any spectators in my circle try to watch from the finish and it has nothing to do with 2013. I think they\u2019d have to get there at 5:00 in the morning to even get near where they could see. If they want to see you go by I think I\u2019d send them out near Coolidge Corner. There was still a lot of people out that way but open space right along the course to easily see and cheer. They\u2019d still have time to walk back and meet you by the time you get done, go through the finish chute, get your post-race food and clothes, etc. The hot tip here would be for them to be on the South side which is the same side as the family meeting area.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a long way to bag pick-up.\u00a0Once you cross the line your journey is not done. There is a long procession through medals, water, blanket, food, photography, and down the road to bag drop\/pick-up. I don\u2019t remember if there was any sort of changing tent. I just put on a dry shirt across from where I picked up my bag and then went off to find my wife. I think I had a towel and dry shorts in my bag but was cramping up too badly to try to change under a towel.\n\nFamily meeting areas.\u00a0Perhaps this was spelled out somewhere but if it was I missed it. The family meeting area is divided up alphabetically. If you knew this, it would be fairly easy to find your family there. Also, AT&T provides booths with plenty of cell phones to call your family or friends. (See map for locations). Of course, they have to be listening or looking for your call. Also, there were a ton of vendors giving out lots of free food samples on Stuart street of the meeting area. Most of this was better than the food in the official food bag.\u00a02015_finishmap\n\nMake sure you family is paying attention to their phone! It\u2019s noisy, and crowded. They aren\u2019t going to hear it ring. Trust me.\u00a0\u2018Nuff said.\n\nThe T is free.\u00a0Yes they DO let you and your family on to the T for free after the race. You hear this rumored but the BAA\u2019s official vague statement\u00a0is that race participants are responsible for the legal use of public transportation. But reality is, they will let you on with your race medal. It\u2019s a couple blocks to the Back Bay station from the family meeting area.\n\nGo to Sam Adams and on to Doyles.\u00a0Sam Adams is fun. They give you a brewery tour. (Yawn.) But then have a pretty fun tasting and give runners a commemorative glass. This is one of many special privileges your bib garners around town post-race. That is all well and good, but be sure to time your visit so you can go to Doyle\u2019s for lunch. Doyle\u2019s is an Irish Pub not far from Sam Adams. They offer a free trolley ride to and from the brewery. Honestly, that trolley ride was the absolute non-running highlight of our visit to Boston. The driver was the most fun guy I\u2019ve ever met and we were all sorry when the ride was o... (truncated)",

        "text":"\n\nThe heart of the difference is not ability or even talent, but desire\n\nThe purpose of life is to discover and develop your gift. The meaning of life comes from sharing your gift with others. - David Viscott\n\nSunday, April 29, 2007\n\n\"I am not fast, but I am stupid\"\n\n(quote and picture by Luis Escobar)\n\n(all other pictures are curtesy of Crew Pink Fuzzy!)\n\nMy weekend started with a drive to the airport. As I was leaving the house, I mentioned to Oleg we need to stop at REI to buy some gels - and then open a door and see a package from Cliff sponsors with my gels. Yay!\nI flew to Phoenix, AZ, where Angie picked me up, and we just began talking non-stop. This girl is so sweet and comfortable, like my own sister, and conversation flows about everything you ever wanted to say to your best friend! 2 hrs drive went in a flash, and after situating in Motel 6 we went to the pre-race dinner. Since neither one of us eats pasta, we picked some food and the supermarket and took it to the school gymnasiun where the meeting was. None of the \"fast boys\" showed up, and we joked how they dissed us, conventional runners. I've met Larry, Lisa S-B client, and a few others, but mostly they are people I don't know (interesting thing was they did know me, but I'll talk about it in report). The controversial figure of a 17 year old kid Michael Hayden came to talk, then Luis Escobar walked and said: I didn't recongnize you with you clothes on! Shh, Luis, nobody supposed to know that:) He calls me talanted, smart and beautiful, and I want to marry him:) Why is that no white American boy ever compliments women, like we some sort of middle gender? But I already discussed it in some post... We laugh, he asked why I pick this course, and I say: this is my kind of course, I don't like running all that much, I am a hiker. He looks back and responds: yes, this is what I say - I am not fast but I am stupid to hang there all day. Right there and then I decided it would be the title of my post - and if I had known how true it will be, I might have changed my decision...\n\nWe went back to the room, and I spread out all my gels, bottles, packs and carb mixes to show Angie when is what. There is no science in my racing, I take 2 gels and 2 bottle in 1.5 hrs, nothing else. So depending on how far aid stations are I split my supply. Finally we watched some stupid reality show and turned in.\n\n3 am came fast, but we were wide awake - at least until we got to the car, because driving put us into half-asleep stage. We were the last car parked at the start - the rest had been turned to the road - and happened to be behind Hal Koerner's group. I joked with him how he and the rest of elite's didn't show up at the dinner (\"uhm, church? early sleep time? doesn't fly?\") and went to check in. Kyle Skaggs was there and gave me a hag - I call him \"my favorite boy with favorite thigh muscles\", he is not only super-fast but an awesome kid, humble and friendly, and adorable too. I think of him as somebody who \"grew up in front of my eyes\" - he won his first long trail run at Capitol Peak 17M in 2004 when I won the 50k version, and then I gave him rides to his next 2 50k races he won, and I remember him looking up to me - and would you look at this kid now! He is such a sweetheart...but I digress:)\n\nI was conteplating whether or not I should start with a flashlight, but really, the light comes up in 15 min after the 5am start, and we are so tight at first, there is enough people with lights around. We sort out on single track trail right away and single-file on the wash-out. I am feeling pretty good and clicking minutes, things go well, and I am listening to my tunes. The trails are rocky - and this is an understatement. Karl Meltzer cals this course the rockiest in the country, and he is a Master on this, he should know. So we kick 'em and step on 'em, and about 3 miles in I kick one big really hard, twist my left leg landing and a crazy pain shoots right inside the left hip joint in a place where my cartilage tear is! My eyes jump out of the orbits and I see stars, tears stream out, and swear profusely - F#$@!!! It is horrific, sharp and strong, and I can't make a step. I pull to the side, holding my fists to not yell much, and everybody - everybody! - and their mother passes me. I try to move causiously, and pull to the side again. Now everybody and their father, borther and sister go by me. I still can't make a step, I wonder if I damaged my hip completely and forever. I hobble a bit, lopsided and leaping, and reach out for my prescription pain killers. Thanks to my doctor for and for saving them! I pop two and walk. Bearing weight on left leg even for a split second is a disaster. I can stretch out my right leg, but absolutely locked in pain and muscle contraction on my left side. I slowly move on to the aid station. Hiking up is a bit easier, going flat and down sucks! Eventually I come out of clearing and Angie asks me what's wrong. Well, I am not sure, I think I tore something, but I took pills and it should get better, and I will hike to the next AS and see how it goes...\n\nI switched bottles, put my pack on and moved to the next section. Luis Escobar (who was hired as an official photographer) is there yelling me: run! I am like: can't! He walks alongside me, listening to what happened, and wishes me strength. I continue walking. Whomever hasn't pass me yet, do it now. I feel like the last person on Earth, but tell myself: I pride myself in been a hiker, I power-walked 75% of this course last year, I can do the whole 100% and still get under cut off. I am not giving up, it is a far away from home race, and Angie is here for me...all those reasons flash, and I feel the pain finally easing off. I am still lopsided and can't reach out left leg, but I can make some kind of an uneven shuffle.\u00a0 By the time I get to second AS I am almost running - what Luis and Angie (taking pictures of me) notice. I do another switch of bottles and pack, thank my beautiful Angie, give Luis a kiss, and go on 3rd section.\n\nIt is hot. Have I mentioned it yet? It is 90F, all open terrain, we are high at 7,000 feet and climbing, and the air is dry. 10 miles is a lo-o-ng way, but if I only knew how long it really is...I am hiking pretty well by now, and drinking and eating from my 3 bottles, hoping just over that ridge will be an AS. Not be. I come across a snake on a trail and pinch myself to make sure I am not hallucinating. I am not, and I am petrified on snakes, so I wait for it to go away. I have a weird thought process: may be I can get bit, and then I can quit this race for a serious reason, I so don't want to continue. But then again, it's so far to an AS, I may never make it there with a snake bite. Nope, I guess not an option. I pass a creek and get a bottle of water - I am dry - and the other ridge doesn't bring the site of an AS either. I also dip my hat in the water - and it's warm so doesn't bring any relief. Every ridge after that went in hopes, for the WHOLE HOUR!! Unbelievable. I try to stay positive, and I reel in on people. This is my high, this is where I start feeling I am doing something right. I pick a person and slwoly pull behind, and then come by, say \"hi, how are you, it's hot today\" and pass on. It gives me motivation, but I am so dry, I stagger and get lightheaded. Actualy, I was staggering and fuzzy on the second stretch as well, thinking it was altitude sickness. It gets much worse here, but I keep pushing. \"I am strong. I am a real power-walker. This is a hiker's course, and I am a hiker. My best strength is mental power. This is what I am going to use - I am Russian and I am mentally strong! GI Jane, baby! Keep on pushing when others are breaking down!\" Hour...how long is an hour? Longer than you think it is when there is no water, no wind, no cloude, no tree, and you are going uphill. Who said this year's course is downhill? Does it have downhill at all? I don't see it, and when a short burst of something resembling it comes, it is so rocky and twisted, walking yet again is the only option.\n\nFinally there it is, mile 26.5. I can't talk - but neither can anybody else here - and point at my bottles and my mouth. I get a cup of cold water, a cup of coke, 2 water bottles refilled - and move on. Lots of people staying trying to recupperate, but I can't afford to loose time, Angie is waiting and worrying, I am so f$#@ng late!\n\nI stagger on, drinking, and before I know it - my bottles are emty. I am so dehydrated and heaving, I can't bear a thought of gels and mixes, so I just drink. Another creek - and I refill my bottles, and they are empty in a flash too. I come by Michael Hayden sitting on a side and try to pull him in. He walks a bit behind and disappears soon (he dropped at the next AS). I come by Larry and his friend - and he yells: I knew you'd come. I stop and explain the injury thing, and his friend says how he saw me getting it and how it didn't look good at al. Well, here I am, still moving on, lets go, boys... Despite that creek refill, I am walking on empty for 40 min before the AS, and it seems that those (aid stations) run away as we move towards them. It takes 30 min longer on each strecth than I predicted, and I can't understand it. I see Angie, and she enthusiastically tells me how many places I moved up, how well I am doing and how everybody's times are not just slow, but slower than last year's \"up\" course. The AS mile 33 looks like a hospital - runners laying under tents, sitting down, drinking, gazing...I have an urge to fall into Angie's arms and not go anywhere. Eb comes (he started 1 hr earlier) and asks me how is the day - it f%#$ed up, I say, trying to see if I want another shot of coke. My mind is far in another place, like the other side of the moon. Don't give up, Eb says. Who, me? I am not! And I walk out, almost missing the check-out point.Angie is cheerful, and it's a bliss to see her.\n\nI count my miles in \"Angie's\": I see her ...

        "text":"Great day for Dayne\n\nPosted: Friday, November 25, 2005\n\nIRVING, Texas - Maybe all Ron Dayne needed was a chance.\n\nFilling in for injured Tatum Bell, Dayne rumbled 55 yards on the second play of overtime and Jason Elam followed with a 24-yard field goal to give the Denver Broncos a 24-21 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday in a game that lived up to its billing.\n\nTwo teams near the top of their conferences fought hard and close for more than four quarters, with the margin never wider than a touchdown. Both defenses came up with big plays and each team downed a punt inside the 2.\n\n\"I'm disappointed with the outcome, I'm not disappointed with the effort,\" Dallas coach Bill Parcells said. \"We just have to regroup a little bit.\"\n\nDenver (9-2) never trailed in winning its fourth straight, but the Broncos were hardly in control. Their running game struggled until Dayne's big burst, and Jake Plummer threw his first interception since Week 2.\n\nThe Cowboys (7-4) had their three-game winning streak snapped and, like all their other losses, this one was decided late. Their four losses are by a total of 13 points, with the last two coming on game-ending field goals.\n\nBilly Cundiff missed a chance to put Dallas ahead when he pulled a 34-yard field goal wide left with 7:42 left in regulation. The Cowboys had the ball twice more in the final 4:32 of regulation, but punted once and time ran out on them the other time.\n\nThe Broncos won the overtime coin toss and opened with a 7-yard pass to Charlie Adams. Then, on second-and-3 from the 39, Dayne bowled through the left side of the line, pulled away from a would-be tackler around the 50 and kept going until he was dragged down from behind at the 6.\n\nDenver called timeout, then went straight to Elam. The kick was perfect, and the Broncos let out a huge sigh of relief.\n\nWinning on the road was big for Denver. The Broncos improved to 3-2 away from home, with three of their remaining five games on the road. They need to win as many of those as possible for any hope of catching undefeated Indianapolis for home-field advantage in the playoffs.\n\nDayne finished with 98 yards on seven carries, his best game since Sept. 30, 2001, when he was in his second year with the New York Giants. The 1999 Heisman Trophy winner came in with only 53 yards rushing all season and hadn't carried the ball since Oct. 2. He hadn't even cracked 80 yards in a game since 2002.\n\n\"Being able to help the team win is all I can ask for,\" Dayne said. \"I haven't been upset about not playing. I just wanted to show the stuff I have. It was a lot of fun.\"\n\nBell, who grew up in a Dallas suburb, sat out with a bruised chest. He was listed as questionable all week and had said he wanted to play. His average of 6.0 yards per carry is the best in the NFL.\n\nWithout him, Denver had only 89 yards rushing in regulation. The passing game wasn't much more productive, with a long of 24 yards. Before Dayne's big play, the Broncos had converted only one first down since going ahead 21-14 on the first drive of the second half.\n\nPlummer was 15-of-24 for 162 yards, with a touchdown pass to Rod Smith. His franchise-record streak of passes without an interception ended at 229 when Terence Newman picked him off in the second quarter.\n\nDrew Bledsoe was 29-of-44 for 232 yards for Dallas, with two touchdowns and two interceptions. Champ Bailey snagged the first and returned it 65 yards for a touchdown minutes into the game.\n\nBledsoe tied it at 7 with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Johnson, at 14 with a 1-yard plunge on fourth down and at 21 with a 4-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten. Dallas' last two scores came off Denver turnovers.\n\nThe close one was a fumble by Mike Anderson on the opening play of the fourth quarter. Officials ruled that Newman scooped it up at the 10 before rolling out of bounds, but it was hard to tell. The Broncos couldn't challenge because they'd used up their challenges questioning spots of the ball in the first half.\n\nWitten tied his career high with nine catches and had 82 yards. Johnson had 59 yards on six catches.\n\nThe Cowboys also struggled to run, with Julius Jones gaining 55 yards and Marion Barber III only 28.\n\nTrending this week:\n\n\n\u00a9 2017.

Add your two cents.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nNote: This article was originally posted on NRA Blog:\n\nSuppressors are devices that, when attached to or integrated into a firearm, reduce the amount of noise and muzzle flash produced when the gun is fired. Most people familiar with firearms have seen some variant of a suppressor, usually a tubular device affixed to the barrel of a firearm.\n\nWe know that suppressors work \u2013 as evidenced\u00a0herehere\u00a0and\u00a0here\u00a0\u2013 but it makes us wonder, how? How could a tube of metal manage to quiet down the sound of a gunshot?\n\nScience and engineering working together, of course!\n\n(Animation courtesy\/SilencerCo)\n\nWe know that guns make a variety of sounds when fired, the most pronounced being the loud \u201cboom\u201d that occurs when the projectile exits the barrel. This is due to the rapidly expanding propellant gases that power the bullet forward out of the barrel from the chamber. That instant pressure and temperature change creates the explosive sound, not to mention the bright, fiery flash of light from the muzzle as the bullet leaves the bore.\n\nThink of a time you might have opened a bottle of champagne. Immense pressure from the contents collects beneath the cork. When you remove the cork, you\u2019re likely to hear a distinct \u201cpop,\u201d a result of that backed-up pressure being released at once, usually propelling the cork quickly out of the bottle. This is the same concept that applies when expanding gases exit the muzzle of a firearm.\n\nThe inside of a suppressor most commonly will have two sound-reducing parts: first, an expansion chamber near the barrel will cause the gases to expand and lose some energy, and second, the aforementioned baffles, which are essentially small barriers with holes in them that allow the projectile to safely pass through the suppressor while deflecting and slowing the expansion of the gases.\n\nThe suppressor internals are precision-engineered to accommodate particular calibers and applications. The number, construction, and geometry of the baffles and chambers vary to suit the application of a particular suppressor.\n\n(Photo courtesy\/SilencerCo)\n\nSome modern suppressor manufacturers have implemented advances in technology by creating suppressors that only use baffles, while others boast only an expansion chamber. Computer-aided design and CNC machinery have fostered the development of the monolithic core suppressor. In \u201cmonocore\u201d suppressors, the internal support structure and baffles are milled from a single piece of metal that can be easily removed from the tube for cleaning (especially important for rimfire suppressors).\n\nThe reduction in noise is made possible because the suppressor\u2019s chambers give gases a larger, contained space to dissipate and cool before exiting the firearm. Suppressors have massive volumes compared to the tight tolerances of gun barrels, typically 20 to 30 times greater.\n\n(Photo courtesy\/\n\nWith all that room to fill, the pressurized gas that follows the bullet expands into the chambers, which dramatically decreases the pressure. As a result, when the bullet finally exits the suppressor, the lower pressure significantly softens the report of the shot. This quieted report is clearly easier on the ears, and can help suppressor users maintain advantages while hunting or shooting recreationally.\n\nAdditionally, the reduction in pressure eliminates a great deal of the bright muzzle blast, which is due to the remaining unburned powder combusting and mixing with ambient air. The baffle chambers of the suppressor capture much of that unburned powder too, reducing the intensity of the muzzle flash. Lastly, capturing a good deal of that pressure in a suppressor helps reduce muzzle rise and felt recoil because the gases \u201cpush\u201d forward on each baffle in the opposite direction of recoil.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that suppressors, true to their moniker, suppress the report of a firearm rather than entirely eliminate it. Users must be sure to evaluate their particular firearm, ammunition and suppressor combination to determine if additional hearing protection is appropriate.\n\nThis post Suppressors: How They Work appeared first on Shooting Sports News .\n\n\nWe encourage you to Share our Reports, Analyses, Breaking News and Videos.
