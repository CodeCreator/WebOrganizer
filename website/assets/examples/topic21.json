        "text":"\n\nThe heart of the difference is not ability or even talent, but desire\n\nThe purpose of life is to discover and develop your gift. The meaning of life comes from sharing your gift with others. - David Viscott\n\nSunday, April 29, 2007\n\n\"I am not fast, but I am stupid\"\n\n(quote and picture by Luis Escobar)\n\n(all other pictures are curtesy of Crew Pink Fuzzy!)\n\nMy weekend started with a drive to the airport. As I was leaving the house, I mentioned to Oleg we need to stop at REI to buy some gels - and then open a door and see a package from Cliff sponsors with my gels. Yay!\nI flew to Phoenix, AZ, where Angie picked me up, and we just began talking non-stop. This girl is so sweet and comfortable, like my own sister, and conversation flows about everything you ever wanted to say to your best friend! 2 hrs drive went in a flash, and after situating in Motel 6 we went to the pre-race dinner. Since neither one of us eats pasta, we picked some food and the supermarket and took it to the school gymnasiun where the meeting was. None of the \"fast boys\" showed up, and we joked how they dissed us, conventional runners. I've met Larry, Lisa S-B client, and a few others, but mostly they are people I don't know (interesting thing was they did know me, but I'll talk about it in report). The controversial figure of a 17 year old kid Michael Hayden came to talk, then Luis Escobar walked and said: I didn't recongnize you with you clothes on! Shh, Luis, nobody supposed to know that:) He calls me talanted, smart and beautiful, and I want to marry him:) Why is that no white American boy ever compliments women, like we some sort of middle gender? But I already discussed it in some post... We laugh, he asked why I pick this course, and I say: this is my kind of course, I don't like running all that much, I am a hiker. He looks back and responds: yes, this is what I say - I am not fast but I am stupid to hang there all day. Right there and then I decided it would be the title of my post - and if I had known how true it will be, I might have changed my decision...\n\nWe went back to the room, and I spread out all my gels, bottles, packs and carb mixes to show Angie when is what. There is no science in my racing, I take 2 gels and 2 bottle in 1.5 hrs, nothing else. So depending on how far aid stations are I split my supply. Finally we watched some stupid reality show and turned in.\n\n3 am came fast, but we were wide awake - at least until we got to the car, because driving put us into half-asleep stage. We were the last car parked at the start - the rest had been turned to the road - and happened to be behind Hal Koerner's group. I joked with him how he and the rest of elite's didn't show up at the dinner (\"uhm, church? early sleep time? doesn't fly?\") and went to check in. Kyle Skaggs was there and gave me a hag - I call him \"my favorite boy with favorite thigh muscles\", he is not only super-fast but an awesome kid, humble and friendly, and adorable too. I think of him as somebody who \"grew up in front of my eyes\" - he won his first long trail run at Capitol Peak 17M in 2004 when I won the 50k version, and then I gave him rides to his next 2 50k races he won, and I remember him looking up to me - and would you look at this kid now! He is such a sweetheart...but I digress:)\n\nI was conteplating whether or not I should start with a flashlight, but really, the light comes up in 15 min after the 5am start, and we are so tight at first, there is enough people with lights around. We sort out on single track trail right away and single-file on the wash-out. I am feeling pretty good and clicking minutes, things go well, and I am listening to my tunes. The trails are rocky - and this is an understatement. Karl Meltzer cals this course the rockiest in the country, and he is a Master on this, he should know. So we kick 'em and step on 'em, and about 3 miles in I kick one big really hard, twist my left leg landing and a crazy pain shoots right inside the left hip joint in a place where my cartilage tear is! My eyes jump out of the orbits and I see stars, tears stream out, and swear profusely - F#$@!!! It is horrific, sharp and strong, and I can't make a step. I pull to the side, holding my fists to not yell much, and everybody - everybody! - and their mother passes me. I try to move causiously, and pull to the side again. Now everybody and their father, borther and sister go by me. I still can't make a step, I wonder if I damaged my hip completely and forever. I hobble a bit, lopsided and leaping, and reach out for my prescription pain killers. Thanks to my doctor for and for saving them! I pop two and walk. Bearing weight on left leg even for a split second is a disaster. I can stretch out my right leg, but absolutely locked in pain and muscle contraction on my left side. I slowly move on to the aid station. Hiking up is a bit easier, going flat and down sucks! Eventually I come out of clearing and Angie asks me what's wrong. Well, I am not sure, I think I tore something, but I took pills and it should get better, and I will hike to the next AS and see how it goes...\n\nI switched bottles, put my pack on and moved to the next section. Luis Escobar (who was hired as an official photographer) is there yelling me: run! I am like: can't! He walks alongside me, listening to what happened, and wishes me strength. I continue walking. Whomever hasn't pass me yet, do it now. I feel like the last person on Earth, but tell myself: I pride myself in been a hiker, I power-walked 75% of this course last year, I can do the whole 100% and still get under cut off. I am not giving up, it is a far away from home race, and Angie is here for me...all those reasons flash, and I feel the pain finally easing off. I am still lopsided and can't reach out left leg, but I can make some kind of an uneven shuffle.\u00a0 By the time I get to second AS I am almost running - what Luis and Angie (taking pictures of me) notice. I do another switch of bottles and pack, thank my beautiful Angie, give Luis a kiss, and go on 3rd section.\n\nIt is hot. Have I mentioned it yet? It is 90F, all open terrain, we are high at 7,000 feet and climbing, and the air is dry. 10 miles is a lo-o-ng way, but if I only knew how long it really is...I am hiking pretty well by now, and drinking and eating from my 3 bottles, hoping just over that ridge will be an AS. Not be. I come across a snake on a trail and pinch myself to make sure I am not hallucinating. I am not, and I am petrified on snakes, so I wait for it to go away. I have a weird thought process: may be I can get bit, and then I can quit this race for a serious reason, I so don't want to continue. But then again, it's so far to an AS, I may never make it there with a snake bite. Nope, I guess not an option. I pass a creek and get a bottle of water - I am dry - and the other ridge doesn't bring the site of an AS either. I also dip my hat in the water - and it's warm so doesn't bring any relief. Every ridge after that went in hopes, for the WHOLE HOUR!! Unbelievable. I try to stay positive, and I reel in on people. This is my high, this is where I start feeling I am doing something right. I pick a person and slwoly pull behind, and then come by, say \"hi, how are you, it's hot today\" and pass on. It gives me motivation, but I am so dry, I stagger and get lightheaded. Actualy, I was staggering and fuzzy on the second stretch as well, thinking it was altitude sickness. It gets much worse here, but I keep pushing. \"I am strong. I am a real power-walker. This is a hiker's course, and I am a hiker. My best strength is mental power. This is what I am going to use - I am Russian and I am mentally strong! GI Jane, baby! Keep on pushing when others are breaking down!\" Hour...how long is an hour? Longer than you think it is when there is no water, no wind, no cloude, no tree, and you are going uphill. Who said this year's course is downhill? Does it have downhill at all? I don't see it, and when a short burst of something resembling it comes, it is so rocky and twisted, walking yet again is the only option.\n\nFinally there it is, mile 26.5. I can't talk - but neither can anybody else here - and point at my bottles and my mouth. I get a cup of cold water, a cup of coke, 2 water bottles refilled - and move on. Lots of people staying trying to recupperate, but I can't afford to loose time, Angie is waiting and worrying, I am so f$#@ng late!\n\nI stagger on, drinking, and before I know it - my bottles are emty. I am so dehydrated and heaving, I can't bear a thought of gels and mixes, so I just drink. Another creek - and I refill my bottles, and they are empty in a flash too. I come by Michael Hayden sitting on a side and try to pull him in. He walks a bit behind and disappears soon (he dropped at the next AS). I come by Larry and his friend - and he yells: I knew you'd come. I stop and explain the injury thing, and his friend says how he saw me getting it and how it didn't look good at al. Well, here I am, still moving on, lets go, boys... Despite that creek refill, I am walking on empty for 40 min before the AS, and it seems that those (aid stations) run away as we move towards them. It takes 30 min longer on each strecth than I predicted, and I can't understand it. I see Angie, and she enthusiastically tells me how many places I moved up, how well I am doing and how everybody's times are not just slow, but slower than last year's \"up\" course. The AS mile 33 looks like a hospital - runners laying under tents, sitting down, drinking, gazing...I have an urge to fall into Angie's arms and not go anywhere. Eb comes (he started 1 hr earlier) and asks me how is the day - it f%#$ed up, I say, trying to see if I want another shot of coke. My mind is far in another place, like the other side of the moon. Don't give up, Eb says. Who, me? I am not! And I walk out, almost missing the check-out point.Angie is cheerful, and it's a bliss to see her.\n\nI count my miles in \"Angie's\": I see her ...

Where is West Virginia?\n\n\nThis is very good news. It tells us a few things. The computers don\u2019t hate us. Our strength of schedule is relatively good and should only get better with the match-up with Cincinnati (and I guess Rutgers and UConn). Mississippi State has the chance to be a good game as well. Also, we are high enough that winning out 99.9% guarantees us a BCS berth, no matter if we win the Big EAST or not. This is also good news.\n\nWhere are some other teams? LSU is the obvious #1, Cal #2, USF #5, Missouri #6, Oklahoma #12, and USC way down at #13. Being ahead of media darlings Oklahoma and USC should give WVU fans a little excitement. As crazy as this season has gone, the national championship is not completely out of the realm of possibility.\n\nFrom my perspective, win out and the rest of it will take care of itself.\n\nAddThis Feed Button\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

Entering Thursday\u2019s matchup of the busted boroughs, the Knicks ranked 28th defensively and the Nets ranked 30th.\n\nOnly one of the two teams took advantage of this fact, and the Knicks ran away with a 113-83 victory at Barclays Center, ending their nine-game losing streak.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carmelo Anthony said his team was \u201cthe laughingstock of the league.\u201d But 24 hours later, they\u2019ve been stripped of that title.\n\nThe Nets have the worst 3-point defense in the NBA, allowing their opponents to shoot 40.3 percent from beyond the arc entering Thursday\u2019s game. They\u2019re slow and deliberate on both ends of the floor, but really lack the foot speed to help in the paint and then recover to the 3-point line. So it only takes a dribble drive or a ball reversal for their opponent to get an open look from the outside.\n\nThe Knicks knew this, moved the ball and fired away on Thursday, hitting a season-high 16 threes on 27 attempts. Anthony (six assists and only 12 shots) shared the ball, Iman Shumpert (5-for-7 from 3-point range) shot with confidence, and the Knicks looked like the team they were last season, when they set an NBA record for 3-point makes and attempts, ranked third in offensive efficiency, and racked up 54 wins.\n\nAgainst the league\u2019s third-worst defense, the Nets should have been similarly efficient. With Andrea Bargnani and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire as two of their three rotation bigs, the Knicks have consistently been torched on pick-and-rolls this season, often escorting opposing ball-handlers to the basket.\n\nYet the Nets went a good 10 minutes of the first quarter without running a pick-and-roll once. They too often tried to run their offense through the post, which allowed Bargnani and Stoudemire to stay stationary. The few times they did make those guys move, they got good shots.\n\nPart of that is coaching. Though Brook Lopez led all scorers with 24 points, the Nets\u2019 offense could have been a lot more effective as a whole if he was catching the ball on the move more than in the post. Jason Kidd has to find a way to get the ball and his players moving offensively. It\u2019s far too early to say that hiring him was a mistake, but we\u2019ve seen enough to say that he\u2019s not a very good coach right now.\n\nInjuries are obviously an issue. The Nets are still without Deron Williams, by far their biggest threat off the dribble. With Williams sitting out for the 10th time in the last 11 games, point guard duties were again left to Shaun Livingston and Tyshawn Taylor. Livingston is athletic, but not all that quick. Taylor is quick, but shaky and inexperienced.\n\nStill, Brooklyn could have run more pick-and-rolls with both, or with Joe Johnson, and just tried to make the New York defense move. They didn\u2019t and they lost by 30.\n\nBoth Kidd and Kevin Garnett cited the injuries when discussing their struggles after the game. Garnett added that the Nets are making changes in the wake of Lawrence Frank\u2018s sudden departure from the bench.\n\n\u201cThose things play a big part into this,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer when we\u2019re whole and we have our team full throttle, then that\u2019s what I believe in. Obviously, I believe in the guys that\u2019s put on the floor and we\u2019re going to give it an effort, but when you\u2019re playing teams, you want to play at your whole. That\u2019s what I believe in. And I\u2019m not going to believe anything else until we are whole.\u201d\n\nBefore the game, Kidd said that \u201cwe all feel confident we have enough to win.\u201d After the game, he asked not to be judged until his team is healthy.\n\n\u201cI think you get evaluated by being whole,\u201d he said. \u201cIt starts there. And then once that occurs, then you\u2019re evaluated. That\u2019s as simple as it gets.\u201d\n\nYes, the Nets are missing four of their top eight guys. And Williams\u2019 importance became even more clear on Thursday. But the Nets still lost at home \u2026 by 30 points \u2026 to a team that hadn\u2019t won in three weeks and is missing its most important player. The injury excuse only goes so far. And while Williams will help the Brooklyn offense, the defense isn\u2019t going to start looking like that of the Heat upon his return.\n\nTyson Chandler\u2019s eventual return isn\u2019t going to solve all New York\u2019s problems either. The Knicks are still a long way from digging out of the hole they\u2019ve dug for themselves, especially because they don\u2019t get to play the Nets again until Jan. 20. But they do have a relatively soft schedule over the next two weeks and certainly found some confidence Thursday.\n\nWill that translate into a run up the standings? Even if it doesn\u2019t, at least they\u2019re not the laughingstock of the league anymore.\n\n\n  1. justsayin says:\n\n    If they really want to salvage their season they need to get Hollins on the bench and Kidd on the court.\n\n  2. PalmOil Preference says:\n\n    As a Knick fan still very disappointed in my team. The fact we only have one more win then the Bucks says it all.\n\n    As far as laughingstocks KG is hilarious. \u201cI don speak Italian\u201d priceless response.\n\n    As far as the Knicks we live and die by the 3 so until we get some type of flow on offense this team will continue to pile on the losses. Prigioni and Udrih should get more clock at the point spot. Beating a bang up nets team was just good to sees victory but my concerns are for real with this team.\n\n  3. ant says:\n\n    I don\u2019t understand why they dont have their lineup be\n\n    PG- Deron\n    SG- Joe\n    SF -Anderson\n    C \u2013 Lopez\n\n    Then have pierce come off the bench for scoring and use garnett as liability since hes not scoring or defending.\n\n  4. nbafan says:\n\n    Kidd is gonna be a good coach, the ones who dont see this, doesnt understand basketball, i must say\u2026with this roster, and with these available players, this record is the rality. I mean, johnson is not a star player anymore, but still thinks he is\u2026garnett is a joke. pierce still has some game, but constantly injured, not to mention deron and kirilenko (who would be their elit defender). Lets face it: livingston, taylor, alan anderson, blatche, plumlee\u2026they have to play big minutes, and they are not better than this 5-14 record. So its nothing to do with Kidd.\n\n    IF its ever gonna be a healthy Deron-Joe-Pierce-Garnett-Lopez with Terry, Kirilenko and Blatche from the bench, this team are going to win ballgames, and have a chance to be an elit team in the east.\n\n  5. JimD54 says:\n\n    I think D Williams is a decent player but the Nets need to find a good healthy point guard, Williams stays on sick leave too much, and you can\u2019t build a team around a part time player, look what he did to Utah, in this league you need a good dependable point guard to run your team and D Will ain\u2019t it\u2026..\n\n  6. eck says:\n\n    Kid is a joke as a coach. The Nets should know that not all great point guards could coach. Remember Magic Johnson or Isaiah Thomas to name a few. With a bunch of veteran superstars, they should be above the 0.500 mark. Better rethink about another coach or be the biggest disappoint of the season\u2026\n\n  7. Big O says:\n\n    Who\u2019s that horrible commentator on today\u2019s videos\u2026 just annoyingly annoying!\n\n  8. NotSoFast says:\n\n    It is a bit rough to say the Nets with 5 Wins are the laughingstock of the league when FOUR teams have less wins than them and THREE teams have only 6 Wins.\n\n    That\u2019s 8 teams that one could say deserve being called the laughingstock of the league.\n\n    \u2022 mee(a)t says:\n\n      Its because of who\u2019s in this team. A team with HOFers and all stars alone would be expected to be a legit title contender. Yeah chemistry issues are a concern but to perform so horribly\u2026last year Lakers wasn\u2019t even this bad.\n\n    \u2022 justsayin says:\n\n      It\u2019s not news when teams you expect to be bad are bad. When you go deep into the luxury cap with one of the highest payroll ever in the nba \u2013 to buy whats supposed to be a championship contender \u2013 and underperform like this? Sorry but that\u2019s \u201cpicture in encyclopedia\u201d definition of laughingstock.\n\n  9. Drago says:\n\n    The Nets really have a bad couch and they are out of luck with injuries but they should have won at least 4 more games considering their roster.The Kniks are a bad team because Carmelo is not Brayant or Lebron he doesnt pull his teammates he just plays his game.\n\n  10. Wildcat23 says:\n\n    Surely Kidd would know some motion offenses to get his team moving and not so stagnant.\n    I mean you could run a UCLA 1-4 or a flex with some stagger options, horns even! Get defenders out of the paint, use the roll options and then go to the post if all else fails.\n\n  11. okc2014 says:\n\n    Correction: The Knicks are not the laughing stock of the NBA. The Knicks, Nets, Bucks, Kings and Jazz are the laughing stock of the NBA.\n\n  12. boston rules says:\n\n    The laughing stock of the nba has to be either the knicks, nets or the jazz. People wise, it would be jason kidd because he thinks he\u2019s good at management when he really isnt. Spills drink on the court and gets fined 50k, was it really worth it? no hope both new york and brooklyn never make playoffs. melo will move to heat because mainly of bandwagon like half the nba\n\n  13. Sharpie says:\n\n    I can understand why the Nets aren\u2019t any good. They threw a guy onto the coaches seat who has absolutely no experience. It\u2019s pretty bad when your best move as a coach is spilling your soda on the floor. Kevin Garnett is a joke and needs to retire. It seems like every time I watch him play he gets physically and mentally owned by these younger players (maybe he should wear his headphones during the game.) Plus their PG is injured. However there is no excuse for the Knicks. Yes Chandler is out but Melo is more talented and has a better team around him than all but 2 or 3 teams in the entire Eastern Conference. I\u2019m neither a Kni... (truncated)",

        "text":"Sunday, September 23, 2007\n\nDoes Louisville suck?\n\nThe short answer is yes, but there's more to it than that.\n\nThe big news Saturday night was that Syracuse managed to play Louisville's kind of game and edge them out for a victory, putting a serious damper on the Cardinals' chances to go to a BCS game. But this loss shouldn't have been as surprising as people thought.\n\nFirst, Syracuse may have been 0-3 coming in, but they played...just kidding, Syracuse got crushed by three currently unranked teams: Washington, Iowa, and Illinois. And Kentucky appears to really have something going this year, a pleasant surprise for the people of the bluegrass state who've been disappointed with Louisville so far.\n\nBut let's look farther back, at a game that screamed to us that this Louisville team wasn't the superior team of last year. I give you exhibit A, Louisville vs. Middle Tennessee State, a team that lost to Florida Atlantic by 13 the week before they played Louisville. The Blue Raiders put up 42 on Louisville, scoring on plays of the following distances: 78, 23, 24, 39, 1, 79. It was clear after looking at this game's stats that, barring some complete transformation, Louisville was going to have trouble beating any teams with reasonable talent. And go figure, Kentucky and Syracuse edged the Cardinals.\n\nWhat I found amazing was that at the half against Syracuse, Louisville was down 21-7, and on ESPN News, Robert Smith declared that Syracuse would get blown out of the game. It wasn't even like he was meaning to be bold or anything, he just completely discounted the Orange's ability to play football. Somehow, Smith seemed to be oblivious to the fact that Louisville couldn't stop anyone, despite back-to-back games giving up at least 40 points.\n\nIs the entire country retarded like this? Are wins and losses and rankings the only things that people look at when trying to evaluate teams? Louisville should've gone down in the rankings after their suspect game against Middle Tennessee, and they should've dropped out of the top 25 after they lost to Kentucky. They're obviously unranked now, but the rankings have made a lot of people more surprised than they needed to be. Louisville is the new Kansas State. They have a potent offense, but can't really stop anyone, so get used to some .500 seasons down south.\n\nNo comments:\n\nTop 500 Songs - Stevie Wonder, Dionne Warwick\n\nStevie Wonder is one of the greatest performers in American history.
