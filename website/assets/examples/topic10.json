        "text":"Couscous Express Brings a Little Bit of Morocco to McDowell Road in Central Phoenix\n\nWhen a new spot opens in town, we can't wait to check it out -- and let you know our initial impressions, share a few photos, and dish about some menu items. First Taste, as the name implies, is not a full-blown review, but instead a peek inside restaurants that have just opened, sampling a few items, and satisfying curiosities (yours and ours).\n\nRestaurant: Couscous Express Location: 1915 E. McDowell Road, Phoenix Open: About a month Eats: Moroccan Price: $12-15 a person\n\nIf you've recently taken McDowell Road in central Phoenix, then chances are good you've already seen the bright green and yellow sign that popped up on the south side of the street just west of the 51. And though the small storefront still looks quiet most days, there is, in fact, a small restaurant there called Couscous Express.\n\nThe new spot comes from Moroccan-born owner Abdul, who's lived in Phoenix for about three years. Before opening this restaurant a month ago, he lived and worked in Yuma, where he sold date shakes.\n\nSee also: Anatomy of Baklava with Rocio Gutierrez and Hussein Chahin of Middle Eastern Bakery\n\nAt Couscous Express, you won't have to worry about ordering one of these shakes. From what we saw during our visit, it seems Abdul brings a shake to every guest without anyone having to ask. If you finish it, he may even bring a second glass.\n\nThis is also the case with the appetizers and mint tea.\n\nJust a few minutes after we took a seat, our gracious host delivered a plate of carrots and peas along with a basket of warm bread. The tender vegetables were lightly spiced and, in the case of the carrots, held just the right amount of heat. The bread, a spongy white variety, can be torn off split in two and used to scoop up bites of food. After three pieces of bread and most of the plate of vegetables, we realized we should probably save room for the main event.\n\nEven then, we enjoyed the small bowl of lemon and garlicky olives that arrived next along with two tall glasses of hot mint tea.\n\nWhen it comes time to actually order food, the menu is fairly simple. You can have plain couscous, served by the pound, or couscous with vegetables, chicken, lamb, or beef. If you choose to go with the tagine, you can also have just the stewed meats with no couscous.\n\nWe tried both the beef and chicken tagine with a bowl of couscous on the side. Both dishes were simple and satisfying, the kind of food that's comforting even if you've never eaten Moroccan food before. Served with vegetables and potatoes, the beef fell of the bone at the slightest touch of the fork and the chicken, also tender, offered a robust meaty flavor complemented by herbs.\n\nThe couscous is not to be missed. Light and fluffy, this stuff will change the way you think of couscous forever. Even the flavor is complex, slightly nutty but also a little sweet, making it good alone as well as soaked in some of the broth from either beef or lamb.\n\nAbdul delivered two date shakes to the table at the end of the meal. According to the owner, his shakes stand out from the rest on account of the fact that he doesn't use ice cream to make them, relying on the sweetness of the fruit instead of other sugars. He also includes peanut butter, which gives a nice richness to the drink, and sprinkles a touch of nutmeg on top.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, Couscous Express also serves Moroccan bastilla, the traditional meat pie that's both sweet and savory. Though they're usually large and made to be shared, the restaurant serves smaller versions filled with either chicken or fish.\n\nBetween the bright but homey interior of the restaurant -- the decor includes shelves of delicate teapots, yellow walls, and Moroccan lanterns -- and the graciousness of the owner, it's easy to feel like you've traveled somewhere else during a long lunch here. And do leave time for a long meal, on our visit Abdul oversaw all four tables in the restaurant, meaning service was friendly if not exactly quick.\n\nFollow Chow Bella on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest.\n\nWe use cookies to collect and analyze information on site performance and usage, and to enhance and customize content and advertisements.

        "text":"Brioche Style Rolls\n\nSupermarket bread just isn't the same as bread you have loved and kneaded at home yourself... it's nowhere near as delicious, and definitely not as healthy for you (check out the actual ingredients labels on bread you can buy in plastic packets... is plain wrong). These home baked brioche style rolls, on the other hand, are like bread perfection. I'd recommend veering towards wholegrain to stay on the low cholesterol straight and narrow, but as the occasional healthy treat, these white brioche are the best rolls ever.\n\n\n  \u2022 500g Strong White Bread Flour\n  \u2022 Sachet Allinsons Yeast\n  \u2022 Drizzle Rape Seed Oil\n  \u2022 1 Egg beaten (half for dough, half for Egg Wash)\n  \u2022 10g Salt\n  \u2022 1 tsp Sugar\n  \u2022 350 ml Warm Water\n  \u2022 Poppy Seeds\n\nMix the ingredients (500g Flour, 10g Salt, Sachet Yeast, drizzle Oil, 1 tsp Sugar, half a beaten Egg and 350 ml warm Water) together in a large bowl, and knead on a counter for 15 minutes\n\nAt the beginning, the dough is likely to be quite wet \u2013 but it will come together after a good knead, and floppy dough makes delicious rolls\u2026\n\nAfter kneading, sprinkle a bit of Flour on the dough and put it back in the bowl, leaving it somewhere warm to rise (bowl covered with a clean tea towel) for 1 hour\n\nAfter an hour, knock the dough back into place (it should have risen and be up to twice its original size by now)\n\nDivide the dough into 8 \u2013 10 pieces and roll into balls\n\nPlace each dough ball on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper\n\nBrush with Egg Wash (or Milk)\n\nCover with cling film (maybe sprayed with Oil so it doesn\u2019t stick?) and leave the rolls for an hour again \u2013 somewhere warm\n\nAfter this hour, the rolls should have got bigger\u2026 Brush them again with Egg Wash and sprinkle with Poppy Seeds\n\nCook for 15 \u2013 20 minutes or until golden\n\nCool on a rack before enjoying\u2026 These are great with Pulled Pork, or Beef Brisket. \u00a0They are also delicious with Veggie Burgers or some Smoked Salmon\u2026.\n\nTagged ,",

A busy week simply got away from me, and then I was away for the weekend visiting my family - my Dad's 80th birthday.\n\nSo I had pretty much a whole week of very little cooking, and no blogging - feels kind of weird actually. But back to earth now, and an opportunity to catch up on what you all made. Looks like some great dishes there.\n\nNatashya KitchenPuppies said...\n\nHi Jayasri - welcome! No worries, we all had trouble in the beginning.\nThanks for joining us!",
