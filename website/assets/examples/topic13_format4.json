Turn north off I-20 and you can be there in about half an hour. Its awkward name comes from that of a plantation that once occupied the area. The site is the largest known complex built that long ago by hunter-gatherers in North America, maybe even in the world. What amazes archaeologists is that hunter-gatherers aren\u2019t supposed to build city-like complexes. Normally, it takes more developed agricultural cultures to do that...\n\nFrom the Louisiana Department of Cultural Development: \"What is special about the Poverty Point site?\n  \u2022 The earthworks are massive: 5 mounds and 6 C-shaped ridges surround a huge plaza.\n  \u2022 The geometric design is unique in the world and is a masterpiece of engineering.\n  \u2022 The site is 3,400 years old.\n  \u2022 At the time the earthworks were constructed, they were the largest in North America.\n  \u2022 The site was the major political, trading, and ceremonial center of its day in North America.\n  \u2022 The people who built and lived at the site did not raise crops.\n\n    The state hopes the World Heritage designation will encourage tourism.\n  \u2022 posted by msbubbaclees (20 comments total) 17 users marked this as a favorite\n\n    Whereas I hope that this won't lead to vandalism to the site from chuckleheads concerned about \"UN World Government\" takeover.\n\n    But really -- cool, and thanks for bringing this to our attention. I'd never heard of this site before.\n    posted by Nerd of the North at 1:06 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    Reminds me of Cahokia, which I had managed to not learn about either. Pauketat's book probably contains more conjecture than some folks like, but it's a good starting point.\n    posted by benito.strauss at 1:14 PM on June 23, 2014 [1 favorite]\n\n    From the first link:\n    The Poverty Point occupants vanished long before the rise of the Native American cultures we know today. The mounds survived, if diminished, but erosion wore the ridges down to a foot or two (top photo). The plantation workers actually farmed over them, the plowmen probably cursing the oddly lumpy ground they had to tame. Eventually the plantation closed; trees grew. Except for the mounds, the extent of the ruin was literally too big to see from the ground, and well-disguised even from the air.\n\n    When the Army Corps of Engineers made a routine aerial photography sweep in 1938, nothing was noticed. The photos went into the files. In 1952 archaeologist James Ford reviewed those photographs and saw the pattern of the semicircles.\n    Fascinating, but Wikipedia includes references of prior investigations to the area, though it wasn't until James A. Ford and Robert Neitzel that there was lengthy study and publication on the site.\n    posted by filthy light thief at 1:15 PM on June 23, 2014 [1 favorite]\n\n    Cahokia, or Carcosa?\n    posted by Apocryphon at 1:16 PM on June 23, 2014 [2 favorites]\n\n    Post-hole remnants show that circular structures also stood there, \u201cwoodhenges\u201d of unknown purpose.\n\n    Wow, Laurie Anderson was right (again). Let X = X.\n\n    The state hopes the World Heritage designation will encourage tourism.\n\n    Last year, I spent about three weeks on Socotra, another UNESCO World Heritage site. And one of the recurring themes I heard from locals there (including some who had worked with the U.N. on their preservation efforts) was that the World Heritage designation was actually something of a curse. They felt that the U.N. was very much interested in preserving the plant life and forestry on Socotra, but didn't care a whit about the actual culture of Socotra, i.e., the unwritten language (Soqotri) and folk traditions that were rapidly disappearing under Yemen's rule. They also felt that the increased tourism and footprint resulting from the UNESCO designation was actually having a deleterious effect on the landscape. Yemeni business owners in Hadiboh (the archipelago's largest city) were also encouraged, through the flow of tourists, to modernize and make the main island more Western-adaptive than it currently is. The Socotri are only now beginning to get into the game as tour guides, but almost all the other businesses in Hadiboh are Yemeni-owned, so the money they make doesn't even necessarily increase the quality of living for native Socotri. It was an eye-opening perspective for me on how these ostensibly valuable preservative designations can actually conflict directly with (or, in the worst case, threaten) the populations who call these places home.\n    posted by mykescipark at 1:17 PM on June 23, 2014 [5 favorites]\n\n    They also felt that the increased tourism resulting from the UNESCO designation was actually having a deleterious effect on the landscape\n\n    That would be my concern for locations that are not currently inhabited, like Poverty Point. More tourists means more facilities to support the tourists (roads, bathrooms, places to buy food, general use items and mementos, etc).\n    posted by filthy light thief at 1:22 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    Here's the complete list of sites added in this round, pushing the total to 1001.\n\n    (and here are all US sites)\n    posted by effbot at 1:23 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    Isn't there a line of conjecture that herding\/aquaculture\/horticulture was used in place of large scale agriculture at places like PP?\n    posted by The Whelk at 1:25 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    Sorry, meant to include a link to the LA Department of Cultural Development page where the bullets in the post came from. The bottom of that page has several additional links for more information.\n    posted by msbubbaclees at 1:27 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    from the Cahokia Wikipedia article:\n    One of the major problems that large centers like Cahokia faced was keeping a steady supply of food, and waste disposal was also an issue, which made Cahokia an unhealthy place. Because it was such an unhealthy place to live, the town had to rely on social and political attractions to bring in a steady supply of new immigrants; otherwise the town's death rate would have caused it to be abandoned earlier.[13]\n    posted by Bwithh at 1:40 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    They also felt that the increased tourism and footprint resulting from the UNESCO designation was actually having a deleterious effect on the landscape.\n\n    UNESCO doesn't seem to be that impressed; if I'm reading things correctly, they've recalled the original decision from 2008, and have given Yemen until 1 February 2015 to show that they're actually going to do something more than just building roads all over the main island (apparently it has the \"highest per capita road allocations in the region and possibly the world\").\n\n    The recommendations include \"empowering local communities to acquire a leading role in managing their natural heritage\" and \"establish a monitoring system to ensure tourism sustainability and its minimal impact on the natural heritage and associated cultural values\" and a bunch of other things.\n\n    I'm not enough up to date on local politics to tell if this will have any effect, but at least UNESCO doesn't just slap a label on something and leave it to the member state to do whatever they want with it.\n    posted by effbot at 2:19 PM on June 23, 2014 [1 favorite]\n\n    Cahokia and Poverty Point, two places I only learned about by conquering them in Civ IV.\n\n    This is very cool news, though. Anything that helps get the point across that there were some amazing and complex civilizations here well before Europeans turned up is a good thing.\n    posted by davros42 at 3:16 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    That 1938 aerial is really striking. I wonder if the people living there had noticed the pattern at all?\n    posted by Dip Flash at 3:16 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    A cool recent finding about Poverty Point is that the majority of it may have been constructed in as little as a single 30-90 day span, involving a concentrated 270,000 person-hours of labour - this is based on a very fine-grained geoarchaeological study of the sediments.\n\n    Together with G\u00f6bekli Tepe in Turkey, Poverty point is something of a paradigm-breaker in archaeology since the associated societies \"aren't supposed\" to have enough \"social complexity\" (whatever that is) to invest in such substantial monumentality.\n    posted by Rumple at 3:38 PM on June 23, 2014 [1 favorite]\n\n    constructed in as little as a single 30-90 day span, involving a concentrated 270,000 person-hours of labour\n\n    Going with 90 days and ten hours a day, that's only 300 people, a lot less than I would have guessed. Even at thirty days it's only 900 people, hardly unimaginable.\n    posted by Dip Flash at 3:44 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    There must be a zero missing from the hours, because the article uses 3000 - 9000 as the number of workers.\n    posted by Dip Flash at 3:47 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    30 * 900 = 27,000, not 270,000.\n    posted by Rumple at 3:48 PM on June 23, 2014\n\n    Also, hopefully the academics are smarter than this and it's just sloppy reporting, but e casual sexism of sentences like this really bug me:\n\n    Assuming that each worker may have been accompanied by at least two other family members, say a wife and a child,\n\n    Has the writer never seen photos of the long lines of Indian women with baskets of dirt on their heads building levees and roads? It's not just men who move dirt.\n\n    30 * 900 = 27,000, not 270,000.\n\n    Times ten hours\/day, no?\n    posted by Dip Flash at 3:52 PM on June 23, 2014 [1 favorite]\n\n    Oh, yeah.

Our dear friends at wikisubscribes would like you to note that this date is slightly more likely to fall on a Monday, Wednesday or Saturday (58 in 400 years each) than on Thursday or Friday (57), and slightly less likely to occur on a Tuesday or Sunday (56).\n\nToday being a Tuesday, therefore makes it a quite remarkable Tuesday, for reasons that many might not have remarked upon and probably still won't.\n\n100 years ago today, British women over the age of 30 who met minimum property qualifications, got the right to vote on this day, as the \"Representation of the People Act 1918\" was passed by Parliament. This was also known as the Fourth Reform Act. This was the first time British Women had been given a right to vote.\n\nThe Fourth Reform Act was very different to \"Mary of the Fourth Form\", a song by Bob Geldolf's band The Boomtown Rats which went on to inspire Sting and his band The Police to record \"Don't Stand so Close to Me\"\n\nThe Police in America are prevented by the 4th Amendment from making searches or seizures without the use of a warrant and 'probable cause'.\n\nAnd that, dear reader is how Bob Geldolf and Sting became the direct link between getting women the right to vote in England as well as stopping the police from illegally searching your home in America, all well before they helped to record a record together called \"Do they Know it's Christmas?\"\n\nThis has been me, Bink 333 with \"Rare Tuesday Facts\"\n\nTune in next rare Tuesday, for some more rare facts.\n\nAnd now it's over to Mad Hatter's Garden for \"Cheeky little blighter-watch\" with Robin Red-breast...\n\nLemon Quarter\nPosts: 1904\nJoined: October 10th, 2017, 11:33 am\nHas\u00a0thanked: 336 times\nBeen\u00a0thanked: 652 times\n\nRe: February 6th\n\n\nPostby Dod101 \u00bb February 6th, 2018, 4:30 pm\n\nAs a loyal subject of HM The Queen, may I also note that today is the anniversary of her accession to the Throne in 1952.\n\n\n2 Lemon pips\nPosts: 197\nJoined: November 12th, 2016, 9:25 pm\nHas\u00a0thanked: 172 times\nBeen\u00a0thanked: 75 times\n\nRe: February 6th\n\n\nPostby madhatter \u00bb February 7th, 2018, 1:53 pm\n\nAnd now it's over to Mad Hatter's Garden for \"Cheeky little blighter-watch\" with Robin Red-breast...\n\nAfter disappearing for months, one reappeared intermittently in December, and only became a regular visitor in the last few days of the month.\n\nOn the 21st December, and a few times since there were two, a few feet apart and ignoring each other instead of fighting, so they are clearly a pair. The most recent sighting of both being today, a few minutes ago.\n\nIn other news, there was a blue tit today and there are signs of something pecking around the entrance the old bird box.\n\nUnusually for a robin, it prefers feeding from the upper surface of a suet block.

Congrats.\n\nThis will be from the Moplah or 'Mappilai' people of Malabar. They are quite different from the Coorgis who are of Scythian and Hindu stock. The Mappilais are of Arab-Dravidian Muslim stock.\n\nCoorg is adjacent to Malabar but not a part of Malabar. And very interestingly the Moplah rebellion of 1921 where the Moplahs rebelled against their Hindu landlords (Mostly Nair and Brahmin) was put down by the British who used their Gorkha levees to great effect. Moplah Katthis against the Kukris!\n\nThe Coorgis and Moplahs were never on the best of terms though. Tipu Sultan in order to subdue the ever restive Coorgis had a policy of settling Muslim populations from Mysore and adjoining Malabar into Coorg. Needless, to say after Tipu's destruction the Coorgis drove off most of these new settlers.\n\nHi Olikara,\nA bit late in commenting on your statement re the origin of the Coorgs being of Scythian-Hindu stock. I have done a little research into the origins of these people as they are so interesting but I cannot find a conclusive answer. The origin you have stated is one of a number of theories none of which have concrete evidence, have you found such evidence? If so I would be grateful if you would share it so that I can stop knocking my head against what appears to be a brick wall regarding this subject.\nMiguel is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote",

The Allies did not win because the U.S. had the M1 rifle, or the Russians had the SVT 40. The huge technological advantage the U.S. had in mass production and the advantage the Soviets had in both production and manpower would have made the difference if all the armies had had only bolt action rifles. When a squadron of P.51's descended on a German troop convoy or a supply column with all guns blazing, it didn't matter much whether the Germans had K.98k's or G.43's, they were in deep trouble.\nnow I will largely agree with you here however there are a couple situations to look at. in the south pacific where much of the fighting was in rain forests and swamps things like P51s, tanks and artillery were largely irrelevant. the heaviest thing you could post were machine guns. had the Japanese adopted a semi auto rifle then the entire south pacific campaign could have ended much differently as the marines were still largely issued 1903s. in this situation the japs had few machineguns and no SMGs while the US had plenty of both, the advantage of firepower(mixed with better supply chains) is what turned the tide in the south pacific, not tanks, planes and big guns.\n\nyou are largely correct in the case of the african and european campaigns though large amphibious landings like normandy where you have machine gun fire raining down on you would have been even more catastrophic had everyone been using bolt actions instead of the mix of semi, bolt and full auto weaponry that we hit the beaches with. the rest of the war however were pretty much won but tanks planes and big guns\nignore my complete lack of capitalization. I still have no problem correcting your grammar.\nI never said half the stuff people said I did-Albert Einstein\nYou can't believe everything you read on the internet-Benjamin Franklin\ntahunua001 is offline \u00a0\nPage generated in 0.03460 seconds with 7 queries",

Suffer well concord you have indeed earned it\n\nSilva January 28, 2014 at 4:33 PM\n\nWOW !!! I agree with RANDOM TASK !!!
