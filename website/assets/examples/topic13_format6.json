        "text":"Miss Draper: The First Woman Ever Photographed\n\n02: Dorothy Catherine Draper is a truly\u00a0forgotten figure\u00a0in American history. She was the first woman to ever sit for a photograph \u2014 a daguerrotype, actually, in the year 1840, upon the rooftop of the school which would become New York University..\n\nThe\u00a0circumstances that got her to this position were\u00a0rather unique. She was the older sister of a\u00a0professor named\u00a0John William Draper, and she assisted him in his success and fame even when it seemed a detriment to her. The Drapers worked alongside Samuel Morse in the period following his invention of the telegraph.\n\nThe legendary portrait was taken when Miss Draper\u00a0was a young woman but a renewed interest in the image in the 1890s brought the now elderly matron a bit of late-in-life recognition.\n\nFEATURING\u00a0Tales from the earliest days of photography and walk through Green-Wood Cemetery!\n\nTo get this episode, simply download it for FREE from iTunes or other podcasting services.\n\nSubscribe to The First here so that you don\u2019t miss future episodes!\n\nYou can also listen to the show on Stitcher streaming radio\u00a0from your mobile device.\n\nOr listen to it straight from here:\n\nDorothy Catherine Draper in the first portrait photograph ever taken and the first photograph of a female face.\n\n\n\nDraper in the 1890s, in a photograph taken by her nephew.\n\nCourtesy MCNY\nCourtesy MCNY\n\n\n\nThe observatory attached to the Draper house in Hastings-on-Hudson.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn William Draper\n\n\nSamuel Morse from an image taken of him in Paris.",

In 2008, Susan \u2014 who resides in San Francisco, but flies back several times a year to spend time with her mother, Mieko Muroshige \u2014 was instrumental in developing the 100th Battalion\u2019s Education Center and its outstanding website,, thanks to a grant from the state of Hawai\u2018i. Susan also led the effort to renovate the front lobby area of the historic 100th Battalion clubhouse on Kamoku Street in McCully, which now features informative panels on the 100th and its AJA \u201cbrother\u201d units as well as several artifact display cases.\n\nWith so many of our Nisei veterans and their wives or widows passing every month, I recommended that she do it sooner than later \u2014 before their families unknowingly discard those treasures containing the real-time thoughts of the veterans while in combat in Europe. So, Susan got to work right away on her appeal.\n\nTo see the full content please subscribe to our Basic Online annual subscription.\nLog In Subscribe",
