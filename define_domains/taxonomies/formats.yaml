  text: "First EarthScope Transportable Array Station Installed in Virginia\n\nEarthScope Transportable Array Station R58B in Mineral, Virginia.\n\nOn August 8, EarthScope installed its first seismic station in Mineral, Virginia, near the epicenter of last year's magnitude 5.8 earthquake. This Transportable Array station, R58B, is a complement to other seismic stations in the area and is capable of detecting small regional aftershocks as well as earthquakes of about magnitude 5 occurring anywhere in the world. Both a high-quality broadband seismometer and a strong motion accelerometer were installed. The station will operate for about 2.5 years. In Spring 2013, an additional 18 stations will be installed in Virginia when the Transportable Array blankets the Mid-Atlantic states. To view the the most recent 24-hour seismogram at Station R58B or any other operating EarthScope seismic station, click here.\n\n\nBecause of the station's proximity to Washington, DC, the installation was observed by a small group of visitors including the Virginia state geologist, geoscience researchers from James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia, and staff from IRIS Headquarters."

  text: "A Letter From Voyage-Air CEO Jeff Cohen\n\nA big thank you to all of the many fans of Voyage-Air Guitar! Your comments and well wishes are much appreciated. Our email boxes are stuffed with mail from people that want to either buy a guitar, invest in the company, or just tell us how cool our guitar really is.\n\nThank you also to the producers ofShark Tank! It is not an easy thing to edit a one hour negotiation between me and the Sharks into just a few minutes ofairtime. One point I'd like to clarify about the show was the actual deal on the table. For $1 million, I was offering the Sharks a 49% stake in a new company, not Voyage-Air Guitar. The new company would license the technology to build Voyage-Air type guitars to other guitar manufacturers. Voyage-Air Guitar would continue to build its brand and build and sell guitars just the way it does today! The nuances of this deal were a bit much for the producers to work into our short segment. But, the Sharks and I knew exactly what was on the table!\n\nWe accomplished our goal of demonstrating the benefits of the Voyage-Air Guitar to millions of people and we are getting an overwhelming response! If you like the idea of having a guitar that folds in half, fits in a backpack and can be carried everywhere you go, then I hope you'll consider buying one for yourself.\n\nBest regards,"
